On Oct. 1, 2014, celebrated United g No One Behind: temptation stereotype anyone, including seniors. To end, discussion media recently increased relative struggled voice actual seniors reflected. What I instead incomplete information resulted mis-representation economic plight seniors. Statistics Canada pegs 2011 median income 65 $23,700. This means 50% seniors Canada living $23,700 year, majority living alone. Compare median income 35-44 year olds $43,300 overwhelming majority living two-person household sharing costs borne single senior. Here British Columbia alone, 52,000 seniors living $16,300 year less. While true low-income seniors live home mortgage, face property tax, insurance maintenance repair costs fixed income guaranteed pace inflation. Their equity cases borrowed senior households rented face annual increases stagnant income. Seniors face health-care costs related drugs, mobility aids, dental care, eyeglasses hearing aids workplace benefit plans defray costs. Householders today enjoying record low rates. While boon homeowners, hardship overwhelming majority seniors receive defined benefit pension plan produce adequate retirement income savings investments. It important remember that, wealth seniors (outside primary residence) usually required produce income it, unlike people receive income employment allow wealth compound. The issue low income poverty seniors picture. Seniors significant contributions communities health-care system. We know greatest volunteering seniors.

In B.C., seniors pay: 80% income cost residential care maximum $3092.66; 70% income cost government subsidized assisted living maximum varies according local market conditions; co-pay costs home support sliding scale based income. While fair question minority higher income seniors benefit caps, evident majority seniors surrendering significant amounts income subsidize care needs.
