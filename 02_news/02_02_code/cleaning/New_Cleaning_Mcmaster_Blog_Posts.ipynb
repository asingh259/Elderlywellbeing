Making situation challenging, groups expressing strong resistance COVID-19 vaccines lead hesitancy vaccinated lack information, mis-information conspiracy theories.To help Canadian decision-makers respond unprecedented challenges related pandemic, theCOVID-19 Evidence Network support Decision-making(COVID-END) reviewed known COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.(1) More specifically, examined known key domains:- securing distributing reliable supply vaccines necessary equipment (for example, needles diluents);- allocating vaccines necessary equipment equitably;- communicating vaccines allocated safety effectiveness vaccines;- administering vaccines ways optimize timely uptake; and- monitoring, evaluating reporting vaccine roll-out. This blog post series examine evidence experiences Canada countries COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. The set challenges facing decision-makers secure distribute reliable supply vaccines necessary equipment. This includes planning following:- national purchasing agreements vaccine developers secure doses available;- delivery vaccines equipment country;- managing inventory vaccines country;- ordering country;- distribution country administration sites (including directly centralized distributors administering locations redistribution allowed); and- storage handling country (for example, cold-chain requirements maintain optimal conditions transport, storage, handling vaccines).(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) leading national agencies like U.S. Centers Disease Control Prevention (CDC) developed guidelines related purchasing vaccines supplies, planning mass-vaccination campaigns.(2-3) Such guidelines intended support countries preparing building readiness deployment COVID-19 vaccines.Research shows end COVID-19 pandemic, crucial act globally. It estimated 60-80% world’s population vaccinated achieve “herd immunity” COVID-19.(4) According Mayo Clinic, herd immunity (sometimes referred community immunity) occurs large portion community (the herd) immune disease, makes spread disease person person unlikely. As result, community protected (and immune).(5) Therefore, calls international institutions, governments vaccine manufacturers plan sufficient vaccine production allocation, negotiate vaccine prices affordable low- middle-income countries.(5)The need share COVID-19 vaccines globally equitable way appears particularly challenging high-income countries secured half vaccine doses far.(6) High-income countries finalized advance purchasing agreements vaccine developers secure doses available (in occasions multiple companies developed currently developing COVID-19 vaccines). For instance, Canada established advance purchasing agreements seven companies developed currently developing COVID-19 vaccines. The doses secured Canadians wish vaccinated. But countries like Germany, United Kingdom United States re-purposed existing capacity invested new vaccine manufacturing capacity help expedite production vaccines. Given potential complexity delivering COVID-19 vaccines remote communities developed developing countries, national international vaccine supply chains strengthened. This ensure vaccines distributed administered efficiently remote rural populations, avoid waste vaccine doses.(4) And challenges likely revealed mass-vaccination campaigns unfold.

Eight factors influencing retirement perceptions, expectations planning There appear significant differences men women retirement attitudes, retirement readiness, adjustment capacity retirement. Overall, studies men positive attitude retirement engaged retirement planning women (the reporting uncertainties preparing retirement). These differences rooted individual historical differences men\\\\\\'s women\\\\\\'s participation labour market (women greater burden caregivers precarious situations). Women\\\\\\'s retirement plans closely linked health partners, men’s plans. Finally, women difficulty adjusting retirement men. Studies perception people financial situation, actual situation, influences feeling adapting retirement. That said, people better financial position likely plan retirement. In addition, people disadvantaged socio-economic groups generally negative retirement experiences. Few studies examined ethnic cultural differences retirement, prevents researchers drawing definitive conclusions. That said, studies indicate people ethnocultural minorities tend positive expectations retirement. However, plan retirement economic situations retirement precarious. There fair literature impact family status, especially marital status, health well-being retirement. Overall, marriage associated better retirement planning. In addition, collaboration married couples help transition retirement. However, researchers noted studies \"hetero-normative\" bias, is, focused heterosexual couples neglected study same-sex couples. It known people health problems likely retire earlier good health. In addition, poor health associated poorer retirement planning. However, people disabilities tend plan retirement carefully. When health problems lead early retirement, appears negative impact ability adjust retirement. How perceive world perceive tremendous impact do, when, how. Ageism workplace (which forms discrimination, exclusion age-based biases) encourage older workers retire earlier want (especially older men). Conversely, positive views aging retirement appear associated better retirement planning intention retire early. The nature work (and perceptions older workers profession work environment) plays key role timing retirement retirement experience. For example, workers limited autonomy tend early retirement. In addition, work important person\\\\\\'s identity, retirement source conflict anxiety. Retirees taken time plan retirement generally feel control experience negative effects stress. Overall, studies reveal widespread lack preparation retirement. This exacerbated people experiencing decline cognitive capacities related aging. Such decline major impact people\\\\\\'s retirement planning sense control.

This association occurs cognitive tests require person tested hear test items (for example, memory visual items tested). More research needed discover reasons links hearing loss cognitive loss (22). Some preliminary research evidence suggests hearing rehabilitation (such wearing hearing aid having therapy) contribute good cognitive health (23). However, strong studies test link improving one’s hearing improving one’s cognition beginning. We know hearing loss prevent minimize cognitive changes.

In Parts 1 2, discussed aging-related hearing loss, ear brain work listen everyday life. In Part 3, discuss results basic hearing test, audiogram, tell hearing difficulties why. The audiogram tell hearing thresholds. A hearing threshold quietest sound (measured decibels hearing level (dB HL)) hear sound. The sound pin drop near hearing threshold person good hearing. During basic hearing test, thresholds measured tones different frequencies (measured Hertz cycles second) cover range octaves. You think frequencies tones test different notes played piano keyboard. Different frequencies different pitches; like piano notes, lower pitch (more bass) higher pitch (more treble). The results basic hearing test plotted ear graph called audiogram. According International Organization Standardization (ISO), Figure 1a 1b shows typical audiograms women men different ages (1). Compared typical audiograms, half population better hearing thresholds; is, thresholds fall line specific age gender group. People hear quiet sounds thresholds near audiogram. Similarly, half population poorer hearing thresholds; is, results fall line specific age gender group. People hear sounds sounds louder thresholds nearer audiogram. If hearing test, compare audiogram ISO curve age gender group thresholds better worse. As age, hearing thresholds higher frequencies usually change thresholds lower frequencies. That is, usually hear high-frequency (treble) sounds low-frequency (bass) sounds. This means takes decibels high-frequency (treble) sounds loud older people hear them. Quiet, high-frequency sounds like clock ticking bird chirping impossible hear. Hearing loss higher frequencies common consider type hearing loss ‘normal’ older adults. However, definition normal hearing World Health Organization adjusted age (2). Hearing considered clinically normal thresholds 0 25 dB HL. The green section (top Figure 1a) shows normal hearing range. If threshold green box normal. If like older people normal thresholds lower frequencies higher frequencies. The red line Figure 1a shows typical 70-year old woman high-frequency hearing thresholds worse clinically normal range (below green box). This case, hearing thresholds typical age gender. This means typical hearing age gender, thresholds good younger person considered clinically normal. Thresholds audiogram interpreted follows: Figure 1: Audiograms women panel men panel (adapted International Organization Standardization (1)). Conversation lot louder pin drop. The blue line audiogram Figure 1a 1b shows average level conversation 45 dB HL, This means people normal hearing thresholds difficulty hearing conversation plenty louder hearing thresholds. Speech sounds heard faintly people mild hearing loss. Speech sounds heard people moderate greater hearing loss. Older people typical age-related hearing loss, poorer thresholds higher frequencies, hear speech sounds hear speech sounds all. The difficult speech sounds hear consonants (e.g., p, f, t, k) speech sounds rely higher frequencies. Vowels easier hear rely lower frequencies. Older adults complain “I hear people talking voices clear hard understand saying”. Although people hearing loss blame people mumbling, likely explanation older person typical high-frequency hearing loss hear speech sounds misses speech sounds people talking. Although audiogram good test measuring quietest sounds hear, hearing problems older adults fully explained audiogram. Even sounds loud enough, older adults normal audiograms, common complain hearing problems, especially trying listen busy, noisy, group situations. To understand people trouble hearing sounds loud enough, know goes wrong auditory (hearing) people age. Researchers realized long time aging result different types hearing loss (3). Carefully controlled research animals provided evidence types hearing loss worsen age (4). Two types result poorer thresholds high-frequency sounds explain changes audiogram discussed earlier. Type 1: In type, outer hair cells inner ear damaged. This damage occurs usually exposed environmental factors high noise levels. Younger adults work industrial noise type hearing loss. Type 2: The second type involves changes blood supply inner ear alter chemistry. These chemical changes ear compared battery going flat (5). This type occurs older adults. Type 3: The type involves damage nerves connecting ear brain. Recent evidence suggests lifelong exposure noise cause neural damage auditory nerves. This nerve damage disrupts way information ear delivered brain (1). Such damage occur noise loud permanently change hearing thresholds. As people age, develop combination types age-related hearing loss, Type 3, neural damage, detected audiogram. Speak doctor audiogram appears normal age having problems hearing daily life. Of course, problems high-frequency hearing loss sounds simply heard. Making sounds louder (for example, hearing aid) help bring sounds audible range. In general, better hear sounds hear them. However, people, especially type age-related hearing loss described (Type 1: damage outer hair cells inner ear), actually able tolerate loud sounds. This means hearing aid circuits need sounds loud protect hearing aid wearer sounds loud. In addition, people hearing loss, making sounds loud hear necessarily sounds clearer. The clarity sound reduced ear longer analyze sounds properly. It common difficulties picking sound sounds heard time. For people type age-related hearing loss described (Type 3: neural damage), problems reduced clarity feeling sounds jumbled happen person’s audiogram normal. Making sounds louder solve listening problems, especially resulting neural damage. These problems loudness signals sent ears brain. The good news that, making sounds louder enough, solutions help solve problems older listeners daily life (see Part 4).

This blog discusses reasons oral health important age neglecting oral health older adults, especially long term care homes (LTCH), considered form elder abuse. The #1 cause death LTCH residents pneumonia link oral health known (1;2)! Pneumonia acquired bacteria laden secretions travel lungs. There accumulation bacteria dental plaque bacteria sits mouth, teeth (including dentures), oral mucosa, gums,. The bacteria easily travel respiratory tract pneumonia. There evidence maintaining adequate oral hygiene prevent pneumonia (3;4). Approximately 10 cases death pneumonia LTCH residents prevented improving oral hygiene (3). This clearly supports belief dentists, dental hygienists, health professionals brushing teeth save lives! But unable brush teeth? What unable proper cleaning recommended \\'two minutes day, twice day, especially meals\\'. This situation older adults, particularly living LTCH. Some estimates suggest oral diseases affect 95 percent Canadian adults (5;6). Older adults particularly high risk oral health problems, poor oral health seniors linked general systemic health risks, cardiovascular disease, stroke, poor nutrition, glycemic control people diabetes respiratory infection (7;8). Despite growing body evidence, mouth forgotten neglected. The oral cavity generally relegated realm dentist, residents living LTCH typically seen best seen infrequently. The potential creating additional health problems lack emphasis oral care significant. As age, greater changes teeth gums require care (7). As well, older adults greater challenges with: Typically medications (over 400 types) cause dry mouth; problem worse older adults medications. As well, teeth mouth require attention age. Unfortunately, attention provided acute long term care hospitals. Studies shown (9) missed nursing- care opportunities regards mouth care acute care hospitals. The issue oral care greater health problem LTCH. Older adults living LTCH require greater assistance personal care. Although care providers LTCH tasked performing personal care activities, oral care tends neglected (8). As dentist spent decade visiting 140 LTCH acute care hospitals treating older adults, I learned degree oral care provided. Surprisingly, little time allotted oral hygiene. I wondered examination assessment oral cavity admission LTCH responsible this. When visiting seniors LTCH, I look daily regimen checklist shows degree oral health care resident receiving. This checklist difficult documented. From dentist\\'s perspective, care plan critical life-saving delivering medications prevent health problems, pneumonia. Inconsistent oral care LTCH associated lack of: There challenges staff residents LTCH establishing consistent adequate oral health care. Fear, perceived difficulty, lack knowledge, uncooperative residents, lack supplies, lack time, lack staff reported barriers oral care (8). The training health care aids nursing staff, recently, limited regards oral care generally, care elderly (8;10). As dentist, I health care professionals don\\'t understand adverse effects medications oral cavity (or severe consequences dry mouth). Nor identify problems mouth understand effects fractured/broken teeth one\\'s health. A secondary problem limited preventative guidelines referral guidelines health care workers follow comes oral health. Currently, extensively tested evidence-based oral care protocols exist institutionalized elderly (8). Moreover, dental profession itself, practice guidelines fully developed implemented (8). Even guidelines existed, typically frontline staff (nurses health care aides) appropriate tools examine treat mouth; trained use tools. The problem difficult residents dementia. How help brushing teeth resistant care confusion cognitive changes? A pilot study \\'Managing Oral Hygiene Threat Reduction (MOUTh)\\' approach shown promising results. The MOUTh approach gives providing care method deliver oral hygiene older adults resist help (11). Nevertheless, health care providers LTCH need clear guidance documented plans assist challenging situations. A final problem residents LTCH evaluated dentist teeth cleaned hygienist regular basis. Dentists dental hygienists, experts care mouth teeth, healthcare team. Many health care providers don\\'t link oral health risk poor health outcomes. If health care workers trained understanding issues related oral health, likely prioritize relative care activities. There need stress nature oral health problems. For example, adults recognize healthy gums bleed, seek dental care problem. Similarly, health care providers residents bleeding gums, understand concerning health problem. If doctor saw cut wound patient continued bleed, surely seek stop bleeding. However, resident\\'s gums continue bleed, lack understanding equally serious. There tendency forget consider mouth possible source care concerns. For example, resident eating, care providers consider evaluating resident\\'s mouth possible source problem. Perceptions realities huge perception residents, caregivers health care providers perceive dental care necessary daily care. Likely, way caregivers prioritize dental care directly related beliefs culture. As dentist, message residents, families, health care providers oral care basic necessary care age, especially age. All need \\'brush up\\' mouth care, health life depend it. Thus far, seen residents LTCH receive adequate oral hygiene dental care variety reasons. For residents enjoy better health, comfort, confidence, quality life personal dignity good oral hygiene essential. If neglected leads pain, eating problems, speech difficulties, bad breath poor appearance. More importantly, lead health concerns death. So lack oral hygiene dental care related elder abuse neglect? We defined dental elder abuse \\'when person prevents person receiving necessary basic oral care\\' (12;13). Until recently, lack recognition definition elder abuse related oral hygiene. Caregivers older adults neglect oral health inadvertently exposing loved ones abuse. Very little known magnitude type abuse linked oral health neglect abuse. For reason started new initiative investigate type abuse (12;13). In near future hope information elder neglect abuse context oral hygiene. So I turn frown upside read this? We decrease risk pneumonia health problems LTCH providing good oral hygiene. We need increase awareness levels providing daily comprehensive oral care basic care necessity.

However, provincial drug plans provide coverage medications. This blog examines drugs available treat AD Canada. Health Canada approved drugs treat cognitive symptoms Alzheimer’s disease (AD): donepezil (Aricept® generics), rivastigmine (Exelon® generics), galantamine (Reminyl® generics), memantine (Ebixa® generics). These drugs known “cognitive enhancers”. The approved use persons mild moderate AD, memantine approved use persons moderate severe AD. These drugs cure AD, stop disease getting worse. Rather, AD drugs treat cognitive (or thinking) symptoms disease (1). These drugs help people remember small things help people perform little better daily activities, disease continues progress. Medical studies benefits AD drugs wear months; hardly studies examined drugs longer year (1). Persons AD respond drugs differently. A drug treats symptoms person work person. Doctors prescribe AD drugs finding works particular patient. Currently, AD drugs cost $5.00 Cdn day (2). Since drugs cure disease benefits wear time, public private health insurers limit coverage persons meet certain conditions. For example, prescribed donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine, persons mild moderate AD. Also, coverage stop fixed period, person’s symptoms changed check up. Without insurance coverage, persons AD families pay drugs. This financially straining people AD retired fixed incomes. Spouses fixed incomes children financial obligations own. Provincial governments responsible health care Canada. They spend average 38% budgets health care (3). Within sector, provinces pay workers’ salaries, fund hospitals, cover medical procedures, reimburse cost drugs hundreds diseases. If healthcare budget increases, governments reduce provision goods services areas education public transit. Or, governments borrow money raise taxes. The provinces consider spend money AD drugs instead treatments diseases. Ultimately, AD drugs treat symptoms only, cure disease, work patient, wear time. Other treatments, including drugs surgeries, effective treating equally devastating diseases. Faced limits money available spend, provinces difficult choices chosen restrict coverage AD drugs. The impact medications health care general smaller impact treatments diseases. While governments balance competing demands limited budgets, groups different priorities. Pharmaceutical companies, advocacy groups, patients, patients’ families argue expanded AD drug coverage. Pharmaceutical companies sponsored large AD drug trials. They favourable ‘spin’ results trials, benefits drugs small non-existent (4). Pharmaceutical companies urge provinces pay AD drugs. Public insurance coverage generates prescriptions, leads increased sales market share companies.\\\\nAdvocacy groups, Alzheimer’s Society Canada Alzheimer’s Association United States, exist help persons AD. These people want improved access AD drugs, advocacy groups argue better drug coverage. The impact AD profoundly felt spouses, children, relatives, friends persons AD. These people witness AD slowly strips away essence loved ones’ being. Often motivated love sympathy, relatives friends seek treatment, matter good bad, hope help loved ‘get well’. Any drug seen better option nothing, chance lasting change small. One need search Internet vast number complementary treatments claim (despite lack solid medical evidence) help cure AD. Although millions dollars spent AD research year, scientists understand causes AD. This absence knowledge hampered development effective drugs. Optimistic predictions suggest wait years new classes drugs target disease process, symptoms alone, available (5).\\'] [\"A growing number Canadians live multiple chronic health conditions (sometimes referred multi-morbidity).

However, risk effects increases greater number medications, increasing age. A recent conducted systematic review showed adverse effects medications occur 58% people medications (1). Older adults especially susceptible adverse effects medications. For example, medications cause problems memory brain functions (called cognitive impairment), urinary incontinence, impaired balance. This research shows consequences increase risk falls older adult (1). Polypharmacy associated difficulty remembering medications regular basis (1). There important things need understand bodies taking type medication. The thing bodies affect medications– pharmacokinetics. The second thing medications affect bodies – called pharmacodynamics. Both processes keys understanding benefits harms polypharmacy. We consider basic processes age. One important concerns taking multiple medications risk interactions. Medications cause interactions ways. \\\\xa0When combined, medications increase overall effect body. For example, aspirin warfarin (a medicine prevent blood clots) canincreasethe risk bleeding. When together, combined effects aspirin warfarin increase risk bleeding. \\\\xa0In contrast, certain medications, combined,decreasethe overall effect medication. For example, taking antacid time antibiotic, reduces body\\\\\\'s ability absorb antibiotic; interaction reduces effects antibiotic. \\\\xa0So, medications combined, produce “new effect” interaction helpful harmful. Every time medication, bodies series steps process drug, like way digest food. This process known aspharmacokinetic. There different types pharmacokinetic processes described below: Thesepharmacokineticprocesses serve raise lower amounts drug available exert effect body. Interactions occur drug affects processes, changes available drug. As age, changes normally occur thesepharmacokineticprocesses affect risk/benefit profile medications. This causes older adults vulnerable medication-related problems. For example, kidneys work age; reduces ability body eliminate certain medications systems (1;2). A medication prescribed young person different effect person ages. This makes necessary review need for, dose of, medication regular intervals. Our bodies affect medication benefits harms changed. \\\\xa0What drug bodies called \"pharmacodynamics\". Most importantly, medications affect condition prescribed (e.g. lowering blood pressure blood sugar) key.Pharmacodynamiceffects cause medication interactions. When drugs combined cancel out, cause drugs benefit. On hand, drugs combined increase effect both, result greater effect effects (2;3). Drugs interact food, vitamins herbal products.

There are, however, older people feel lonely – Canadians aged 65 older indicated felt lonely time recent study (1). The proportion higher 85 years older – 25% individuals age bracket felt lonely time (1). Loneliness distressing feeling social relationships contact people. Researchers strong point loneliness social isolation; social isolation mean people interact with. Consider people small social network. Both people family neighbor stops visit while. Researchers note people feel lonely, person not. On hand, person large family lives close by, feel lonely; example feel lonely crowd. Loneliness think perceive situation. Also, loneliness depression; lonely people depressed, depressed. However, loneliness lead depression. We don’t exactly understand like chicken egg parable; certain came first. Research shows loneliness number implications people’s health. For example, older people lonely likely experience decline mobility, compared lonely (2). Older people lonely increased risk dying sooner (3). Cacioppo (4), prominent expert field, likens loneliness social pain; like physical pain hurts. But loneliness serve motivational force change connection one’s social relationships. If loneliness having people interact with, causes it? One theory (5) loneliness comes negative wrong (called maladaptive) thoughts oneself others. People believe lonely likely believe people reject them. They likely low self-worth. If loneliness comes negative wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions), different ways better (called interventions) presumably focus changing perceptions. That exactly tried research studies. For example, participants intervention study took workshop. This workshop focused, things, identifying positive relationships past, apply positive aspects past relationships present relationships, gaining awareness personal accomplishments. In review study(5), researchers looked 50 studies wide range things help loneliness (called interventions). Some studies designed change negative wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions). Some studies looked interventions focusing enhancing social supports (for example, linking community groups). This review showed interventions focused changing people’s negative wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions) effective types interventions. Many older adults lonely. Reducing loneliness requires understanding person’s circumstances. Is person lonely socially isolated doesn’t anybody interact with? If so, solution connect people; programs available serve goal, easily community senior centres. But maybe problem lack social connections, way person thinks people. In case, research suggests focus needs changing negative perceptions.\\'] [\"Delirium, called acute confusional state, common potentially condition. It affects older people illnesses (such infections), hospitalization, surgery. It result longer hospital stays associated complications (such increased risk nursing home admission). Delirium syndrome temporarily affects person\\'s thinking. It interferes ability focus, stay track shift attention.\\\\xa0 The symptoms wax wane day, disturb sleep. Confusion, forgetfulness, hallucinations (seeing things real) feeling restless common (1;2). You experience visiting family member friend surgery, themselves.\\\\xa0 Perhaps didn’t remember hospital. They appeared muddled said strange things. These symptoms suggest delirium. [For alternative definition DSM-5 text (3).] There causes delirium, complicated. Scientific research identifies factors delirium likely occur. These important factors grouped main categories: predisposing precipitating factors.Predisposingfactors conditions exist patient delirium develops.Precipitatingfactors conditions associated start delirium. Predisposingfactors include (2): Precipitatingfactors include (2): There types delirium. “Hyperactive” usually obvious person restless, confused acting character. With “hypoactive” type person appear quiet peaceful. It hard detect delirium, clinical test used. The widely studied test Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (4). This takes 5 minutes complete, able detect 90% people delirium; test negative nearly 90% people delirium. These results accurate test. The scientific research completely clear best way help people delirium better.\\\\xa0 Doctors generally believe treating precipitating problem (for example, pneumonia dehydration) help delirium improve quickly. There number simple things help (5): When look research, studies clocks calendars help orient patients. One study clocks calendars added specific talking patient (e.g. reorienting time day activities). On basis experience, National Institute Health Clinical Excellence group emphasized importance family friends helping patient reorientation (5).If person “disorientated” (they don’t know are) important note this; disoriented mean person underlying cognitive impairment dementia. There studies look use drugs help people agitated experiencing delirium. The science clear doctors choose use medications help. Without conclusive evidence, antipsychotic drugs calm people delirious highly agitated, aggressive risk (6;7), butuse types drugs recommended. The exception delirium result alcohol withdrawal, case drugs (benzodiazepines) preferred medications. As causes delirium multiple, effective ways preventing delirium involve multiple strategies. The scientific evidence conclusive, shows encouraging results.\\\\xa0 One trend use multi-component strategies moderate success delirium prevention (8;9;10;11).The types treatments varied widely studies evaluated programs. This makes difficult determine parts multi-component strategies effective. One multi-component program called Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) evaluated studies. This program typically consists 6 components: In 3 studies, HELP program shown reduce frequently people develop delirium hospital 40% (12). These studies good start, future need conclusive studies, (such randomized clinical trials) determine approach best. An approach prevent delirium surgery involved asking geriatrician (a specialist care older people) visit examine patients operations (for example, repair hip fracture). The geriatrician targeted recommendations based structured protocol. In study proactive geriatric consultation, risk delirium surgery reduced (8).\\\\xa0However, study conclusive, air-tight studies required confirm results. Other interventions tried, including music therapy educating health care staff. For scientific evidence weak, studies supporting (13). A recent study though, scientific problems, suggests large positive effect reducing development delirium hospital. This randomized controlled trial showed family members reduce risk person developing delirium 50% (14).This clinical trial involved following: The scientific evidence interventions prevent delirium conclusive. However, strategies simple inexpensive implement.\"] [\\'Human beings social animals. We live others, support other; that’s given evolutionary advantage. So happens person doesn’t – socially isolated? Older people especially risk socially isolated. By time people reach eighties, majority live own, widowhood. This particularly case older women likely widowed older men. Older people’s social networks smaller reasons – children moved away, grandchildren, aging siblings friends died. For decades, researchers interested social isolation impacts people’s health. One question looked people social relationships supportive relationships live longer fewer supportive ones. In studies, people asked social relationships point time; years later, researchers follow determine alive died meantime. In study (1) researchers reviewed 148 studies previously looked social relationships mortality. Across 148 studies, people better social relationships lived longer. Other research looked kinds social activities people participate health effects them. For example, large conducted study (2), people asked social activities engaged in, like visiting relatives friends participating groups senior centres. They asked disabilities. About 5 years later, people interviewed asked disabilities. From this, researchers able determine disabled interview. The researchers socially engaged people likely disabled (43% likely), taking important factors account, physical activity. We need somewhat careful interpreting findings, though, possible factors play. People socially isolated different ways social isolation; example, genetically, behavior, way. Researchers try possible factors account studies, can’t factors account. This means can’t social isolation cause health problems; it’s risk factor increases likelihood experiencing health problems. The research evidence clear reduce social isolation. The obvious answer people connected programs available try that. For example, clubs senior centres allow people together. We lack good evidence, though, shows programs fact reduce social isolation and, ultimately, produce health benefits. We don’t know reach risk socially isolated. If people don’t come forward challenge identify socially isolated help socially engaged. Many older adults socially isolated. This concern us, family members, caregivers, service providers, neighbours. We need watch older people live alone, hardly house, hardly visitors. Making phone visiting family member checking neighbour doesn’t time, big difference somebody’s life. Communication internet makes increasingly easy stay touch geographic distances. And organizations provide opportunities social engagement, senior centres. Service providers aware opportunities refer clients socially isolated them.\\'] [\\'At recent visit doctor, mentioned “M” word. I went new health problem. This medical problems included arthritis hips, heart problems, bladder issues. That’s doctor talked “multimorbidity”. I wasn’t sure “M” word meant, doctor worried, wanted talk pharmacist asked come visit week. I discovered “M” word means living chronic diseases. I certainly fit category lot seniors older Canadians. Living multiple chronic conditions (also means “multimorbidity”) affects growing number people. Across country, approximately 29% Canadians living chronic condition 15% chronic conditions, 7% chronic conditions. However, living “M” likely affect older people. For example, Ontario, 43% adults age 65 chronic conditions (1). Living “M” create challenges yourself, family friends. For example, chronic conditions involve seeing different specialists, prescribing 2 different medications, total number soon adds up. Sometimes help family friends needed sure different doctors’ appointments. It makes hard family doctor care people “M”. Many care guidelines managing chronic diseases don’t consider people single medical problem. \\\\xa0It difficult doctor changes care specialists health professionals involved. A recent evidence brief (2) looked “M” problem described older adults experience. Overall evidence brief showed “M” complicated issue tricky thing study. Some problems involve people “M”, family doctor, healthcare system. In people “M”, significant impact quality life (2). The scientific evidence clear important risk factors people “M”. As pointed recent evidence brief , evidence suggest people living “M” likely die early (3), experience poor clinical outcomes (4), poorer quality life (5), experience loss physical functioning (6;7;8), difficulty getting keeping employment (9). Twosystematic reviews(4;10) compared studies included combinations things help people living community “M”. Although studies difficult compare (so different problems interventions) promising things help prevent problems. The studies focused making changes particular risk factors (for example, things risk falls) making changes improve activities daily living (for example, physiotherapy), tended helpful overall. We don’t scientific evidence yet, building stronger social network (friends, family, etc.) protective effect (11). In people “M”, significant impact quality life (2), means hard to: The “M” problem costs healthcare systems great deal money resources, gained policymakers. Even small percent people (7%) 3 health conditions, big financial impact health system. One study high-needs users health Ontario showed 1% population accounted 33% Ontario’s healthcare costs 5% population cost 66% expenses (12). As age, problem multimorbidity growing concern people 3 different chronic medical conditions. Living health conditions complicated person health issues healthcare providers.
