Staying relevant, me, means feeling connected generations news world position help meaningful way. It means I live life manner bestows value it. I want matter I occupy space planet.Doesn’t want that?

After all, I’m good health financially comfortable, people age can’t same. But problem prepare retirement, bulk planning focuses factors — health wealth — little thought given emotional adjustment required step playing field sidelines.I fear I left relevance field. I apparently this. A Transamerica retirement study 2017 97 percent retirees said happy said strong sense purpose. And, nutshell, that’s what’s missing mine.Let’s face it: Only diehards want play golf fishing day. Sure, it’s nice free daily grind constant exhausting effort took juggle family work. No, I miss rat race. Volunteering, I’m told, isn’t bad route satisfies itch. Sure, involved communities: work elected officials share agendas, deliver meals cheerful banter shut-ins, join ranks read children, walk shelter dogs clean beaches hiking trails slobs leave mess.But impatient things and/or don’t want small cog big wheel. (And personally speaking, I meet charity-thrift-store volunteer wasn’t primarily dibs good donated stuff.)Without question, world needs improvement — I. My pledge new year hole life retirement created. Anyone stay busy, stay relevant. I’m going stick writing difference dusted old book proposal hope finding agent. And clearly, it’s minute soon: Sadly, plant died. The time I went physical therapy, try delay need hip replacement, attractive 40-something therapist I’ll Maria worked me. I seen twice week weeks. That day I client time slot, therapists disappeared, alone. Toward end session, told finish weight machine 25 feet away. After wiped table I on, model-like 30-something body-sculpting workout outfit walked lay table.As I started weights, began talking man Maria met recently. It wasn’t I eavesdropping; I couldn’t help overhearing. At appointment told husband died years earlier, subsequent visits talked mundane things — difficulty raising young children alone, mother helping, fun boys recent vacation Florida. We talked like dating; I didn’t want pry.After minutes, women’s voices dropped whisper, I realized shock didn’t want turn conversation taken. There thing discussing; I strongly doubted new recipe avocado toast. I’m 71 married, I can’t remember incident younger women rude. What thinking? That I disapprove? That creepy let older hear sex talk? Forget judging them, judging me. If I thought talking subject I’d dismiss general rudeness. But uber-rudeness because, course, dealt stereotypes women’s age sex lives.I completed number reps Maria assigned me, picked sweatshirt left. I thought walking table, leaning saying, “Just wanted know — I remember lust.” I hoping embarrass them, I don\\'t know caught sarcasm. Instead I let drop. This appointment.Although majority commercials pitching exercise equipment feature sexy young females difficult women 40 espouse joys sex. Joan Price, 76, member national writers groups, makes living writing seniors sex. Her book subject, written age 61, Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After SixtyHow pivoted writing health fitness story itself. Joan met man 57, married 62 experienced intense love passion died years later. She went write books joys sex men women later life describes website “an advocate ageless sexuality.”Many older women, like Price, long, fulfilling sex life don’t talk it. There women sex painful certain age, sex drive drops cliff. I’ve talked both; helped doctors, not. Then Jane Fonda like her. Two years ago, 80, told syndicated TV news magazine Extra “closed shop there.”The thing is, we’ve different experiences, different needs desires. No woman stereotyped sexuality age, especially younger women. Sometimes best intentions don’t turn well. With mind, we’d like eradicate popularly phrases demean older people meant compliments.“You look great!”On surface, certainly appears compliment. But scratch surface lies (twofold) problem. Under fold speaker bite tongue stop adding “for age.” Many older people hear it’s unspoken. And fold two: Who says “great” anymore? Certainly self-respecting millennial. “Great” second cousin twice removed “sexy,” “hot” “amazing.” Thanks, descriptors instead, please.“You don’t look 65!”First, logic: If I’m 65, 65 looks like. Makes sense, no?The problem lies speaker’s perception — young good and, conversely, old bad. So tells don’t look age, complimenting defying aging process. But ways flatter recognizing accomplishments — acknowledging born genes don’t produce wrinkles isn’t them.Plus, state obvious, living grows older day. And that’s good thing, considering alternative. In fact, things better age — fine wine. Studies shown thatsex improves grow older. Chalk practice experience!“My grandma adorable.”Yeah, she’s darling can’t resist demeaning her, huh? “Adorable” term best applied puppies babies. When older, infantilizes person. It’s time lose “adorable,” “cute,” maybe stick language shows respect.Ageism occurs stop defining people individuals view terms age. Older people frequently seen incompetent, infantilizing fuels idea actually are.And breaking bad habits here, maybe quit posting “funny” things like mom hasn’t caught LOL doesn’t mean lots love. The notion older people aren’t internet savvy bogus little outdated. They born device hand early adapters digitally managed life, caught technology degree. Older people regularly shop bank online, use social media platforms rely devices work, entertainment communications. When mock mistakes public forums, it’s hurtful, amusing.So post mom’s goof, remember, likely photo 2-year-old naked bathtub, know attach email.“Can I help you, young lady?”Once again, speaking woman clearly older, think compliment. But reference age all? You reinforcing cultural value young good old bad assuming calling young lady flatter her. It won’t. Take woman’s order, ask help, job. Would million years ask teenager, “Want freshly grated Parmesan cheese, old woman?” Of course not. So don’t here.This hard believe, times history elders actually venerated. They held powerful positions family community knowledge wisdom. The industrial revolution changed that, mobility increased younger people moved extended family circle pursuit jobs. As elders’ roles diminished, older people regarded society.So “young lady,” please. No “old-timer,” either. No “humorous” birthday cards expressing regrets year older.

When people think age discrimination, usually envision workers fired, denied promotions hired simply age.But it’s livelihood stake, professional identity self-worth? What bullied, miserable feel threatened remarks actions job focus age?Liz DiMarco Weinmann tell you. She 50s, working Washington, D.C., public affairs company when, meeting important — younger — client, briefly forgot spokesperson. “This man started swearing cursing saying, ‘I sick tired having young staff knows what’s going on,’ I senile,” recalls. “He took papers hands threw room.”When Weinmann reported episode manager, boss compounded outrage telling company lost account, it’d couldn’t remember things. “It totally despicable,” recalls. “That experience closest I’ve come thinking I roll work again.”Age harassment, deliberately inadvertently hurtful language, bit illegal forms age discrimination. Yet verbal harassment isn’t taken seriously. And particularly difficult justice legal harassed.“If come home say, ‘I’ve accused calling ‘old fart,’ bats eye,” says Michael Borrelli, employment attorney Borrelli & Associates New York. “Older people forgotten group cares about. As far standing society, totally discounted.”Donna Ballman, employment attorney Fort Lauderdale, Florida, agrees. “Older people getting targeted lot” hostile, inappropriate language, notes.The data supports that. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said recent report age-based harassment claims tripled 1992 2017. A national survey 3,900 workers AARP Research 2018 nearly1 person 4 heard boss colleague negative age-based remark them.Weinmann, 67, returned New York incident Washington got advanced business degree. She owns consulting practice advocates older workers. That includes talking MBA alumni New York University age harassment expect face older. The language ageism “pervasive” business, says. “People think certain age, you’re important.” ADEA Federal Laws Part reason age-biased language pervasive employers train workers view negative age-based remarks seriously target race, gender sexual orientation.But telling roadblocks seeking justice. While federal law says “it unlawful harass person age,” law limits damages victims seek federal court things like pay. In words, federal court case, can’t compensated mental anguish caused verbal harassment, employer can’t forced pay punitive damages, matter blatant abuse. That’s different federal laws covering discrimination based race, gender, sex disability, allow compensatory and/or punitive damages.AARP Foundation lawyer Laurie McCann recalls case older worker’s desk taken away force quit retire younger colleagues seated. “The older worker standing office desk, monetary damages federal law? None,” says. “But suffered harassment.”AARP organizations pushed change federal Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA) allow compensatory punitive damages, McCann says, “we’re seeing progress.”One effective way win age-based harassment case federal level prove employer intentionally created work environment harassment severe, hostile pervasive cause reasonable person quit, McCann says. In legal terms, that’s called “constructive discharge”; case meets standard, sue lost wages.An example case filed assistance ofAARP Foundation attorneys Ohio State University. Two instructors, 64 68, College Education Human Ecology, alleged “an ongoing unchecked pattern harassing conduct” supervisor, included calling older workers “millstones” “deadwood.” That created “working conditions intolerable reasonable employee circumstances compelled resign,” women said EEOC complaint. Eventually, women’s jobs eliminated forced retire. The EEOC women faced “intentional age discrimination” workplace. Facing potentially embarrassing legal battle, university settled women $765,000 2018, gave jobs committed conduct training sessions prevent bias.Still, wins rare. Consider recent decisions: In 2013 case William Bennis v. Minnesota Hockey Ventures Group, then-57-year-old Bennis said felt treated poorly age, citing comments supervisor as, “your eyes worse older” told didn’t need job younger employee. A federal district court ruled Bennis hadn’t shown hostile workplace.Debra Fletcher, 58, sued Gulfside Casino 2011, saying harassed comments asked needed hearing aid glasses, Geritol, coworkers bringing phrase “Seniors Day” her. A federal district court ruled comments minor “of level constitute age harassment.”Charles Denver Baker sued Becton, Dickinson Co. 2010, saying called old slow, told lacked energy enthusiasm, informed supervisor didn’t want 40 sales staff. Baker 61 sued. But failed convince federal court workplace environment hostile. He appealed, died age 68. When Robin Shea, attorney Constangy, Brooks, Smith Prophete turned 40, younger coworkers draped black crepe paper office left cardboard tombstone. She thought funny she’s age 60, longer finds humor age-related jokes. “Because threat real,” says. State Age Discrimination Laws Vary It financially rewarding pursue age harassment claim states federal court. Some states, like Hawaii Illinois, allow age harassment suits permit awarding compensatory punitive damages. But state age-bias laws vary widely. South Dakota, example, state age discrimination law all.Even states generous laws harassing workers, court battle long costly, viewed resort, experts say. But doesn’t mean harassment tolerated.“I anybody subject harassment should, least, talk manager — assuming manager wasn’t it. If are, HR department,” McCann says. “And refuse address behavior, victim consider filing charge discrimination EEOC. It’s wrong shouldn’t happen.” Older people forgotten group cares about. As far standing society, totally discounted.MICHAEL BORRELLI, employment attorney Borrelli & Associates Employment attorney Ballman advises employees document harassing conduct: Note you’re treated differently younger employees, write age-related comments, report behavior human resources department, preferably writing. Those steps satisfy U.S. Supreme Court decision requires: report discriminatory harassment employer chance remedy it.If harassment continues, step consult attorney file complaint EEOC and/or state’s human relations commission. (Find state human relations commissions atiaohra.org/PublicInformation.) The resort, situation remains unresolved mediation, file lawsuit employer, Ballman says.There lots reasons people endure harassment. Some employees fear retaliation complain supervisor’s peer’s conduct. They ashamed internalized idea maybe old, says Brian Heller, partner Manhattan law firm Schwartz Perry & Heller.But reporting age harassment carries consequences. “There’s cost coming forward,” Heller says. “You’ve got live taking action response it. That cause additional scars people suffer harassment.”John Rosengren, author books, written 100 publications. No doubt remember learned iron high school science class.

And and?Having kids later life definitely advantages — we\\'re wiser, we\\'ve lot stuff youth — flip side, time energy running out. How manage managed right kids’ future, right financial physical well-being?Here key areas consider.1. Retirement vs. collegeTwo epic investments loom heads: retirement kids’ education.Amber Miller, senior financial planner Planning Center Minneapolis, points that, contrary popular misconception, expenses don\\'t retirement; change. And can\\'t loan retirement. “There loans mortgages, loans college, we\\'re focusing retirement, we\\'ll there,” says. The retirement/college conundrum going complex, future cost education unknowns. More often, Miller sees clients ask kids foot bill: “The older idea parents pay college, parents teaching kids skin game.\"This philosophy Kari Brych (49) husband, Jim (54), kids, ages 8 6. They started saving kids’ college education year following adoption, aren\\'t overly concerned aboutpaying college. They paid education (they work health care), they\\'ll help kids costs, “I\\'m sure we\\'ll foot complete bill,” Brych says. “We want sense ownership work ethic instead entitlement, balance.” They\\'ve prioritized funding retirement, they\\'ll accomplish having worked hours having kids, living means.Our financial adviser told thing: There\\'s deadline save retirement, it\\'s coming. Best save now.2. Invite everybody discussionFor some, money intensely private, matter discussed anyone. But money emotional personal, Miller says, talking kids great opportunity teach valuable people family. Sharing choices we\\'re making — age-appropriate ways — mentor fiscal responsibility. She works clients invite minor-aged children financial conversations. “The cross-generational conversations, satisfying results we\\'ll have,” says. And bonus: She\\'s seen 16-year-old kids started IRA job.3. Health insurance costsThere\\'shealth insuranceto consider — kids. The 50s prime decade purchase long-term care insurance; age, we\\'re paying premiums long, 50s, gets prohibitively expensive buy. This conversation add pillow talk: Do resources pay growing health care costs? “Not like solution everyone,” Miller says, it\\'s question consider.Health insurance play role long continue work, especially kids cover. “We working past retirement capacity,” says Brych, “if health care insurance.” Because husband work medical field, work reduced hours benefits. “If continues, consider it, we\\'ll young kids we\\'ll want it.”4. Taking care — nowAnd there\\'s present moment consider.Five years ago I sat couch nursing infant, 4-year-old 2-year-old racing us, I literally feel muscle mass disappearing.

Mark I want able kids, energy level inspires stay game.“One big concerns staying healthy,” says Brych. “For us, maintaining healthy lifestyle paramount. Some things can\\'t change, like genetics. But things mitigate age healthy fashion.” They stay active biking, skiing hiking, individually family. “I owe children that,” says. “They didn\\'t choose adopted old parents.\" I 61.

According The Study Women’s Health Across Nation (SWAN), sleep disturbances range 16 42 percent premenopausal women climb 35 60 percent we’re postmenopausal. These sleep difficulties postmenopause run gamut — problems falling asleep, staying asleep, waking early feeling rested. Insomnia wreak havoc lives, causing problems memory increased risk cardiovascular disease, greater anxiety irritability, lower quality life.However, good news doesn’t way, In fact, “There recent data sleeping older, sign health status sleep status,” according Breus, speaking master class, “Why Am I So Exhausted?

The reason women’s postmenopausal sleep problems include, large part, fact estrogen progesterone hit rock menopause, ratio hormones testosterone thrown balance, says Abhinav Singh, M.D. medical director Indiana Sleep Center. This imbalance reasons thatsleep apnea(a sleep disorder breathing stops starts), tends common postmenopause, closer prevalence men.This time snoring weight tend increase.Hot flashes(or sudden intense heat upper body) andnight sweats(the ones occur night) linked insomnia age.

Do 20 minutes cardio day, avoid vigorous exercise late day. Eat time day. And cut coffee alcohol! If drink coffee, stop 2 p.m.Prepare bed. This Singh refers sleep 4-play.

So instead freaking tired day, use positive self-talk. For example, ask yourself, “What best friend I love say? “You’ll sleep. Millions people world struggle this.”Start morning right. “If I tip, wake time single day,” Breus says. He recommends deep breaths wake respiratory system, 20 30 ounces room temperature water sit up, sleep dehydrating. Then “get light eyeballs.” Ideally, getting outside sunlight optimal, it’s dark outside, artificial light (such light box) help rid brain fog. Also, blood tests check deficient iniron, magnesium, Vitamin Dormelatonin.Finally, Singh suggests minimizing use sleep aids (over counter prescription) favor behavioral cognitive approaches improving sleep. “Making changes prepare think sleep best approach long term,” says.

Author son pose surfboard.Alandra Porrazzo, Island Dream Production At high noon, headed beachfront surf club, new classmates included elementary school-age kids, Tanner teenagers. As practiced surfing sand, kids caught immediately.

For information, tokristanhiggins.com. Who knew we’d actually nostalgic sex ed classes? Sure, awkward, literally schooled ABCs surrounding hormonal cycles. Decades later, we’re seemingly square one, wondering bodies moods started betray us. And judging reaction loved ones, we’re ones impacted changes.Make mistake: The confusion frustration perimenopause menopause real. “Women dark symptoms aren’t understood,” says Sara Gottfried, San Francisco-based gynecologist best-selling author. (Her latest book,Brain Body Diet, released March 5). “When we’re younger, think menopause cliff drop turn 50. The truth is, there’s long preparation bodies final menstrual cycle.”To more, Gottfried answered our, uh, burning questions.What happening inside?Five hormones flux perimenopause: estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, thyroid testosterone (factor insulin leptin weight gain). Perimenopause — years hormonal upheaval final menstrual period — begins dropping progesterone levels ends dropping estrogen. During phase perimenopause woman runs ripe eggs “the hallmark shorter cycles heavier bleeding,” Gottfried says. The second phase defined lower estrogen skipped cycles. Despite perception there’s continuous decline estrogen en route menopause, “it fluctuate wildly,” notes. In fact, excess estrogen reason women experience breast discomfort.For sake loves ones, I handle moodiness?Remember raged parents teen? During perimenopause, partner and/or children public enemies. That’s heightened PMS symptoms estrogen (read: irritability, anxiety, depression) rising stress levels cortisol. Even disheartening, old methods coping — glass wine chocolate — won’t help alcohol caffeine raise cortisol levels disrupt sleep . . . leading stress. Gottfried recommends prioritizing deep sleep. “You need minimum 90 minutes night [of deep sleep] brain gets refreshed reduce anxiety depression,” says. Devices Fitbit Versa help track zzz\\'s.How long mood swings last?Good news: Menopause resolve moodiness. Bad news: The path menopause decade. But regular exercise reverse trend estrogen dominance, help mood stress. Foods fatty acid phosphatidylserine, soy beans, carrots cabbage, improve mood. Most important? “Having honest discussion spouse children you’re experiencing nurture understanding,” says. “It’s especially important talk partner lower libido help restore loving relationship.”Ugh, I stained sheets. Why bleeding heavy stop?The excessive — annoyingly constant — bleeding estrogen dominance, fibroids endometriosis. And diet changes, exercise supplements deter symptoms, Gottfried advises women tread carefully talk doctor peace mind. “Anyone bleeding occurs frequently 21 days, heavy bleeding soaking pad tampon hours bleeding persists seven days longer seek medical attention,” cautions.What I hot flashes?Once again, hormones blame. “The accompanying changes hormones switch occurs menstrual cycle symptoms like hot flashes worse,” Gottfried says. They’re especially noticeable week leading period decline progesterone. To help reduce intensity feeling like you’re sauna, try paced respiration: Breathe deeply 20 minutes twice day five-second inhale, 10-second hold five-second exhale.Will skin look dewy again?The problem estrogen. Its reduction menopause decreases moisture content skin elasticity, leading increase inwrinkling sagging, sigh. Lowered estrogen adds decrease skin collagen well. But hope lost! “You slow skin-aging process encouraging collagen flourish body,” says Gottfried. For starters, instead a.m. caffeine fix, try collagen latte: 1 cup decaffeinated coffee tea, 1-2 tablespoons collagen powder 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Blend frothy!Name positive road menopause. Go.As stop juggling fluctuating hormones, “I believe perimenopause menopause end accommodation women taught do,” Gottfried notes. That means speaking truth stopping need feel responsible happiness others. Besides, “So age care health,” adds. “If steps balance hormones eat, sleep, think, menopause represent start new phase life end one.” That’s better. The 2020 school closings openings 1953 grade life-changing experience.At dentist’s office checkup, I saw picture cute, smiling daughter, Sally. He said start grade PS #66 Mrs. Miller’s class. Fearful sitting desk day — knowing kindergarten classmates, any, — I rejoiced.Arriving early recognizing Sally appeared, I motioned desk I saved mine. “Are Dr. Berman’s little girl?”She smiled easily, maybe wanted meet me, possibly calling little girl amused her. We laughed Mrs. Miller said. We ones. At recess went playground together, virtually years, identical clothing — including blue white middy blouses black pedal pushers perform “Side Side” charity carnival house.Our classmates labeled “the twins.”I knew exactly alike. Relatives unrelated grownups called Sally “cute” “pretty” “good math.” I swallowedthat.I loved performances, imaginary worlds, made-up words mischief. The day Mary Martin flew television screens Peter Pan, Sally I dragged family’s housekeeper rec room, stood expensive chair attached rope ceiling, tying end waist. She fly. The chair broke unfixable.At day camp, I overheard male counselor tell Sally adorable. I pushed “little adorable” lake. By accident, I claimed. At age 11, came overnight camp, boys ignored suddenly surrounded night, wanting meet friend. My friend. What possessed share My Camp? Why, home, boys dancing school race floor Sally?Our distance widened high school, boys flocked carry books I lots books carry, cheerleader loved partying. I neither. In college, New York City I fit. Sally Hare Krishna. Her boyfriend husband Krishna leader.“The music’s pretty. No meat fine, sex?” father said. “Imagine others’ rules governing life.”I couldn’t. Not communal living, either. At age 38, Sally abandoned orange robe. Divorced, Krishna, exuding warmth eager — I, visited. We picked pieces, all. As divorced single mother, teacher, writer, veteran psychotherapy happy life I created, I felt older. It irked dallied dressing out, seemingly unaware time waiting. It irked me, too, wanted attend class understand refusal confidentiality trust students, personal writing struggles shared. But reminiscing, giggling mainly mincing words feel close her. Bonded.After brief time unattached, Sally dated Ben, loved camp. She moved Portland home children married him. When I mentioned I visit college roommate, Helen, Portland yearly, said, “Stay me.”“No. We’ll play.” I reminded dawdled, I wanted meals reasonable hour. Sally wore diamond stud earrings looked put-together family dinner Helen’s. We performed “Side Side,” laughed things funny.“Mom talks great times together,” daughter said. “You bring other’s spirit.”Years later, Portland bookstore event bookWriting Personal Experience, Sally — asking — plopped table. Huh? “Go sit audience.”“I’ve known forever. I here,” said. I told quiet presentation, help sell book. She did. And I repeats story. And gap looks longer existing. Or eyes.In New York friend’s 50th birthday bash, Sally stayed listened I rehearsed speech I nervous give. Walking Park Avenue party backward like walk PS #66, sitting seeing Sally smile I spoke feel home.When father died, I called Sally right away. Her Krishna belief afterlife comforted me. So late-night reminders “he’s better place” — knowing challenges faced cognitively impaired mother. I asked help clean father’s Florida closet, arranging time mother’s nearby.When finished, accompanied nursing home mother. “Remember me?” Sally asked, bending wheelchair long, warm hug. “Remember you?” Mom said. “You play together.” We do. We do. Grandparents considered family’s source wisdom. Most learned lot years hard work, particularly parenting department. Raising kids adulthood quick easy accomplishment, it’s natural grandparents feel expertise impart subject child-rearing. Yet times changed, parenting styles techniques today ineffective strict enough. Grandparents want share ideas parenting, particularly area concern child’s behavior well-being. But cost getting involved grandkids brought up. Nobody enjoys family tensions divisions. Is “right” way time parenting advice avoid family conflict?Before discussing parenting adult kids, grandparents need reflect reasons so.“As long children safe (no physical emotional abuse), it\\'s individual parents decide what\\'s best children,” explains Nicole Arzt, licensed marriage family therapist Fullerton, California. “Seniors need remind aren’t children. This hard; all, want help. Constantly bringing disagree things differently create resentment adult children them. It impact relationship grandchildren.” (Obviously physical emotional abuse dealt professionals trained help protect children.) Arzt raises interesting question, though. Is helpful versus overstepping boundaries? Perhaps there’s grandparent’s desire weigh in.Leela Magavi, physician regional medical director forCommunity Psychiatrysays, “Disparate parenting styles induce anxiety grandparents, lead feelings isolation sadness. One anxiety-inducing things aging individual experience loss control. It pivotal grandparents maintain identities remain engaged hobbies passions grandparent.”Clearly active lifestyle interests outside children grandkids multiple benefits seniors themselves. Arzt recommends having journal, therapist, friends similar age range, particularly grandparents need grouse kids grandkids likely understand offended. However, grandparents need sensitive needs desires adult children grandkids – specific times input actuallyiswanted needed.Richard C. Horowitz, co-founder ofGrowing Great Relationships, coaching/training practice, author book,“Family Centered Parenting - Your Guide For Growing Great Families”advocates open communication suggests, “If [adult] child complains behavior grandchild, OK say, ‘Would like suggestions me?’”When adult kids voluntarily seek advice, it’s received better suggestion “I worked parent” angle harsh criticism current parental tactics. An occasional request counsel doesn’t mean door permanently open unsolicited opinions, though. Grandparents invited weigh specific topic shared respect that. If grandkids tell grandparents they’re upset parents, it’s better suggest approaches grandchild try work matter parents independently possible. Dangerous situations (like pool gate left unlatched) warrant grandparents speaking up, confirms Horowitz.Paul Greene, psychologist director theManhattan Center Cognitive-Behavioral Therapyin New York, helpful tips grandparents. He advises: Pick battles. If offer nonstop parenting advice, it\\'s likely ignored.Practice acceptance. The reality ability impact kids\\' parenting style point limited. Viewing situation need \"fix\" likely lead unhappiness ends.Offer genuine praise appreciate kids\\' parenting. This help suggestions heard, help overall relationship too. What seniors feel they’re entitled kids grandkids receiving financial benefit them, common current economy?Raffi Bilek, family therapist director atBaltimore Therapy Centersays, “It’s important grandparents recognize control. If providing financial support happy money going (e.g., video games instead school supplies) option sending money. That\\'s control. What children kids control. If you\\'re looking able toinfluencethe situation, come terms fact can\\'tcontrolit.” Influence easily accepted coming positive approach, Bilek counsels.What grandkids grandparents? Who’s charge then? Greene says, “Be fun-loving grandparents are, andbe considerate decisions affect parents. You\\'ll set powerful healthy example grandkids. It\\'s important follow parents\\' rules bedtimes, especially parents ones need deal kids day. It\\'s okay rules kids home, clearly violates wishes parents. You don\\'t want set example defying parents\\' authority. Instead, set healthy example mature negotiation parents it\\'s necessary.”Dianne Grande, psychologist Batavia, Illinois writer Choosing Therapy, urges grandparents, “Let adult children mistakes — like did!”Perfection necessity raise well-rounded compassionate children, says Magavi, seniors easy adult kids trying parent best can. Grandparents simply enjoy grandkids free responsibilities raising them. The kids doubt fantastic young people grandparents adore — parented differently grandparents think — that’s matters most.

And isn’t growing older general tiring enough? Why add it?Unfortunately, well-earned self-acceptance doesn’t happen minute blow wax numbers zero birthday cakes. It took fact people think business. Sometimes, 63, I forget I’m 23 years old — I don’t mean good way.Forty years ago, I caught extremes work, trying viewed promotable able job pink slips started fly. In social circles, I concerned I seen cool, dating realm, I hoping desirable male gaze.In past years, I situations proved toxic I reacted initially I day — is, along.

Now, people worrying they’re going fall favor me.I quit job bow social event I’m uncomfortable, umbrage? Well, there’s saying that’s new, I’m sure, it’s new me: Don’t push away, wonder I went.I longer emotional bandwidth deal avoidable things I let aggravate me. Hence, I begun unfollowing celebrities social media provocative attention’s sake, I trying personal professional relationships misguided loyalty nostalgia, I basing sartorial choices fear comment I spent much/too little, trend unfashionable, sexy, dowdy, casual, etc. (If don’t like I’m wearing, don’t look.)Most all, goal spend remaining decades wasting second formulating “zingers” lob determined tough making aggressive, passive-aggressive, defensive smart-aleck remarks. Instead, I use energy walk away they’ve said didn’t matter — doesn’t.But that’s me. You you. I shocked postmenopausal complacency sex watching vintage episodes ofThe Golden Girls,which aired NBC 1985 1992.That sentence I never, thought I write.Like comedies dramedies,The Golden Girlstackled real-world issues shrouded irony, laughter jokes. I didn’t tune episode, reliable late-night standby, companion double shift restaurant, eating not-so-good frozen pizza, finally able rest.What I didn’t expect I began rewatching series (pandemic binge-watching thing do) sassy character Blanche Devereaux affect me.Played Rue McClanahan, Blanche complicated, somewhat problematic TV character, especially viewed modern lens. She’s proudly plantation-style Southern roots, refers people North Yankees opinions progressive bigoted, difficulty accepting siblings gay. But like Karen Walker fromWill & Grace,Blanche caricature—a judgmental conservative changes beliefs opens heart people different.But Blanche pink flamingo pack gal pals living Miami home—bold, bright beautiful—with assume (allegedly) enviably long frequent orgasms. Where Karen Walker dotes alcohol, Blanche loves sex. She wears eye-catching, flamboyant outfits accentuate body, instead hiding aging status. She unabashedly flirtatious man proud sexually active “older” person. Older quotes Blanche, youngest ladies, estimated be52at show’s inception.I 52. I don’t feel like “old” lady normal live senior citizens sleepy retirement community. But seniors longer expected play bridge shuffleboard. With life expectancy rising, people 50 live active, engaged lives before.Tell libido, began fizzle hell perimenopause. Hot flashes, lack sleep belly weight gain feel sexy.Sex huge identity. Like Blanche, I known flirtatious people genders (I’m pansexual). When I think rich sexual history, I’ve encounters probably Blanche blush. But march menopause snuffed spark.The loss estrogen amazingly cruel things. I’m fatter, grayer, wrinkled. My skin rough places puckering others.

I great delight seeing, corner eye, flash lace piece silk moving rhythmically busy. I clutch handful satin delightfully dirty things partner. I parade (when kid isn’t he’s sleeping) getting nightcap making evening herbal tea, partner’s eyes following step, making feel like getting sweaty him.Sometimes I adopt Southern drawl mimic way Blanche sashays walks. Yes, I’m weird. Fortunately, open-minded, loving life partner weird, he’s it. It’s working us. Get Blanche clothes works you. In darkness, eyes flip open. A sudden alertness brain informs that, inscrutable reasons, body sleep now. Glancing clock, registers depressing 3:12 a.m., I notice husband’s bed empty. Time pre-dawn rendezvous.I pad downstairs bathrobe, pool light living room illuminating way. Sure enough, there’s husband couch, curly hair rumpled, reading glasses perched nose, biography Meriwether Lewis open lap. He looks resignedly. “You, too?” I nod. “Me, too.”For years medical issues marriage tended stay separate. Pregnancy, childbirth odd inconclusive mammogram department. My husband dealt pain, tendonitis bike injury. But funny thing happened hit 50s: Our ailments began aligning. First I got reading glasses, did. We began feeling creakier mornings. And insomnia started.Between us, we’ve tried remedies: staying screens bedtime, avoiding red wine, white noise machine. I recommend all. But don’t work, like tonight, I recommend different approach: staying together. Being awake middle night depressing, doesn’t lonely. And little understanding, grumpy people smile about. Now, I join husband couch, I want complain. I want mutter darkly doctor, tempered sympathy noting matter-of-factly sleeplessness “just tends occur” menopause — half us.The Study Women’s Health Across Nation shows “that prevalence sleep disturbance increases increasing age. The prevalence premenopausal age group ranges 16 percent 42 percent; perimenopausal women prevalence varies 39 percent 47 percent; postmenopausal females, prevalence ranges 35 percent 60 percent.”The rule getting 3 a.m. empathy. My husband clearly awake longer I have, 26 years together, I’ve learned him, talking physical problems exacerbates them.“How hours get?” I ask. It’s question willing answer state sleep.“Four,” says flatly.I hand. “Poor sweetie.”“At I’m trying sleep rain, like guys,” says, gesturing book. He gives hand squeeze. “And I’ve got nice warm wife snuggle with.”Snuggling energy right now, staying together, doesn’t appreciate reminded considers hot stuff?I roll eyes smile him. Pulling quilt us, I thankful year cooped small house, like other. The house quiet, sound faint hum refrigerator.“You know wake much?” husband asks. I know exactly he’s going say, guy trying cheer morning, let shtick.“Tell me.”“You don’t eat cereal.”A bowl cereal bed husband’s cherished evening ritual. Toasty Multi-Grain Squares didn’t avert insomnia tonight, I refrain pointing out. “You’re right. Definitely trying tomorrow.” I laugh elbows mock outrage.Most nights, warm milk honey reading feel sleepy, upstairs manage drift again. But sleep eludes us. I tend trying anyway; husband prefers accept wakeful fate.Now sets book thud, saying “What kind scones want, raspberry blueberry?” Yes, actually bakes scones. Or muffins. Baking insomniac activity. I’m baffled husband’s yen insomniac productivity. I try convincing come bed, we’ve learned importance respecting other’s middle-of-the-night survival tactics. Besides, I complain coping strategy involves baking?I lean sigh. At point I attempt sleep again. If I succeed, I awaken smell warm scones drifting stairs.I’m sleepy bed, though. Not yet. I pull quilt snugly us, remembering husband’s insistence getting night change diapers children babies I snooze bit longer. Later, I wrangled kids 5 long hours weekend fieldwork graduate school. A united deep affection seen middle school drama, teenage shenanigans, isolation sorrow pandemic — now, wakeful nights.Soon I try summon slumber time. For now, I wordlessly rest head husband’s shoulder. As sit pre-dawn quiet, I realize simply sharing sleeplessness retreating irritably separate rooms, husband I unconsciously deepening relationship, time expect to.Take that, insomnia. As child, I loved Grimm’s Fairy Tales, perfect sense. After all, grandma lived little château France.To visit I crossed woods, called La Garenne, trekked ancient farmhouse I spent weekends. From grandeur green darkness, La Garenne transitional space light noise family living room.In beginning, woods static. They old scraggly. Countless family feet left roots rocks exposed, making easy trip. My grandmother Nicole unchanging I little. She short energetic, smelling Chanel No. 5, Olay cream Royale Bleue cigarettes. She wore cashmere sweaters, pearls oversized green rain boots garden walk muddy forest. The story life story woman cared others, warm smile sparkling, playful eyes. Author\\'s grandmother, Nicole Like grandmother, woods wildly familiar secrets. When I 10-year-old carrying wicker basket, grandmother showed look mushrooms hollows foot trees matted leaves — telling leave mushroom grow.In woods, grandmother knew secrets, unlatching concealed compartments heirloom secretary’s desk. Then open hinged box Russian bonds issued czar revolution, ways lost family money.As popular fairy tale, château symbolized romance. It wedding gift great-grandmother, teen, I roamed ivy, walking carefully holly, I I called Sleeping Beauty’s Alley. Often, I went natural arcade overarching trees soft ivy carpet ground green light streaming in.Grandma Nicole playful private. Though grandparents devout Catholics, teen I finally math — father’s birth months wedding. When I asked them, grandfather said, “The Church understood sins flesh.” I joked amazed premature baby’s plump cheeks. I imagined 18-year-old, forced marriage got pregnant, dreaming independent life. Later great-aunt told party future grandparents slept together. They pressured marry proper bourgeois families.A complicated love developed playful grandma grandfather. She stayed marriage, all. I 40-some grandchildren. We experienced grandmother’s kindness, restless energy occasional sharpness. After shouting fit, bed. Of course, queen witch.Like Grandma Nicole, La Garenne easy experience, like summertime, breeze rose late day. At times, I trudged woods downpour, slipping step.My life shaped peace. My grandmother’s youth took place World War II. She looked German soldier eye occupation. She jumped roadside ditches bicycle evade German patrols curfew.Like woods, grandmother deserved attentive respect. I adult great-aunt Alix told Nicole dance dining room table. Who then, joyful unfettered? She experienced Nazi occupation, pilot husband’s absence overseas, joys heartbreaks giving birth 10 children. As time progressed discussed matters faith, choice morality, agreed non-Catholics didn’t hell.By 30s, I knew La Garenne’s secrets, I realized little I truly knew grandmother. I discovered child, servants summoned ringers wall. Then, World War II, family’s fortunes changed. Money, lack it, didn’t bother much. She unbelievably welcoming.Like good fairy, grandmother loved small children. She died years ago, age 86. Her home, Le Château la Morinerie, sale. I walk La Garenne again. Now I middle-aged, I uncovering proverbial roots I emerged. I inherited playfulness, informality love flowers. I strive welcoming was.Though complexity, Nicole remain forever partially known — way tourist drive grand facade La Morinerie, knowing bad plumbing. Yet, grandma indelible, oversized green gardening boots, walking roses. Think moment life, month decades ago. If you’re woman, probably know wearing hair: long short, light dark, curly straight, down. Many organize memoir hairstyles years effort (or not) took maintain them.This isn’t we’re superficial because, like not, hair identity. Unlike aspects identity, however, height, weight, intelligence, avocation, change hairstyles quickly, effecting instant transformation pair scissors, curling iron henna rinse. Or three!When woman movies goes lam, usually applies bottle dye sink rest-stop bathroom, and—presto!—new person. So, hair identity, it’s temporary part. We think hair lot change it. And continuing wish physically attractive (in era age!) means dwell hair. Even isn’t mind, look mirror — — head!And comes hair, usually feel better. The grass greener, shinier, door. In high school, girls straight hair admire waves, I wanted sheet hair fall like theirs. In college, I watched bewilderment Maura long straight hair tried body limp bangs. Limp bangs I craved.In 1969, I went Woodstock festival burn marks arm iron. Yes, I actually laid head ironing board, iron “wool” setting! In years followed, occasional attempts chemical straightening. There bouts blow dryer, touch-ups straightening iron. Everything worked … temporarily, air dry. I asked husband, “How like hair best? Curly straight?” The question fraught. If said “straight,” he’d disparaging natural look; said “curly,” he’d dismissing hours I took making straight! He paused. Then diplomatic genius (send Middle East!), said, “I like wear ways.”About dozen years ago, keratin widely available; stylist calls “the important beauty product 20 years.” It answer dreams. Every months I two-hour treatment salon, I style hair all: hair soft straight. I cut hair short, friend said, “You wearing hair like thatall life.”I stopped thinking hair. Then came COVID-19, keratin grew out. And I began appreciate waves.My 4-year-old granddaughter, bend hair, told solemnly, “I’ve wanted straight hair.” The “always” killed me. So sentiment. I try curl-positive her, scrunching hair wet, explaining, “so dry curly.” She takes in. And popular culture helping accept hair.Although curls said making comeback decade 1970, today curls reign. Never I seen models actresses curly wavy hair! Dead-straight hair (as Rosamund Pike’s hairdo inI Care Lot) starting look … dead. After mere 60 years so, curls finally recaptured crown.Beyond personal source frustration (rarely) satisfaction, hair signaled person’s political cultural views. During English Civil War, Puritans wore hair closely cropped derisively called “Roundheads.”This contrast royalist Cavaliers, wore hair ringlets past shoulders. During 1960s, college boys came home long hair, parents knew signaled hippie beliefs occasionally held sons cut hair.Today, one’s hair express one’s politics signify one’s profession. Sixty years ago, “Beatnik chicks” wore hair long loose waist. Today, woman hair corporate executive. The guy man bun tax attorney.But hair bond other. In ’90s, Black community, women unprocessed hair recognized smile nod. Going natural signaled authenticity. Now ways signal Black pride, weaves locks buzz cuts cornrows. This January, significant readjustment policy, Army issued new set guidelines, allowing Black female soldiers greater flexibility wear hair.Other people bonded hair “silver foxes”: attractive women let hair gray white naturally. My friend Kathy started white age 40; today, shining, chin-length bob convenient maintain signals assurance, confidence doesn’t need artifice look good. When I walk New York her, I women white hair good clothes giving friend “the look”: approval, commonality, sisterhood.I can’t join sisterhood I’m married younger man mustn’t mistaken mother! But cousin Jackie joined sorority. I recently saw person time year. She’d stopped coloring hair pandemic; black hair contains bands silver. “It’s gorgeous,” I told her, sincerely. My hair that: uniform, mousy gray.She said: \"I\\'d hair like yours.\" As holidays approach, divorced brace emotional onslaught, especially children involved. Holidays challenging divorce. Our young adult children live different cities come hometown Thanksgiving Christmas. They attempt split time households, adjustments accommodations easy.Holidays laden expectations, formed childhoods. Divorce throws monkey wrench things. For me, having expectations breeds resentment. So I try minimize them.According 2019 census figures, 7.6 1,000 marriages U.S. ends divorce.The majority ofthose divorces occur families children age 18.For welfare children, important spouses try establish conflict-free parenting relationships minimize difficulties. Children suffer parents’ decisions.Port-divorce co-parenting relationships run wide gamut. Some couples seamlessly. Jacqueline “Jack” Perez, 57, Chapel Hill, North Carolina, ex-husband began dividing holidays evenly. Once son old voice opinion, tried accommodate wishes. “I I feel incredibly grateful ex I security stability child’s life ours,” Perez says. “We happy missing particular holiday, griped son. Grownups need grown-up.”For others, however, anger seeps interactions planning. I little contact ex-husband. We communicate text, necessary. I hope friends future possibly spend time children.My parents divorced I 6. When I young, I thrilled split household, thrilled celebrate Christmases, multiple gifts houses. As I got older, I look forward much. My ex, money I do, takes children partners expensive post-Christmas trip, rankles me. I learned grateful kids opportunities recognize love around. But easy.I checked wise divorced women, children ages, tips best way handle challenging holiday season. Clear communication paramount, say.“In beginning, stressful,” says Sue Sudbay, 59, Palm Springs, California. “I think key proactive early communication you, kids. For example, send email say, ‘I’m planning having kids year Thanksgiving. How come place dessert?’ The thing worked didn’t come house, we’d Thanksgiving dinner Saturday Sunday after. We’d sit watch football enjoy nice day together. It felt good actual holiday, kids having bounce forth.”Cecily Banks, 57, Warren, Rhode Island, ex-husband decision early separation come unit important family holiday events. “We told children marital situation painful loss, determinative continue family,” says Banks “We told loving, supportive unit. As ex-husband I moved long-term relationships significant others, brought partners fold celebrate family holiday occasions them. That don’t feel deep loss marriage single-family unit, don’t feel loss loving joyful moments.”Denver, Colorado, resident, Erin Glover, 60, advises flexibility taking personally. She considerate children leave ex-spouse’s home. “Remember, creating memories experiences, don’t want children feel guilty sharing time ex-husband,” advises Glover. “It’s respectful children’s feelings. I coordinate times holiday meals ex-husband, try sons eat house, recognizing visit father. Above else, things bring children closer pushing away guilt bad-mouthing father. It goes long way text email ex-husband Father’s Day, saying thank fathering beautiful children.”As I navigating holidays divorce, succeed making new traditions children.But recognize control. My ex hosts children Thanksgiving brunch I Thanksgiving dinner. My ex gets kids Christmas Eve I Christmas Day. Now adult children partners, I share holiday time parents well.Since people compete time beloved children, I focus quality time instead quantity. Be present celebrate — children roof.

So, part, foundation rest. Concealer, however, story. Apply normally don’t forget eyes. The coronavirus stress real, dark circles prove it.The Ethel great resource. But AARP members access array programs, resources discounts. A divorced friend texting man met online dating site 60-plus set. Things moving merrily little joke gaining pounds COVID sequester hoped Weight Watchers offered lifelong memberships. He responded emoji. Mind you, ubiquitous happy face emoji conveys “that’s funny” “great.” No, strange unfamiliaremojithat, later passed friends, drew interpretations ranging “I’m stunned good way” “Well, that’s unfortunate news. Where’s exit ’cause I’m outa here.”For reason, older men flub big comes messaging. Even enlightened ones struggle communicate honest, respectful unhurtful way recognizes concerns modern older women. Here things men date them, sound touch plain don’t recognize societal changes occurred past half century so.Those “my wife boss me” sayingsWe’ve heard them: “A happy wife makes happy life,” ubiquitous “Yes, dear,” perennial favorite, “Ask missus.” What sayings common convey message you, man, (falsely) claiming powerless — subject whims woman. And you, man, voice decision-making goes relationship this, somehow, supposed seen adorable appealing women. Sorry, dude, no.Saying things ignores fact men vastly power women pretty aspect existence. And ignores fact women want partners, subjects lord over.Further, agree Henny Youngman long dead? While successful comedian day, day considered funny mock wife marriage long passed. So, “Take wife, please.”Those sayings deny feelings dismiss usLet’s start “Calm down,” command men use midst heated discussion literally failed 100 percent time uttered. Saying “Calm down” exactly opposite; infuriates. It’s akin waving red cape charging bull.Why? Because women hear as, “You behaving hysterically acting emotionally.” It fails calm down, infuriates women trying heard feelings validated. A raised voice frustrated voice. If want lower voice, acknowledge you’ve heard it. Closely related “Calm down” dismissive “What now?” Saying serves convey impatience anger having speak subject clearly feel uncomfortable about. You missing big opportunity delve deeper what’s going us. Try “I’m glad willing talk me.”Those sayings infer judgement according else’s standards woman be“Did eat fries?” flip side, “Is you’re going eat?” observations probably best left unspoken. Men don’t control woman eat. Many grew era women valued appearance. That time over. Don’t tell I “smile more” — man? And love things good, don’t encourage order dessert comment I sweet tooth. That’s setup.Those sayings mean compliments kind aren’t“You look great. How weight lost?” Let’s start saying judged appearance anyone’s best interest. A simple “So nice again,” suffices keeps inoffensive ground. In particular case, try flipping so-called compliment tail. Aren’t fact saying overweight unattractive past?“You don’t look 70.” Here’s raised eyebrow that. If I’m 70 I look like, means, 70 looks like — speaker’s false preconceived notion whathe thinksa 70-year-old woman look like. It compliment I don’t look age wrong looking 70. And times let emoji talking you, use caution. They don’t mean think. Here’s handyreference guideto new batch 2021. In Kilgore, Idaho, turn 15-mile gravel-and-dirt road bison wandered highway. It lumbered RV, point mere 18 inches away us, watched, stunned size, casual gait, command space it.Those couple sentences I expected write. Like rest world pandemic hit, husband, Peter, I trying figure lives. Peter resigned job miserably unhappy. He confident work airline aerospace industries, spent 38-year career.As freelance writer, I didn’t feel change work life pandemic. Still, big adjustment having Peter home time; luck it, jobs aerospace airline industries rare. After months household projects, gardening, reading books, watching news, Zoom parties hours spent discussing going “this” over, decided Peter wanted long I’ve known him.We rented RV went road trip. I realize RV trips regular people’s lives. For me, idea traveling RV sounded romantic. Still, facts — small space, less-than-luxurious accommodations, great outdoors, hours driving — daunting. I knew things, though. Peter wanted and, wanted fly, way going away home new — needed do.So, threw planning came “safecation.” Traveling RV weeks takes considerable preparation, I excellent planner. I lists food bring supplies buy itineraries. I printed maps contacted RV parks. Peter bought hammocks small propane grill. We packed large containers, picked RV, loaded containers RV bought lots food bottled water. Then headed unexpectedly fantastic two-week vacation.The RV parks chose remote parts states traveled through, including California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Utah Nevada. Because that, Google maps took small highways fantastic scenery, like seen before.While driving, didn’t talk much; busy looking window. We saw multicolored mountains, countless cows endless bales hay, dusty fields suddenly turned bright green acres grass, rivers, lakes, waterfalls streams, abandoned houses beautiful iconic. In places, fire-scorched acres interrupted beauty, softened new growth poking burnt trees.We drove tiny little towns populations numbering figures stoplights. Still, church gas station, towns peaceful, I hoped pleasant Mayberry. We stopped coffee doughnuts cupcakes small coffee shops wore masks. While people wary us, friendly. We strangers, it’s strange time.There bumps winding roads. For trip, WiFi cell service spotty, places nonexistent. RV camps, part, offer access, depending guests it, remote camp is, unreliable. In way, offline added experience instead detracting — I read books trip weren’t notifications updates distract me.Our bed small, uncomfortable crowded Peter me, dog (who champion traveler) vying space. The shower satisfactory, mildly. RVing involves feeling grimy time. Many camps didn’t allow open flames season, glad propane grill — fine burgers, great s’mores I looked forward enjoying, work. After all, what’s camping s’mores?For people adventurous, trip brought much-needed excitement lives. The pandemic sapped energy. Peter turned 60 year, I’m far behind. It felt like pushed old age lot sooner anticipated, confined home and, Peter, working. It lot angst. As good marriage is, lives, like people’s, robbed joy. Seeing unique beautiful places, pretty right backyard, pandemic.We delighted amazed enjoyed ourselves. Of things saw, bison Idaho favorite. He comfortable himself.

Marital bliss possible partner blissful outlets apart other.7. Be grateful.Remember thank confident flexible spouse allows independent fulfilling life marriage. Don’t try win fight; in, surrender “I’m sorry” (even you’re sorry bit). Holding snarly anger forms toxic wedges time. Demonstrating ongoing vulnerability compassion definitely makes spouses behave better. And, ability bounce strife arguments real secret turns dark day new day marriage — turn decades.8.

I’m surprised hair feels like cotton candy, looks like straw breaking thinning, I’ve there, too. And let clue in: Celebs immune hair havoc, either. Their frequent style color changes hide mishaps. Here’s rehab plan works all.1. Make big cutFor long hair devotees, ends oldest most-damaged they’ve exposed heat chemicals years. Splits start travel like zipper scalp.

Women stick-straight hair going “natural” wavier curlier look, alternating sleek blowouts air-drying. If color hair, giving wavy option helps ease constant chemical/heat stress. When blow-dry, let hair air-dry 50 percent heat-styling, use heat-protectant spray first. Flip hair blow-dry low-heat setting underneath, fingers untangle, lift encourage volume.8. Switch sulfate-free shampoo conditionerYou won’t big, sudsy feeling sulfates — detergents — create bubbles, preserving chemical-color salon-straightening treatments. Look duos strengthening protein wheat keratin provide moisture boost botanical oils butters. Drugstore brands like L’Oreal Paris EverPure, OGX, Suave Professionals SheaMoisture right ingredients increase shine reboot dry hair.9. Make hair masks twice-weekly habitRegular conditioners enough. Drugstore masks easier homemade mashed avocado-and-egg kind, smell better rinse easily. Choose one-shot foil packets try several, opt tube jar style packed oils like Argan Marula shea butter. The label leave — 10 — minutes, hair favor leave overnight (with plastic wrap turban pillow pristine). Use wide-tooth comb distribute mask evenly hair, little extra areas brittle weak.10. Buy microfiber hair towelThis sounds unnecessary, it’s small thing that’s super-kind hair. The minute step shower, bend waist wrap hair these. It absorbs excess water like sponge. Normal towels rough hair’s cuticle, causing shingle-like coating hair shafts lift instead lying flat — encourage breakage frizz.And word: Beat hair burnout begins. Toss old brushes bent bristles, replace fine-tooth combs hair-friendly wide-tooth ones, avoid wearing styling hair way day.
