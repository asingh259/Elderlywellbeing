From playing team sports to class projects to moving heavy furniture,\n    we all experience moments in our lives that require us to work hand in hand to complete a task or achieve a common goal. What’s more, these days, our input is highly sought after. Think back to when you were last emailed a customer satisfaction\n    survey following a visit to a store or asked to rate an app on your tablet or smartphone. Our feedback is valuable because it allows the companies and organizations providing us with products and/or services to better understand their userbase and\n    optimize their offerings. Luckily, the benefits of collective action and providing opportunities for users to share their thoughts, opinions, and experiences are wide-reaching—even extending to the health space. For instance, collaboration or dialogue between patients, caregivers,\n    and health care providers through hospital-discharge planning, personalized care planning, and advanced care planning can reduce hospital readmissions, improve aspects of physical and mental health, and increase the chances of the patient’s\n    wishes being followed, respectively (1-3). The question then becomes, can engaging patients in decision making that goes beyond interventions related to their individual care and involves the design, management, delivery, and/or evaluation of public\n    services also yield positive outcomes? This type of activity is known as co-production and can be voluntary or involuntary (4;5). Arapid reviewevaluating the co-production of hospital tools and resources with patients adds more to this conversation\n    (4). Within the review, co-produced services and tools included ‘teachback’ (a technique that aims to increase patients’ understanding of instructions provided by a health care provider), patient incident reporting tools, patient-oriented\n    discharge summaries, lists of questions to encourage discussion between patients, caregivers, and care providers, and an information and communication technology platform for patient-reported symptoms. The intensity at which patients were engaged\n    in the co-production process varied. For example, some patients were ‘consulted’ through interviews or surveys, others were ‘involved’ through workshops and focus groups, and a few were ‘partners’ participating\n    in meetings, experience-based collaboratives, and working groups. To summarize, the review found that co-production may help to improve organizational/health care provider outcomes and patient level outcomes. In terms of organizational/health care provider outcomes, co-produced services and tools may rate high to moderate\n    when it comes to user satisfaction, usability, uptake, and retention. In terms of patient outcomes, co-produced services and tools have the potential to reduce wait times, as well as enhance the timely delivery of home medication and patients’\n    understanding of their medication. They may also improve knowledge, confidence, and skills in patients involved in the co-production process. Despite some of these promising results, it’s important to note that more research on the effects of co-production on patients and health care providers is needed to make definitive conclusions on the use of this strategy. A greater understanding\n    of the impact on patients’ health outcomes would be especially useful (4). In the meantime, those interested in voicing their opinions and sharing their experiences to help inform health care-related tools and resources can seek out available\n    opportunities to do so. Patient advocacy groups, your health care team, and trusted hospital websites are a few sources that may help link you to these opportunities and are a good starting point for your search.""]"

The closure of office spaces and schools, restrictions on visiting loved ones, healthcare facilities and nursing homes have greatly limited our ability to maintain ""face-to-face"" connections. Our lives have quickly pivoted to virtual communication platforms to stay connected and go about our business. Overnight, happy hours with friends, birthdays, work meetings, homeschooling, medical follow-ups... everything was going to happen on the screen. More and more people have been complaining of ""Zoom fatigue,"" a term referring to the popular videoconferencing platform. This expression reflects the anxiety and exhaustion linked to the overuse of virtual communication platforms such as Zoom, Skype, FaceTime, Google Meet or Microsoft Teams. Since the beginning of the pandemic, older adults, caregivers and families have been told over and over again to use technology to stay in touch, and to prevent and control the spread of the virus. We know that technology can cause stress in older adults, as evidenced by studies conducted in 2016 and 2020 in people aged 60 and older. This ""techno-stress"" results from the ubiquity of information and communication technologies in modern society and their impacts: information overload, invasion of privacy, blurring between public and personal life, and pressure to develop digital skills.(1) Although no robust systematic review could be identified about zoom fatigue among older adults and the general population, experts (including psychologists, computer scientists and neuroscientists) have raised a red flag. The overuse of virtual communication platforms could lead to cognitive distortions and non-verbal  overload inherent in video communication. This could even increase feelings of isolation and anxiety.(2) A researcher from Stanford University in the United States recently published an article on the phenomenon of Zoom fatigue, which may be attributable to four main factors.(3) 1- Excessive eye contact During a videoconference, seeing others in close-up and being stared at by several pairs of eyes is unnatural and creates performance anxiety. 2- Cognitive overload In front of the camera, we are constantly on the lookout for our gestures to make sure we are sending the right signal to others. For example, we force ourselves to nod for long seconds or give a thumbs up to show our agreement, etc. Non-verbal language is thus controlled, which scrambles the signals sent and generates intense brain activity to decode them. 3- Loss of mobility In a face-to-face meeting, non-verbal communication is done unconsciously and freely. During a phone call, people can walk, stretch, yawn, scribble. Not in front of a screen where we are forced to stay still and centred in front of the camera. All this greatly reduces our mobility and well-being. 4- The mirror effect Seeing yourself on the screen, under an unflattering light and for many hours can have a perverse effect and generate stress or negative feelings. Nobody (or almost nobody) likes to look in the mirror all day long! The concerns related to virtual communication platforms remind us that it can be important to better dose their use. It\'s not always justified choosing the videoconference for every call we make. That said, if you do, there are some small things you can do to reduce the cognitive overload and stress you may feel: - Hide the camera so you don\'t see your reflection all the time; - Reduce the size of the windows of the people you are talking with so that you don\'t see them in large shots; - Take breaks to look around or stretch; or - Choose a different location or different tools to hold your meetings, such as a better chair or a portable keyboard. If you feel depressed, irritated, tired after your videoconference meetings, don\'t hesitate to suggest to your friends, family and colleagues to use the good old phone once in a while!']"

So, what exactly is blood pressure, and why is it important to keep it in check? First, blood pressure is the pressure blood exerts on the walls of blood vessels/arteries\n    as it’s pumped through the body by the heart (1;2). When this pressure is consistently too high, we have high blood pressure or hypertension, and our heart has to work harder to pump blood (2). Globally, more than 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women\n    have high blood pressure (1). High blood pressure is dangerous because it puts us at a greater risk for developing and dying from diseases of the heart, kidney, and brain, to name a few (2). Our diet, so what we eat and drink regularly, can affect our blood pressure (2;3-10). Consuming an unhealthy diet, such as one that’s low in fruits and vegetables and high in salt, increases our chance of developing high blood pressure (2). On the\n    other hand, healthier diets are associated with a lower risk of developing high blood pressure. Vegetarian and vegan diets, in particular, have been placed under the microscope and studied for their impacts on blood pressure (3;9-10). However, plant-based\n    diets go beyond these two diets. They include a wide variety of dietary patterns, some of which allow for an often-limited amount of meat and other animal products (3). Let’s dive deeper into the world of plant-based diets by familiarizing ourselves with some common types in the table below. This is a lot of information to take in, and with so many options available, it can be hard to know what diet to follow to reduce our blood pressure. Arecentsystematic reviewaimed to help by investigating these diets further and laying out the evidence (3). Of the seven plant-based diets studied within the review, only three show the potential to positively impact both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These are the DASH, lacto-ovo vegetarian, and healthy Nordic diets. The Mediterranean diet may also\n    have blood pressure lowering effects, but only for systolic blood pressure. Overall, the diets that were effective in reducing one or more aspects of blood pressure often encouraged the consumption of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, nuts,\n    seeds, and a limited amount of animal products. The remaining three diets—the high fruit and vegetable, high fiber, and vegan diets—do not appear to lower any aspect of blood pressure. It's worth mentioning that the vegan diet was the\n    only plant-based dietary pattern studied that completely eliminates the consumption of animal products. These results are important because they imply that diets that are much less restrictive show promise for success. With that said, the certainty of the evidence that these results are based on ranges from very low-to-high and differs depending on what diet and aspect of blood pressure you're looking at. The DASH diet is the only diet whose findings are based on high\n    certainty evidence across the board; this means that future research likely won’t change the finding that it reduces both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The same can be said for the lacto-ovo vegetarian diet’s impact on systolic\n    blood pressure, specifically. As for the other findings, we are less confident that the results wont change as more research comes out (3). There you have it, plant-based diets may hold blood pressure benefits, but not all diets that fall under this category are equal. If you're interested in making a lifestyle change through your diet, speak with your health care team about what dietary\n    pattern is the best fit for you and how to safely make this change.""]"

Several platforms to find love have been created. The same is true for other stages of a couple\'s lifecycle: whether it is to use technology to maintain a relationship or to regain autonomy after the dissolution of a couple. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased our online activities and forced people of all ages to use the Internet to connect with others. Today, we can express our interest in someone with a simple swipe of a finger on a screen or by sending an emoji. We show digital affection  to celebrate our love. It goes without saying that technology is having a profound and very real impact on our love live. A recent systematic review of 72 studies examined the use of technology throughout the lifecycle of a romantic relationship.(1) While these studies did not specifically target older adults, they found that ""cyber-intimacy"" has a real and profound impact regardless of age. The review reveals that technologies can influence three stages in the lifecycle of a romantic relationship: 1) how people find and meet partners online; 2) the ways in which partners use technologies to maintain their relationship; and 3) how people cope with the process of dissolving their romantic relationship and using technologies to regain a sense of autonomy. Studies indicate that the ability to connect with someone we like is made easier online. People seem to be more uninhibited when they are behind their screen and allow themselves to engage in virtual behaviours that they wouldn\'t dare in ""real"" life. However, being confronted with many potential partners can lead to poor choices, by not being as selective and being distracted by the array of profiles presented to us. Are you officially in a relationship? You must now comply with the rules that govern love in the digital age. Beware of the lover who doesn\'t change their marital status on Facebook to reflect their commitment. Studies show that public displays of affection on social networks increase couple satisfaction. Using technology can be helpful in maintaining or strengthening the bond with your partner, whether it\'s texting and taking pictures (or even consuming sexual content as a couple). But beware! Different digital habits can lower relationship satisfaction. In addition, jealousy can quickly arise, especially if one partner spends too much time online and initiates interactions with other people. During a relationship, a couple accumulates digital ""assets"" - photos, videos, texts - just like furniture or a car. When the relationship ends, lovers must do a digital housecleaning, such as removing the other from their contacts, removing shared photos, changing their online status, etc. Moving on can be complicated, especially if the estranged partner spies on their ex on social media or engages in cyber-stalking. That said, technology can help with the dissolution of a romantic relationship by helping former partners regain a sense of autonomy. Security and privacy are important concerns when it comes to technology. A few caveats are in order: - If you are looking for your soul mate, check out dating sites that verify the identity of users. Most sites are open to people of all ages, but some specialize in people over 50, or bring together people with common interests, such as culture and the outdoors. - Be careful with the personal information you share online (including images or videos that could identify and locate you). - On social media, question yourself before making information public. Keep in mind that this information, as well as suggestive photographs and sexting, is always accessible on digital devices and could be distributed to others without your consent. - Don\'t hesitate to report anyone who threatens, harasses or sends you unsolicited sexually explicit messages or images. Confide in a loved one, a support worker or call the police if your safety is threatened.']"

They are all ways that people can listen to music, the universal language that breaks down barriers—like space and time—and builds invisible bridges that connect\n    us. Renowned American TV and radio personality Dick Clark once said that “Music is the soundtrack of your life.” If you take a second to think about it, Mr. Clark was spot-on. Music acts as a timestamp. With the press of a button, it can\n    transport us to different times in our lives, such as our first high school dance, favourite concert, or wedding day. With these memories come the thoughts and emotions we felt in those moments. Given the power it holds, it is not surprising that\n    music has entered the health arena and has been the focus of many studies (1-10). So, what does the research have to say about the benefits of music for our mental and physical health? Here are just a few of the evidence-based findings on the important role that music can play. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Music for hospital stays Surgery and a hospital stay are no walk in the park; for many of us, they are stressful and scary. Music therapy, a safe and non-invasive complementary strategy to medical treatments, can yield positive results for cancer patients who are in hospital\n    to undergo a surgery/procedure/treatment (2;4). More specifically, patients who listen to music before and/or after a surgery/procedure/treatment may experience moderate reductions in anxiety, pain, and depression. Slightly less fatigue may be another\n    plus (4). There is evidence to suggest that greater benefits can be attained when patients choose their own music (3;4). 2.Music for walking As we age, we may notice changes to our walking ability, such as our steps becoming shorter and pace slowing down. Changes like these can reduce mobility and increase the risk of falls (10;11). But do not be disheartened! There are ways to ""side-step""\n    these issues, or at the very least, lessen them. Listening to a steady beat (e.g., like that provided by a metronome) or music while walking can help to enhance walking speed, the length of our stride, and the rhythm and symmetry of our walk (7;8). When\n    choosing what to listen to, aim for music with a unique and stable rhythm; and that you find enjoyable. Remember not to “lose yourself to the music,” meaning keep the volume at an acceptable level that does not hinder your ability to be\n    aware of your surroundings, namely traffic, people, and other important noises. 3.Music for sleep quality Not getting good quality sleep can negatively impact our mental, cognitive, and physical health (10;12-15). Although medications for sleep-related issues do exist, they are associated with unwanted side effects, such as an increased risk for illness,\n    dependence, and death (10;16-18). Alternatively, music-based interventions—which generally involve listening to music and in some cases also making it—are non-drug strategies that appear to have the potential to improve sleep quality.\n    Although generally deemed a safe strategy, take stock of any possible hazards and put in place actions to remedy them (10). For instance, using headphones while sleeping may not be ideal, so speakers may be the way to go. Maintaining volume control\n    is also important. There you have it! There is research that supports the use of music in specific scenarios, such as hospital stays, walking, and sleep-related matters. More research is needed to better understand the effects of music-based strategies, but because they\n    have been found to be generally safe, non-invasive, and cost-effective, they may be worth a try. But first, consult with your health care team for a comprehensive discussion of the potential pros and safety considerations.']"

The terms misinformation and disinformation are often used interchangeably, but they have different meanings.Misinformationis false information that is spread, regardless of intent to mislead. On the other hand,disinformationis the intentional spreading of misinformation. For instance, we often see political opponents, companies, or foreign governments engaging in disinformation campaigns to achieve a specific goal or undermine trust in their opponents. It is often difficult to determine the underlying intent and thus, the term misinformation may be used more frequently.While misinformation has been with us for centuries, the internet has transformed its scale, drivers and consequences, as well as possible responses to it. In 2022, theGlobal Commission on Evidence to Address Societal Challengesexamined possible response types to misinformation.(1) The Evidence Commission identified 10 possible responses: 1. Monitoring and fact-checkingThis type of response includes monitoring and exposing misinformation (for example, debunked claims) and fact-checking new claims with we increasingly see in news media. 2. Credibility labelingThis type of response includes tools to verify information content, web-content indicators, pointing to credible evidence sources, and adding credibility labels to information sources. 3. EducationalThis type of response includes increasing media and information literacy among the public (for example, critical-thinking skills and skills to verify the credibility of resources on the internet), as well as journalists’ information literacy. 4. CuratorialThis response type includes pointing the public to official credible  sources of evidence-based information, and can be used by news media, social media, messaging and search platforms. 5. Technical and algorithmicThis type of response is increasingly discussed in relation to the work of Big Tech companies (for example, Google, Facebook and others). It covers a spectrum from human learning to machine learning and other artificial-intelligence approaches to identify misinformation, provide additional context, and limit spread the spread of misinformation. 6. Counter-misinformation campaignsThis type of response includes specialized units to develop counter-narratives to challenge misinformation and mobilizing online communities to spread high-quality evidence. 7. NormativeThis type of response includes public condemnations of acts of misinformation (from public figures, such as policymakers, professionals, and community leaders) and recommendations to address them. 8. EconomicThis type of response is also discuss in relation to the work of Big Tech companies. It includes advertising bans (for example, ads promoting miracle remedies against COVID-19), and other approaches to remove incentives for misinformation. 9. Legislative and other policyThis type of response includes criminalizing acts of misinformation, directing internet communication companies to take down content, and providing material support for credible information sources 10. InvestigativeThis type of response includes strategies to investigate who starts the misinformation, the degree and means of spread, the money involved, and the affected communities. This response can help to inform legislative and other responses. Our times may seem a bit confusing with the multiplication of information sources, health and social crises, as well as strong political polarization. We are constantly bombarded with information and it becomes difficult to distinguish credible information from misleading or false information. However, as the Evidence Commission points out, it is possible to act locally and globally to counter misinformation.']"

Modifiable behaviours and metabolic risk factors increase the risk of developing a chronic illness\n    (1). For example, modifiable behaviours, such as an unhealthy diet, can lead to metabolic issues, like overweight or obesity, which in turn can elevate the risk of heart disease and multiple other health conditions (1;2). Too much sugar—specifically,\n    sugars added to food and drinks during manufacturing or at the table prior to consumption—is often suggested as a contributing factor to overweight, obesity, and the development of chronic illness. This may make us pause before adding sugar\n    to our hot beverage in the morning or while whipping up some sweet treats. Over the years, there has been a push to identity strategies that can help fight the obesity “epidemic”. The use of non-nutritive sugar substitutes as an alternative way of sweetening foods and drinks is one method that has caught the attention\n    of researchers. These sugar substitutes offer no nutritional value and have little-to-no calories. They go by a variety of names, including non-nutritive sweeteners, non-caloric or very low-calorie sweeteners, or artificial sweeteners (2). These substitutes\n    are found in some food and beverage options, such as “diet” or “sugar free” carbonated drinks, nut spreads, and breakfast cereals. Certain types are also available as table-top sweeteners (3). Interestingly, past studies have\n    made the case for and against the use of sugar substitutes, with some finding that they may increase weight by encouraging folks to eat more, and others demonstrating that they assist with weight loss (2;4-7). Arecentsystematic reviewaimed to provide\n    more clarity on the topic by taking a comprehensive look at the evidence, including newly published studies (2). The review compared changes in weight/body mass index in folks consuming non-nutritive sweeteners, such asaspartame,stevia,sucralose,saccharin, andrebaudioside A(Reb A), to those consuming table sugar, water, and placebo, or given nothing. Overall,\n    the review found that the use of non-nutritive sweeteners may help reduce weight/body mass index by a small to moderate amount. But a closer look at the data shows that these benefits may only be obtained by certain individuals or under certain conditions.\n    For instance, it appears that children or adolescents, folks considered to be at a normal weight, and those following a weight reduction diet may not see results. On the other hand, adults, folks living with overweight or obesity, and those who are\n    following an unrestricted diet may reap the weight-related rewards. What’s more, it appears that non-nutritive sweeteners have the potential to be effective when they are a substitute for table sugar, specifically. With all this said, we do\n    have to consider that the findings presented here are based on low to moderate quality evidence, with outcomes only measured in the short term. This means more high-quality studies with longer follow-up periods are needed to really understand what\n    impact non-nutritive sweeteners have on weight in the short term and long term. Only a few studies included in the review reported on side effects. Generally, both the group consuming non-nutritive sweeteners and the group not consuming them experienced similar minor side effects. These included: behavioural issues, bowel changes,\n    allergies, and abdominal discomfort. Some studies conducted deeper investigations and found that all or some of the side effects seen were not related to the non-nutritive sweeteners used (2). Outside of this review, it is important to note that various\n    non-nutritive and nutritive sweeteners have been approved for use at specific levels/amounts by Health Canada, meaning their safety has been assessed and that their use is strictly regulated (3). For a full list of permitted sweeteners and more information,\n    refer to the Government of Canada’swebsite. If you are interested in using non-nutritive\n    sweeteners, whether as a table-top sweetener or by focusing on foods that contain them, speak with your health care team first to assess if they are safe for you based on any existing conditions you may have and for guidance on use.']"

Some dogs even play crucial roles with people who have health conditions. Just think of guide dogs for the visually impaired, or assistance dogs for people with a physical disability, or those with diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorders or Alzheimer\'s: there is no denying that dogs are excellent companions. The physical and psychological health benefits of owning a dog appear to be numerous. Indeed, several studies indicate that owning a dog is associated with a lower risk of asthma and cardiovascular disease, lower blood pressure and stress, as well as improved well-being, alleviation of social isolation and increased physical activity. A recent Canadian study revealed that dog owners appear to have enjoyed better mental health since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.(1) But does owning a dog lead to a longer, healthier life? A recent systematic review of 10 studies, examining data on more than three million participants between 1950 and 2019, examined the long-term survival of older adults who are dog owners.(2) The review finds that having a dog is associated with a 24% reduction in the risk of death from all causes. Better yet: in people who have had coronary events in the past (for example, a heart attack), living in a house with a dog is associated with an even more pronounced reduction in the risk of death from all causes. In addition, when researchers narrowed the analyzes to studies assessing mortality from cardiovascular problems, having a dog conferred a 31% reduction in the risk of death. How to explain such a reduction in the risk of mortality? The reduction in the risk of mortality for dog owners is possibly due to a reduction in cardiovascular deaths. Dog owners are physically active because they have to walk their pets every day. They are therefore less likely to develop diabetes, have a lower resting heart rate and a better stress response. This means that increased physical activity is associated with a lower risk of death and heart problems. In addition, having a dog has beneficial social and psychological effects for the elderly. For example, compared to other activities, simply petting a dog lowers blood pressure. In addition, since many older adults live alone, the presence of an animal helps to break loneliness and create interactions with other people during walks, thus promoting better well-being and healthy aging. Adopting a dog can be rewarding,\xa0 but also challenging, especially for older adults who may have limited income, or who have serious health or mobility issues. Adopting a dog is not a decision to be taken lightly:']"

Floss at least once a day. Don’t forget to scrape or brush your tongue. Use a mouthwash or rinse once a day, generally in the morning, and toothpastes that contain fluoride. Opt for water\n    over sugary drinks. Consume a well-balanced and nutritious diet. Decrease your alcohol intake. Quit smoking or vaping. According to the Canadian Dental Association, these are all components of a good oral hygiene routine that will help us maintain\n    the health of our teeth, mouths, and bodies (1). When it comes to meeting some of these requirements, Canadians are falling short. In 2018, it was reported that around 78% of those aged 12 and older brush their teeth at least twice a day, while only 43% floss at least once a day. If we look at those\n    who both brush and floss their teeth daily, this number decreases even further to about 38% (2). Brushing and flossing are important practices that help with the removal of dental plaque. Have you ever run your tongue across your teeth and felt a ‘fuzzy’ sensation? That’s plaque—a sticky and invisible bacteria-filled film. If not removed daily and left to buildup, plaque can lead to cavities, tooth decay, and mild to severe gum diseases (3). Although all aspects of oral hygiene are important, let’s zero in on the most common form of plaque removal, brushing our teeth (4). The market is currently flooded with manual and powered toothbrushes that help us engage in this activity. But is\n    there a difference in how effective they are in removing plaque? A relativelyrecentsystematic reviewlooked at the evidence (5). The studies included in the review had participants—who were generally healthy adults with noperiodontitis, treatments fixing the positioning of the teeth,\n    dentures, or dental implants—brush their teeth with a single-headed manual toothbrush or a single-headed rechargeable powered toothbrush. The powered toothbrushes varied in how they moved or functioned, but the most commonly used types were\n    oscillatingâ\x80\x90rotating brushes and side-to-side brushes. With an oscillating-rotating mode of action, the head of the brush rotates in one direction and then another; but with a side-to-side mode of action, the head of the brush moves from side-to-side. Ultimately, the review found that after a single brushing exercise, rechargeable powered toothbrushes may be slightly more effective at removing plaque than manual toothbrushes. A closer look at mode of action also demonstrates that both oscillatingâ\x80\x90rotating\n    and side-to-side powered toothbrushes are more effective than manual toothbrushes (5). While this review did not compare the two types of powered toothbrushes directly, another morerecent reviewsuggests that neither oscillatingâ\x80\x90rotating powered toothbrushes nor side-to-side powered toothbrushes are better than one another at reducing plaque or gingivitis. This means their benefits may be comparable (4). Do these results mean that we should replace our manual toothbrushes with powered ones? Not necessarily. The findings presented don't show that manual toothbrushes aren’t effective; they just demonstrate that powered ones may have slightly more\n    benefits. So, take a pause before rushing to the bathroom to throw out your manual toothbrush. Instead, enjoy the fact that you have more oral health tools to choose from and a better chance of finding a product that meets your needs—such as\n    those related to mobility, cost, assistance with brushing for the recommended amount of time, and more. Be it comparing the pros and cons of products online or seeking advice from an oral health professional, if possible, do your homework before committing\n    to your next toothbrush. Don’t forget, your oral health matters!""]"

This generally includes more care than can be safely met through supportive housing or a retirement home, but not so much care that they require admission to a hospital unit. Throughout the pandemic, the focus has been on improving the prevention and management of COVID-19 outbreaks in long-term care homes. But many policymakers and stakeholders are now turning their attention to renewing the long-term care sector and exploring alternatives to long-term care homes. A recent review examined what is known from research evidence about supporting renewal in long-term care homes in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. They\xa0also examined what was done in Canada and in eight other countries (Australia, France, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, New Zealand, United Kingdom, United States). These countries were selected because they are advanced in their approaches and delivery of long-term care or are good comparators to Canada. The review identified 204 highly relevant documents that could inform renewal in long-term care homes. Three themes were found that could contribute to therenewal of long-term care:- making public investments in long-term care (particularly in light of the pandemic as population needs are high and a significant burden of care has been placed on caregivers over the past 18-months);- ensuring models of care include dementia care and mobility services for residents; and- addressing outdated physical infrastructure (for example, older designs of rooms and common spaces, poor ventilation, multi-bed rooms, and larger homes), which contributed to a higher incidence rate of COVID-19 and poorer resident satisfaction with care. Reflections are also ongoing aboutimproving supports for residents and staff, notably:- significant staffing shortages since the pandemic, with many workers having left due to unsafe working conditions and burnout;- public-image campaigns alongside financial support for training and guaranteed job entry could support recruitment of new workers in long-term care;- increases in wages, availability of full-time work (as opposed to part-time positions), and providing equitable benefits, such as paid sick leave can improve recruitment and retention of workers;psycho-social supports including counselling, therapy and psycho-educational training to identify signs of burnout can help retention of staff;- enforcing safety standards such as mandatory staff-ratios (how many staff needed for each resident), frequent inspections, and mandatory reporting of quality indicators can improve the safety and quality of the work environment for staff as well as living environment for residents;- shared decision-making with residents and their families or caregivers was found to have positive outcomes for residents (but it requires an investment in staff training to ensure it is delivered effectively); and- interoperable electronic health records may enhance quality of care as well as the improved management of clinical documentation (but some long-term care homes have been slow to adopt them and to put in place training and processes to support their use). Lastly, three themes emerged aboutpromoting alternatives to long-term care homes:- providing additional supports in the community (for example, enhancing the use of technologies at home and expanding at-home palliative-care services) can help older adults to remain at home longer and empower older adults and their families to choose if and when to enter long-term care;- expanding benefits for home-care clients, including increasing the number of hours for personal care (for example, bathing, cleaning, preparing meals) and flexibility in working time and temporary absences for caregivers can help to make home care a more viable alternative to long-term care; and- greater coordination between home-care supports and primary-care providers can support older adults to age in place. The reflections and debates concerning the renewal of long-term care are not something new. It remains to be seen whether the sense of urgency created by the pandemic will be sufficient to keep this issue on top of the governmental agenda and bring about sustainable change.']"

However, catching cancer early can increase the chance of successfully treating it. One strategy for early diagnosis is screening. The purpose of screening is to detect abnormalities\n    that point to the potential presence of cancer or pre-cancer prior to the individual starting to experience symptoms (1). Sounds optimal, right? The answer is yes, but only for some. As with many things in life, there is no “one-size-fits-all”\n    model when it comes to screening. The decision of whether to screen or not to screen depends on weighing the benefits and harms for individuals or groups (2-5). But what does the research have to say about different forms of cancer screening? Here\n    are just a few of the evidence-based insights on screening for prostate cancer, ovarian cancer, and breast cancer. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Screening for prostate cancer Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the prostate cells. The PSA test is used to assess the level of PSA in the blood, with high levels of PSA eluding to the potential presence of prostate cancer. Despite the wide-use of this test\n    as a method for prostate cancer screening, it is not deemed very reliable, and the Canadian Preventive Taskforce does not recommend its use as a screening tool. In particular, the PSA test is not advised for use in men under 55 and over 70 years of\n    age, while those aged 55 to 69 (the highest risk group) are directed to speak with a health professional about available screening options prior to opting for a PSA test. Why is that? Well, the benefits of the PSA test are not consistent, but the\n    harms—includingfalse positiveresults, complications associated with further tests undertaken to help reach a diagnosis\n    (e.g., biopsies), andoverdiagnosis—are\n noteworthy (2;3). These results relate to men who do not have symptoms of prostate cancer prior to screening. It is also important to mention that recommendations around using or not using PSA tests are not agreed upon by all experts (6). 2.Screening for ovarian cancer Transvaginal ultrasounds and/or cancer antigen 125 (CA-125) blood tests are two methods used to screen for ovarian cancer (4;7). The ultrasound takes images of the ovaries, while the blood test looks for high levels of the CA-125 protein. Research shows\n    that ovarian cancer screening does not decrease deaths from ovarian cancer in women who are over the age of 45, symptomless, and at “average risk” of the disease. However,false positivetest results have the potential to lead to unnecessary surgeries in this population (4). As such, both the US Preventive Services Task Force and the Canadian Preventive Taskforce do not recommend ovarian cancer\xa0screening in women with an “average risk”\n    of ovarian cancer who do not have symptoms (4;7-8). 3.Screening for breast cancer Mammography—or a mammogram—involves taking x-ray images of the breasts to screen for breast cancer (5;9-10). In women at “average risk” for breast cancer, mammography reduces the risk of death in those aged 50 to 69 years, but\n    not in those under 50 years old and between 70 and 74 years old. With that said, the findings for the under 50 and between 70 and 74 age groups are not as conclusive. What’s more, mammography, may also increase the risk ofoverdiagnosisin women under 50 years of age, as well as those between 50 and 69 years of age (4). Similar to PSA tests, varying opinions exist around the use mammography, specifically on issues such as which groups should be screened and when to initiate screening\n    (4;11-13). Please note that the results for ovarian and breast cancer screening \xa0are only relevant to people at ""average risk"" of those \xa0cancers, andNOThigh risk folks, while the results\n    for prostate cancer screening are relevant to men without symptoms of prostate cancer. Next to steps for you You might be thinking, “What does this mean for me?” and no one would blame you. Between some inconclusive results, differing findings by age group, and mixed-messaging by experts, it can be hard to tease out what is best for you. The good\n    news is you do not have to figure it all out on your own. Decisions around whether to screen, which screening option is best for you, and how to go about it should be made in consultation with your health care team. Together you can assess your level\n    of risk, weigh the benefits and harms for you as an individual, and incorporate your preferences.']"

From one country to another, from one community to another, and from one historical period to another, funeral rites help to overcome the death of a loved one by allowing mourning to begin, and this, while being surrounded by those close to them. Families bereaved during pandemics or violent events have more difficulty in grieving because the rites are disrupted or sometimes impossible to perform, which disrupts the grief and bereavement process. Without being able to count on the support of the community and without being able to pay homage to the deceased, these people are at risk of prolonged and complicated grief, post-traumatic stress disorder, and other mental health problems. Can rituals used in a therapeutic setting help people overcome prolonged and complicated grief? A systematic review of 22 studies examined rituals and symbolic interventions aimed at reducing the symptoms of prolonged and traumatic grief in different populations.(1) These people  experienced the death of a loved one in various circumstances: the death of a loved one by homicide or following a disappearance, a perinatal death, a genocide, elderly individuals who lose their life partner, professionals who are close to death (for example, police officers or personnel in palliative-care settings). Rituals used in  therapy for prolonged grief are sensory acts performed in a structured way and using symbols. Whether conducted in groups or alone, under the benevolent guidance of a therapist or independently, at home or in public places, ritual experiences create an alternate symbolic reality that allows one to express one's emotions in a controlled and safe environment. Different interventions are used in  therapeutic rituals: meditating, communicating symbolically with the deceased or an imaginary friend, writing a letter, reading religious texts or poems, keeping objects and images to remember the deceased, lighting up candles, or holding a farewell ceremony. The social aspect of the rituals, whether funerals or done as part of a therapeutic intervention, and the feeling of belonging to a community are one of the key functions of rituals in our society. Sharing grief is comforting and promotes cohesion and solidarity. Almost all studies show significant positive effects of following a\xa0therapy for prolonged grief, including rituals to decrease symptoms associated with prolonged grief, such as depression, post-traumatic distress, hopelessness and panic behaviours, intrusive thoughts and  loneliness. Additionally, some studies have reported improved memory, positive mood, personal growth, and integration of meaning. The review also reveals that some immigrants and members of ethnic minority groups often exhibit persistent symptoms of grief. One possible explanation is the lack of rituals, whether because of the inability to perform culturally appropriate rituals or the disconnect between the cultural customs of the host country and their own cultural traditions. In the first few months after the loss of a loved one, the normal symptoms of grief gradually begin to subside. However, if these symptoms persist or worsen, you may be experiencing prolonged and complicated grief. Signs and symptoms of prolonged and complicated grief can include:(2) If you have these symptoms, or if you know someone who is going through prolonged and complicated grief, get help. Programs and services exist to support those experiencing grief.Crisis Services Canadaprovides a list of crisis and counselling centres across the country (including local bereavement support groups).

Letâs talk music!,"['“Sleep is the best meditation."" – His Holiness the Dalai Lama One, two, three, four…one hundred. Have you ever spent a night counting sheep with the hopes of finally falling asleep? Do you sometimes get that much yearned for shut-eye but still wake up feeling unsatisfied or not well-rested? Are you finding\n    it hard to stay awake during hours that people do not typically spend sleeping? If you answered “yes” to one or more of these questions, know that you are not alone. Amongst Canadian adults, it is estimated that 1 in 2 face difficulties falling or staying asleep, 1 in 5 do not report that their sleep is refreshing, and\n    1 in 3 have a hard time staying awake during waking hours (1). Not getting good quality sleep can be detrimental to our health and well-being. Take, for example, older adults. In this population, poor sleep quality has the potential to increase the\n    risk of developing anxiety, depression, suicidal behaviours, cognitive issues, physical impairments, heart disease, diabetes, and immune disorders (2-6). Drug-based strategies, including those that alter mood, thinking, and behaviour, are often the first-line of treatment for sleep-related issues (2;7-9). Despite the heavy use of “sleeping pills,” due to the safety implications associated with\n    their use, non-drug treatment options—such as yoga and light therapy—are also available and under further exploration (2;7;9-13). Here, safety refers to the increased risk of illness/injury and death, as well as considerations around medication\n    tolerance and the potential for becoming dependent on medication (2;9). One common side effect of “sleeping pills” that especially impacts older adults is disorientation (7). Knowing the importance of sleep and the need forcomplementary or alternativenon-drug treatment options, let’s examine music as a possible strategy. You heard that right, music, something that we turn on in times celebration, when we need comfort, and for the purpose healing. But can music help improve sleep quality\n    in older adults? Arecentsystematic reviewprovides some answers (2). The review looked at studies that had participants generally just listening to music around bedtime/night time, although some engaged in music making as well. The music used varied, but a few examples include meditative music, western music (e.g., modern\n    jazz and classical), and Chinese music (e.g., classical). Participants were compared to those not using music-based strategies or medications, but instead engaging in other activities—such as maintaining a sleep log or receiving sleep promotion\n    or sleep hygiene education sessions. The review found that overall, sleep quality in older adults may be enhanced through the use of music-based strategies. Additionally, other components of sleep that may see improvements include sleep latency, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, and daytime\n    dysfunction. Breaking down some of the lesser known terms, sleep latency refers to the time it takes to go from being fully awake to fully asleep, sleep efficiency is the percentage of sleep time attained while in bed, and daytime dysfunction relates\n    to one’s perception of experiencing troubles with staying awake while completing daytime activities (e.g., driving) and maintaining enough enthusiasm to complete tasks. Although music-based strategies are generally considered to be safe, the\n    majority of the studies included in the review did not investigate safety. The only study that assessed safety reported no side effects or instances of discomfort. With music emerging as a potentially promising non-drug strategy, it should be noted that many of the results presented in the review were based on a small number of studies. As such, more large high quality studies are needed to further explore the benefits\n    and any adverse effects, as well as the optimal prescription for music-based strategies (e.g., type, duration, etc.) (2). If you are interested in trying out a music-based treatment to help with your sleep, consult your health care team for tips on how to incorporate and execute this strategy. A variety of free music made to intentionally relax you is available online through\n    platforms like YouTube to help you get started. Try out various songs/sounds/musical mixes and see what works for you. Be sure to pay attention to potential safety hazards such as headphones, opting for speakers instead, and volume control.']"

20,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2021/11/17/emotional-closeness-between-grandparents-and-grandchildren,17 November 2021,Emotional closeness between grandparents and grandchildren,"[""There are many grandparents and they play essential roles in our lives. In Canada, over 7.5 million people aged 45 and over are grandparents. (1) Most of us have lasting memories of times we spent with our grandparents during our childhood, but also during part of our adult life. Spending a weekend with grandparents was synonymous with freedom. Listening to them tell anecdotes about their youth or that of our parents was memorable. The shared laughter was a sign of a great bond. And what about sweets and a few pennies given in secret! There are different types of relationships between grandchildren and their grandparents. They can be instrumental in nature (for example, babysitting grandchildren, offering financial and material assistance) or emotional in nature (for example, listening to, consoling or counselling their grandchildren). Sometimes a unique bond develops between grandparents and their grandchildren. Such a positive and meaningful relationship is usually characterized by greater emotional closeness. A real bond of affection and trust is then established that goes beyond the filial bond and which emphasizes the pleasure of being together and unwavering support for others. But what factors can influence this emotional closeness, and what impact can it have on grandparents and grandchildren? A recent systematic review of 18 studies examined the emotional closeness between grandparents and their grandchildren, and its role in their respective lives.(2) Of note, the grandchildren in the studies were generally adolescents and young adults (11-25 years old). The systematic review reveals that emotional closeness is influenced by personal, relational and socio-cultural factors. The relationships between adult grandchildren and their grandparents can be strengthened through what is called intergenerational solidarity. Intergenerational solidarity is not just about getting news or giving out a birthday card. This solidarity implies mutual assistance which benefits both sides. For example, grandchildren sometimes become caregivers for their grandparents, teaching them how to use communication technologies or social media, for example. For their part, grandparents can pass on their experiences to them, be a financial support, play the role of confidant, support them unconditionally and take an interest in their concerns. Several behaviours promote greater emotional proximity: However, several factors can hinder this emotional closeness: lack of time, divorces, geographic distance between them, family conflicts and the independence of grandchildren who have become adults. The state of health of grandparents can also affect this connection, for example if they develop dementia. As if that weren't enough, the health context of the COVID-19 pandemic limited opportunities to see each other face to face, which isolated seniors. Some articles have reported effects of emotional closeness on the psychological and social development of participants. For example, emotional closeness affects the psychological well-being of grandchildren, and especially the coping skills of adolescents. Another study found that greater emotional closeness was associated with reduced emotional symptoms, reduced hyperactivity and increased prosocial behaviour of grandchildren. These results indicate that emotional closeness between grandchildren and grandparents may influence positive attitudes and well-being of grandchildren. As they age, grandchildren expand their social networks and connect with people outside of their family circles, which sometimes decreases the time spent with family members. Grandparents, on the other hand, sometimes see these social circles shrinking due to isolation, disease and mortality of loved ones, and desire to increase the time spent with living family members. It is therefore important to increase contacts in person or via social media, despite the geographic distance. These privileged moments will allow you to discuss, tell anecdotes, listen to each other, and support each other in difficult times. Most importantly, don't forget to tell them how much you love them.""]"

The most readily prescribed therapeutic strategy is medication (1). However, medication may not always be an effective option,\n    can come with undesirable or potentially serious side effects, and may be a financial burden for some (2-6). Fortunately, many non-drug treatments are available either as an alternative to medication or a complementary strategy to work alongside it.\n    But what does the research have to say about leaning on non-drug treatment strategies? Let’s explore the possible benefits and pitfalls through a few common conditions. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Agitation within dementia The vast majority of people with dementia—almost 90%—experience agitation (6;7). This behavioural issue negatively impacts multiple areas of a person’s life, including their relationships and ability to carry out everyday activities\n    (2;8). A number of medications are used to treat agitation. However, their effectiveness is often limited, and they come with the potential for serious risks, such as cognitive decline and heart-related complications (2;9-15). Research shows that\n    in adults with dementia, non-drug treatments including massage therapy, personally tailored interventions, animal-assisted interventions, and pet robot interventions may help decrease agitation by small to moderate amounts (6). 2.Depression within dementia Similarly, using medication to treat depression in people with dementia has also been questioned due to potential harms—such as falls, broken bones, and sleep disturbances—and in some cases (e.g., antidepressants) limited short-term effectiveness\n    (16;17). There are alternative options for those with dementia who are experiencing depressive symptoms but do not have an official depression diagnosis. Research illustrates that non-drug treatments including cognitive stimulation alone, cognitive\n    stimulation plus exercise and social interaction, massage and touch therapies, occupational therapy, multidisciplinary care, and reminiscence therapy may be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in this population. Certain non-drug treatments\n    also show the potential to be more effective than some medications (16). 3.High blood pressure High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, increases the risk of developing various health issues and dying prematurely (18). A diverse set of medications that aim to lower blood pressure are available and have been shown to be effective in many\n    people (3;19). With that said, there are still some folks that are unable to get their blood pressure under control with medication. Other factors that may have people looking for non-drug alternatives include the cost of medications and associated\n    side effects, such as kidney problems, fainting, and low blood pressure (3-5). Research demonstrates that certain dietary approaches, physical exercises, stress reducing practices, weight loss interventions, and comprehensive lifestyle modifications\n    can help reduce blood pressure in people with prehypertension to established hypertension (3). In particular, DASH—a dietary pattern that promotes the consumption of whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables and recommends decreasing\n    sodium, saturated fat, and total fat content—appears to be effective (3;20-21). 4.Urinary incontinence Urinary incontinence, more commonly understood as involuntary loss of bladder control, is a stressful condition that can impact everything from mental to social health (22-25). This condition is especially prevalent in older women (26). Both medication\n    and non-drug treatments exist to help women battle their bladder woes. However, it is generally recommended that women first try achieving success with non-drug treatments before moving to medications that are known to produce side effects, such as\n    constipation, headaches, and blurry vision (27). One non-drug treatment is pelvic floor muscle training, which has been shown to help cure or improve urinary incontinence in women with different subtypes of the condition (22). For those living with the conditions described above, you may be wondering where to go from here. If you are interested in trying a non-drug treatment, consult your health care team to inquire about all available treatment options for your condition,\n    as well as their advantages and disadvantages. Remember, do not stop taking prescribed medications without first consulting your health care team. With the help of health professionals, you can come to an evidence-informed decision about the best\n    strategy or combination of strategies for you, while also voicing and incorporating your needs, preferences, and concerns.']"

It was believed that aging was synonymous with health problems and physical decline. Fortunately, this negative perception has changed and  aging is now synonymous with well-being, personal development and social engagement. Today, sport is even seen as a tool for maintaining good physical shape, improving mental well-being and building social relationships. (1) Although the offer of sporting activities is greater than ever for older adults, the dominant discourse still emphasizes the need to take part in recreational sports, rather than competition, performance or victory. Some age-related stereotypes still persist, and we are more concerned with the risk of falls and injury in older athletes than with their performance.(1; 2) And yet, several sports federations at the provincial, national and international levels organize competitions for older athletes (also referred as ""veterans"" or ""masters""). One notable example is the “World Masters Games”, the largest multi-sport event welcoming up to 30,000 athletes every four years. This event dedicated to older athletes has experienced an explosive growth since its first event in 1985. Nearly 30 team and individual sports are offered at this event, including weightlifting, track and field, tennis, basketball, swimming, field hockey and rugby. Not to mention the ""Winter World Masters Games"", which typically include winter sports such as ice hockey, curling and cross-country skiing.(3) Given this growing interest, what is known about the factors influencing older athletes to take part in competitive sports? A recent systematic review of 69 studies looked at older adults (aged 50 and over) who participate in competitive sports.(1) The studies looked at a wide variety of sports  such as athletics, swimming, cycling, triathlon, tennis,  basketball, and hockey. Research has shown that there are four types of factors that influence the participation of older athletes in competitive sports: 1. Personal factors Contrary to popular belief that older adults who participate in sport only do it for recreational purposes, older athletes who participate in sporting events appear to have a strong competitive spirit. In fact, this personality trait seems to encourage them to train more to beat their personal bests while comparing themselves to other people of the same age. In addition, competitive sports  provides them with increased general well-being, greater endurance in the face of pain, better acceptance of aging, a feeling of autonomy and pleasure, while reducing anxiety and depression. 2. Interpersonal factors The ""entourage"" of older athletes - that is, family, friends, teammates and coaches - has a great deal of importance in their desire to participate in competitive sports. They are proud of their athlete status and the recognition they get. They also enjoy being a role model for children and youth, as well as playing sports with members of their family. Sporting events are also an opportunity to strengthen social bonds with other athletes, not only during competition, but also during training. Friendships that are forged through participation in sport encourage the pursuit of this activity. 3. Environmental and community factors Beyond socialization and friendship, participation in competitive sports strengthens a sense of belonging to a group or community. It should also be noted, however, that the  environment in which older athletes live can facilitate or hinder their participation in competitive sports, including the availability and access to facilities, and the costs associated with a specific sport. 4. Factors related to existing policies Studies show that older athletes are not a priority group in  policies adopted by sports federations and governments, which typically focus on the development of young athletes to achieve peak performance. The authors of the review therefore highlight the importance of developing policies that  encourage, support and develop older athletes. Whether you are a recreational or competitive athlete, whether you have done it before or not, the benefits of being active are undeniable! Choose carefully:There is a sport adapted to your situation, your age, your health status, and your personal preferences. Talk to your health professionalto make sure a sport is or is not appropriate for your condition. If you want to compete,surround yourself with professionals (and loved ones)to help you prepare physically and mentally, and to achieve your goals. Check the websites of  provincial, national and international sports federationsto learn more about the support offered to older athletes, or upcoming competitions near you. And of course, have fun!']"

Amongst those battling breast cancer, 1 in 33 will lose their life to this disease (1). As with other cancers, early detection is important for the development and execution of a\n    treatment plan and for better patient and treatment outcomes. One way to screen for breast cancer is by taking x-ray images of the breasts—a method known as mammography or getting a mammogram (2;3). Various considerations, such as the evidence on potential benefits and harms, go into formulating guidelines and recommendations for screening. For instance, arecentsystematic reviewon the effects of inviting versus not inviting women to mammography\n    screening was undertaken to help inform European guidelines on breast cancer. The review specifically looked at women with an average risk for breast cancer in three age categories: women less than 50 years old, women between 50 and 69 years old,\n    and women between 70-74 years old. Here, average risk was defined as having no family history of breast cancer or inherited mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes (4). Let’s lay out the findings relevant to the different age groups. The review left us with several takeaways, including illustrating the impact of mammography on risk of death from breast cancer, likelihood of overdiagnosis, and psychological distress. It should be noted that these resultsDO NOTapply to women who are at higher risk for breast cancer. In women aged 50 to 69 who are at average risk for breast cancer, mammography screening can reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer. One way to understand this reduction in risk is by looking at how many fewer women will die in this age group. In\n    this case, out of 100,000 women invited to screen, on average, between 138 and 483 fewer women will die from breast cancer. For those under 50 or between 70 and 74 years old, screening does not appear to reduce the risk of death from breast cancer.\n    However, because the balance between the pros and cons of screening is not as clear for those under 50 and between 70 and 74, the results are deemed inconclusive for these two groups. Next up, there is the issue of overdiagnosis, which refers to a situation where mammograms find cancers that will not go on to harm a woman during her lifetime (e.g., cancers that produce no symptoms, stop growing, or disappear on their own). Since we\n    cannot determine which cancers will go on to be harmless at the time of diagnosis, overdiagnosis has the potential to lead to women receiving unnecessary harmful treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. In both women under 50 and\n    between 50 and 69 years of age, mammography may increase the likelihood of overdiagnosis. To better understand this, we can compare the number of deaths avoided by screening to the number of women that will be diagnosed with a cancer that will not\n    go on to harm them. In the case of these two age groups, for every breast cancer-related death that screening helps to avoid, approximately four more woman will be overdiagnosed. Lastly, the review also found that false positive test results—meaning\n    those that detect the presence of breast cancer when it is not there—may increase the risk of distress, especially when a biopsy is then required. It should be noted, however, that the findings on psychological impacts are based on very low\n    to low certainty evidence, meaning it is likely these results could change as more research becomes available (4). Interestingly, despite the widespread use of mammography, various global and national health organizations do have differing recommendations around its use, some of which do not align with the findings of this review. These differences include at which\n    age to initiate screening and which groups should be screened vs. those that should not (4-7). Given the potential for mixed messaging, it is vital that women speak with their health care provider about their personal risk for developing breast cancer, as well as their values, preferences, and concerns. Together, they can weigh the benefits and\n    harms of mammography and consider all relevant factors to come to a decision about if and when screening should start and at what frequency.

There is no age to learn a new language. Whether it\'s to further your education, to advance your career, to travel, to forge bonds, or to learn and nourish yourself from another culture. The benefits of learning a new language are numerous and can even have repercussions on aging.(1) Indeed, several researchers are examining whether learning a new language can improve the quality of life of older adults and delay the onset of severe cognitive impairment. A recent systematic review of seven studies examined the effects of learning a new language on cognitive abilities in healthy older adults.(2) Despite some methodological shortcomings, such as the absence of control groups or differences in the intervention period, these studies reveal that learning a new language helps to maintain or improve cognitive abilities. Formal language classes have been shown to improve working memory, while playful activities to learn a new language have positive effects on attention. Bilingual individuals who learn a third language perform better in certain tasks, compared to unilingual individuals who learn a second language as adults. Language classes and related activities, such as group discussions, reading, games, YouTube videos or singing in a foreign language, are easy activities to perform and are stimulating for older adults. The effect is positive on general wellbeing, including emotional wellbeing. Findings showed that older adults who learn another language feel more optimistic, confident, and proud. In addition, in-person classes are great opportunities to socialize, to build strong social bonds among learners, and can foster greater integrating into society. Moreover, the positive cognitive effects of learning another language are due in part to the stimulation of social wellbeing. Several resources are available to help you learn a new language: Register for a course:Many language courses are offered online.

There is a laundry list of things that we know are good for our health and well-being. But even with this knowledge in hand, many of us find them hard to do consistently or at all.\n    Exercise at all or in sufficient quantity is one of those things that many know they should do but struggle to do. To be more precise, 1.4 billion adults around the world do not get enough exercise. That’s more than 25% of the adult population\n    or 1 in 4 adults (1). What is helping to fuel these numbers and hindering us from meeting recommended levels of physical activity? As a refresher, adults are encouraged to engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise (e.g., a brisk walk, cycling,\n    jogging) per week and incorporate muscle strengthening activities into their routine at least two times per week (1;2). Factors that influence exercise behaviours include: not having enough time, social support, lack of energy, willpower, skill, and\n    resources, and fear of injury (3). Those living with disorders that impact their bones, spine, muscles, and other soft tissues are especially likely to be inactive. Osteoporosis, osteopenia, back pain, rheumatoid arthritis, and gout are just a few of the over 150 conditions that fit this\n    bill (4-6). The lack of activity in this group is unfortunate, given that exercise may help some better manage symptoms and improve health outcomes, while not engaging in exercise can do the opposite (7-10). Take, for example, those living with rheumatoid\n    arthritis. Fear of injury, which in this case means causing further damage to joints, lack of energy, which translates into fatigue, and pain are factors that push people away from exercise (7-13). However, research shows that exercise may help folks\n    living with this inflammatory condition improve indicators of fitness and inflammation, as well as walking time, fatigue, and physical function (7). Does a strategy exist to help people living with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases and conditions increase the amount of exercise they engage in? Let's turn our attention to wearable activity trackers, as well asthesystematic reviewthat took on learning about their effects in this population (4). The review looked at people with osteoarthritis, low-back pain, or a chronic inflammatory rheumatic disease using an activity tracker worn on their wrist or waist. Trackers ranged from simple pedometers to more advanced technologies, such as those that\n    allow you to automatically relay information and connect to an app. Alongside the wearable activity tracker, most people participating in the studies included in the review also engaged in or received complementary strategies such as goal setting,\n    educational walking booklets, and counselling. These folks were compared to those who were either: inactive, received education or usual care only, used a tracker alone with no other strategy, or used a tracker in combination with some other complementary\n    strategy. Although more research is needed on the long-term use of wearable trackers, as well as the best complementary strategies to pair them with, the review did find some promising results. Frist, in people living with rheumatic and musculoskeletal diseases, adherence to consistently wearing activity trackers appears high. For instance, those using wrist trackers wore them 93% of the time for 10 weeks, which is a good first step. Second,\n    wearable activity trackers may increase the number of daily steps taken by a large amount (e.g., 1,520 more steps per day). Third, the time spent engaging in moderate to vigorous activity may also increase by a small amount (e.g., 16 more minutes\n    per day). What’s more, the increase in activity associated with short-term use of wearable activity trackers (up to 8 weeks) does not appear to come with worsening pain, disability, functioning, quality of life, or fatigue. However, a small\n    increase in pain may occur with long-term use (more than 8 weeks) of wearable activity trackers. In terms of advanced trackers vs. simple pedometers, a limited amount of data shows better outcomes with the use of more innovative technologies (4). Exercise is a feature of focus in guidelines that outline management and treatment options for rheumatic and/or musculoskeletal diseases, therefore signifying its importance (4;14-16). If you have been diagnosed with a rheumatic and/or musculoskeletal\n    condition and are struggling to stay active, you may want to consider the support of a wearable activity tracker. Talk to your health care team about if and how you can safely incorporate both physical activity and wearable devices into your daily\n    life and in a tailored way that meets the needs of your specific condition and abilities.""]"

29,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2021/10/06/barriers-to-cancer-care-in-nursing-homes,6 October 2021,Barriers to cancer care in nursing homes,"['It is common to hear that cancer develops slowly in older adults, or that the side effects of treatment do not justify subjecting them to treatments. Stopping cancer screening programs at a certain age, often around age 75, does not mean that older adults are less likely to develop cancer. The reality, however, is that the incidence of developing cancer increases with age and that untreated cancer can have negative effects on the quality of life. After a certain age, it is true that screening does not necessarily reduce cancer-related mortality and that the harms may outweigh the potential benefits, but it must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.(1-2) Thanks to treatments and other therapeutic innovations, cancer has become somewhat of a chronic disease. The fact remains that the management of cancer cases in nursing homes is a major challenge. As the end of life approaches, whether it is a lack of resources or difficulty communicating with patients with dementia, it can be difficult to provide the medical care required to treat cancer (for example, surgery , biopsy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy) and the side effects are more noticeable. Knowing that certain cancer treatments can lead to functional decline and excess mortality in the elderly, the therapeutic strategy is often oriented towards comfort care rather than curative care, which improves the quality of life of patients whose life expectancy is short or already living with other health issues, for example. When cancer is detected and older adults wish to obtain treatments, they are often transferred to a hospital, which brings its share of anxiety, loss of autonomy, and health risks (especially among frail older adults). How can we make decisions that seek to balance the potential benefits and harms of cancer treatment in older adults living in nursing homes? A recent and moderate-quality systematic review of 65 studies identified the barriers associated with cancer treatment in older adults in nursing homes.(3) Despite the diversity of studies and certain methodological weaknesses, several barriers to cancer care in nursing homes have been identified, linked in particular to organizational, cultural and ethical barriers, but also to a lack of  knowledge among nursing home staff. Despite the high prevalence of this disease in the elderly, early diagnosis seems to be neglected in nursing homes compared to screening recommendations, whether for lack of willingness to perform the necessary tests, the inability to identify signs of cancer during daily care (for example, lesions on the skin or in the mouth), the trivialization of symptoms experience by residents, or the complexity of arranging tests and appointments for nursing home residents. Ageism is also a cultural barrier that limits access to specific cancer care, often considered as being too invasive, a source of deterioration in quality of life and therapeutic obstinacy. However, when asked for their opinion and when they are able to consent, older patients often accept cancer treatments as much as younger patients, but when they do, it is because they have assessed that benefits outweighed harms: they are not ready to trade their survival for their quality of life. Whether you are an older adult residing in a nursing home, a family caregiver or health professional, it is important to discuss and identify  symptoms, to know the screening possibilities adapted to different health conditions, and to get the full picture of the side effects and potential benefits of existing treatments. To improve the quality of life for residents, professionals working in nursing homes would benefit from continuing education in oncogeriatrics to keep up to date on cancer screening, possible treatments, communication with residents that have  cognitive impairments, etc. Such training would help to guarantee any elderly cancer patient access to treatments adapted to their condition through a multidisciplinary and multiprofessional approach.']"

This translates into 1 in 4 people living with this invisible and often debilitating condition that reduces their quality of life (1-3). Neuropathic pain, more simply referred to as nerve pain, is one type of pain that contributes to these case numbers. Nerve pain is caused by damage to the nerves (2). Damage can stem from a variety of injuries, conditions, and diseases—such as diabetes, a bout of shingles, and brain injuries (2;4). Unfortunately, for those experiencing the tingling, burning, and stabbing sensations that accompany a nerve pain diagnosis, relief is not easy to come by (2). Despite the availability of numerous drug-based treatment options—including medications such as opioids, anti-seizure drugs, and antidepressants—it is reported that partial pain relief is only successfully attained by 40% to 60% of people (2;6). These lackluster results, coupled with the side effects associated with medication use, help us to better understand why people living with nerve pain often look tocomplementary and alternativestrategies (2;6-9). One such strategy is herbal treatments. Just like any treatment option, however, it is good to do your homework first to find out if the treatment is effective and if there are any harmful side effects to be aware of. The same is true for herbal treatments. Arecentsystematic reviewset out to do just that (2). The review investigated the use of herbal treatments in adults with moderate nerve pain and ended up including only two small studies. These studies specifically looked at nutmeg applied topically (i.e., to the skin) via a spray and St John’s wort taken orally in tablet form. They both also allowed the continued use of painkillers. Very low-quality evidence demonstrates that neither herbal treatment decreases pain compared to placebo. Breaking these findings down further shows that nutmeg does not appear to provide meaningful pain relief of 30% or greater. Similarly, St John’s wort was also not shown to reduce total pain scores. In terms of safety, both people using herbal treatments and the placebo reported minor side effects; there was no significant difference in the number of side effects experienced between the two groups. Eye pain and headaches and temporary and tolerable burning or stiffness were reported by those using nutmeg. Itching, dry mouth, sweating, nausea, stomach pain, fatigue, and diarrhea were reported by those using St John’s wort. However, these findings were also based on very low-quality evidence. People looking for relief may be wondering how they should interpret these results, given the limited number of studies and the quality of the evidence. Ultimately, when looking at the whole picture, we are left with a lot of uncertainty about both the benefits and possible harms associated with nutmeg and St John’s wort. This means that, currently, we cannot draw conclusions on their effectiveness and safety; and that their use should be approached with caution until more research is available (2). Consult your health care team about your interest in using herbal treatments before starting. This allows for an examination of potential side effects and interactions with other medications, as well as a comprehensive conversation of all the traditional and complementary or alternative treatment options available.']"

However, the solutions proposed to deal with these problems do not always achieve consensus. Among the range of solutions, some are based on technological advances that allow us to glimpse the contours of the cities of tomorrow, which could be smart and safer.So-called “smart” technologies are already used in different spheres of our lives. We are talking about electronic devices, generally connected to other devices or networks via wireless protocols. These devices can operate interactively and autonomously to some extent (for example, smart phones, smart vehicles, smart thermostats, smart doorbells, smart locks, smart fridges, smart watches, etc.). The term can also refer to a device that can use artificial intelligence.Smart technologies are also used at the city level. A city is said to be smart when it uses information and communication technologies to improve the efficiency of urban services, as well as the quality of life of citizens. Such a city uses different electronic data collection sensors to provide information to manage its services and resources optimally. This includes data from citizens, devices in urban infrastructure, traffic and transport systems, power plants, water supply networks, waste management systems, or information systems in schools, libraries and health facilities.(1)These smart technologies can also identify hazards and respond to them effectively. Some studies also suggest that smart cities could reduce crime by 30% to 40%, or even speed up the response time of emergency services by 30% to 35%.(2) But what is the research telling us about security technologies used in smart cities? A moderate-quality systematic review identified 121 studies exploring the types of new security technologies used in smart cities.(1) Three main themes emerged from the analysis of these studies:1. New sensors, traditional actuatorsCertain technologies have long been used to prevent crime and are aimed at the detection of anomalies, threats and delinquent or criminal behaviour. We can think of video surveillance. When a threat is detected, the police are automatically called in for assistance.What is new is the ability to manage threats without human intervention, through drones or autonomous vehicles, or environmental modification. For example, a sensor that recognizes abnormal movement could turn on nearby streetlights or sound an audible alarm, rather than triggering a police response.Obviously, this involves the large-scale deployment of sensors and actuators (the autonomous responses to control threats).2. Making old systems smartSmart cities are not always built from scratch. Older systems that work well and are already in place can be improved or automated.For example, in the simple case of video surveillance, the space available to house the captured data should be increased, especially if the number of sensors is increased. In addition, a human operator can monitor a limited number of cameras, hence the need to automate detection and analysis using artificial intelligence, which will also make it possible to react more quickly in the event of danger.3. Completely new functionsThese new functions are aimed at disseminating mass information and forecasting trends or events. To achieve this, mobile applications would be developed to collect information on criminal activity and public disturbances or to share information related to crime prevention. Citizens could directly report a crime through apps. However, citizens will need to actively use these apps to generate enough data.In addition, precautions must be taken to prevent certain citizens from reporting false crimes or taking the opportunity to complain about their neighbours, which would clog the police services and delay their response to urgent events. Smart cities may hold promise for increasing the level of security (and possibly people\'s sense of security).However, they also raise important issues. These include concerns about the collection of personal information without consent, as well as risks to autonomy and privacy. The massive installation of sensors and other intelligent devices in the urban space can cause fear among many citizens who see in these the emergence of ""Big Brother"" (that is to say a surveillance system with control purposes via, for example, facial recognition, predictive policing, or real-time social media monitoring).Another important issue is the very security of smart technologies. Indeed, smart cities face cybersecurity risks. Just think of the risks of intrusions into computer systems, the illicit manipulation of these systems, or the massive leakage of personal data.The introduction of smart technologies into urban spaces can greatly disrupt the lives of citizens. Smart cities must position their citizens at the very heart of their information system. Citizens must therefore have a say in the deployment of smart technologies.And you, are you ready for this new era?']"

Caregivers can play an important role in the discharge process,"['In Canada, millions of people are hospitalized each year. Between 2019 and 2020, over three million individuals were admitted to hospitals with an acute disease, illness, or medical condition—such as heart attack, heart failure, bronchitis, or pneumonia (1). During the admittance process, key information is collected and documented. This important step helps to ensure that patients receive the appropriate type and level of care while in hospital. Similar efforts are needed at discharge to ensure patients seamlessly receive the care they need at home or in the community to continue their recovery. There is a lot to consider for effective discharge planning, including determining where the patient’s next stop is (e.g., home) after their stay at a hospital or other advanced health care facility, as well as what is needed for them to transition there safely and within a timely manner (2). Research has shown that providing quality transitions through tailored discharge planning and transitional care programs/interventions can: reduce the length of hospital stays, hospital readmissions, use of unnecessary home care services, and admissions to long-term care homes; increase the use of primary-care services; and enhance the patient’s health outcomes (5-10). On the other hand, when the transition process is mismanaged, there is a risk of the patient experiencing interruptions in care, harm due to mistakes, and worsening symptoms. Both patients and caregivers can also endure emotional distress (11-24). Caregivers have reported that their needs are often not met and have expressed disappointment with the discharge planning process. This is concerning given that informal caregivers, especially those caring for older adults, are providing quite complex care—such as medication management, the use of medical equipment, and wound maintenance (2;25). In addition to these tasks, caregivers also assist patients with completing activities of daily living, and can provide vital knowledge into the patient and their medical condition to the health care team (26-28). Is it possible that greater engagement of caregivers in discharge planning could support improved care in the community and ultimately better outcomes for patients?Onesystematic reviewtook a closer look at the effects of including caregivers of older adults in hospital-discharge planning (2). The review found three potential benefits to including caregivers in hospital-discharge planning. First, this strategy can help to reduce the risk of older adults being re-admitted to the hospital. More specifically, the risk may be reduced by 9% to 38% three months after discharge and by 10% to 36% at six months post-discharge. Generally, studies also reported that including caregivers in discharge planning may reduce the length of rehospitalizations, as well as cost of care following discharge.\xa0These results underscore the importance of caregivers having a “seat at the table” when it comes to decision-making related to the discharge of their loved one from the hospital (2). If you are a caregiver to a hospitalized older adult, it is important to get involved in discharge planning. With the patient’s consent, you can play an integral role in the care team as an advocate for the values, needs, and preference of both the patient and yourself (26; 28). This may seem daunting, but resources exist to help you navigate conversations by increasing your awareness of what questions to ask and information to seek.

Are you worried about being prejudiced and discriminated against when seeking care? If so, you are not alone!Studies show that older LGBTQI women experience more discrimination than men because they find themselves in a “triple minority” situation, based on their gender, age and sexual orientation.The obstacles encountered by older LGBTQI women are numerous: homophobia, heterosexism, providers lacking knowledge about health issues affecting older LGBTQI women, bad experiences with a provider, poor quality of care, lack of access to (or unnecessary) screening tests (for example, in terms of screening for sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections, pregnancy tests).It appears that many care providers are uncomfortable with issues related to the sexuality and gender of LGBTQI women, as well as staff in nursing homes and other residents often viewing homosexual relationships negatively. In this context, it is not surprising that older LGBTQI women express a desire to obtain accommodation services and care that are inclusive and adapted to their realities.But how can we redefine health and social care to make them more accessible to older LGBTQI women? A systematic review of 18 studies examined the views and experiences of 830 older LGBTQI women in accessing health and social care.(1)Four major themes were identified from the analysis:1. The disclosure dilemmaLGBTQI women may feel uncomfortable disclosing their gender identity or sexual orientation to care providers, their employer, and co-workers. Often, they fear homophobic attitudes, rejection, negative effects on the progression of their career, refusal to treat them. Some will even hide their orientation or wait before seeking care. These reactions have negative consequences on their health and well-being: necessary treatments may be delayed, lower self-esteem, depression.2. A sense of belongingIn times of need, older LGBTQI women can mostly rely on their partner and the LGBTQI community for care or support. Unfortunately, many friends and family members do not accept the LGBTQI reality, which leads to breakdowns in their relationships and greater social isolation.3. Care is not inclusiveOverall, the majority of studies have found that care lacks inclusiveness to meet the needs of older LGBTQI women. For example, many provider take it for granted that everyone is heterosexual, are unfamiliar with the needs of lesbian women or non-binary people, and are uncomfortable with aspects of gynecological and sexual health of LGBTQI women. This compromises needs assessment and can lead to ordering unnecessary tests.4. Facing various axes of oppression and discriminationIn addition to discrimination based on their sexual orientation and gender identity, older LGBTQI women may face various axes of oppression and discrimination based on their ethnocultural background, socio-economic status and their age. For example, they may be victims of prejudices associated with poverty, have difficulty accessing resources due to financial difficulties, especially if they live in remote regions. We are not all equal when it comes to aging. Older LGBTQI women face significant challenges. Several changes appear necessary, including:- better training of professionals and the establishment of programs specifically designed for older LGBTQI women to help them stay healthy, active and engaged for as long as possible; and- accreditation programs for professionals and institutions to ensure that the care they deliver is adapted to their specific needs.']"

Consuming a well-balanced diet that’s rich in essential nutrients plays an important role in aging optimally. But with busy schedules, potential financial barriers, and competing health demands, for some, if not many of us, this may feel like a tall order at times (1). So, our ears ""perk up"" at the sound of seemingly “easy” solutions to our health concerns or strategies that require low effort while still helping us achieve our health goals. The use of dietary supplements is one such strategy. These supplements line the physical and virtual shelves of our grocery stores, health food stores, and pharmacies; and have been successfully marketed as a key part of our health and wellness journeys (2). Despite often overinflated promises doled out via advertising, evidence to support the use of dietary supplements for the prevention and treatment of various conditions or the promotion of overall health is not always so cut and dry (2-16). Sometimes it’s encouraging, but often within specific contexts such as in the case of vitamin D and diabetes or respiratory tract infections, and other times it’s lacking and calls for more research, such as in the case of cancer or dementia prevention. Results vary based on the population, type of supplement, and outcome being studied (3-16). Cardiovascular (heart or blood vessel) diseases contribute to a significant proportion of global deaths. In 2019 alone, cardiovascular diseases were responsible for almost 18 million lives lost. Digging deeper into the data, we see that over 15 million of these deaths were directly related to heart attack and stroke (17). Currently, there is no consensus around the use of specific vitamin and mineral supplements for the prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, yet use amongst the public remains high. Arecentsystematic reviewtook on the task of reviewing the evidence on the role of supplements in lowering the risk for heart attack, stroke, or death due to cardiovascular diseases (2). So, should the results raise our heart rate; in a good way? The findings may make people looking to protect their heart health pause before placing a supplement bottle in their shopping cart. Overall, it was found that commonly used supplements—such as vitamins D and C, calcium, and multivitamins—do not appear to reduce the risk for total cardiovascular disease, heart attack, or stroke, compared to no supplement use. What’s more, there was also no reduction in death from cardiovascular disease, heart attack, stroke, or any cause. The evidence ranged from very low to high certainty depending on the outcome, meaning that future research could change the results for some outcomes but likely not others. For instance, the finding that vitamin D did not reduce the risk of death by any cause was the only one based on high-quality evidence, allowing us to be very confident in this particular result. The following vitamins and minerals may also have no effect on cardiovascular outcomes: antioxidants, beta-carotene, iron, magnesium, selenium, vitamin A, vitamin B3 (niacin), vitamin B6, vitamin E, and zinc. However, it should be noted that the consumption of antioxidants and niacin (with a statin) may increase the risk of death from any-cause. There were some positive results worth noting, however. Specifically, the use of folic acid may reduce the risk for total cardiovascular disease and stroke, while B-complex vitamins (in which folic acid was also a component) may reduce the risk for stroke. With that said, these results need to be considered carefully and with additional information. Although the individual studies included within the review took place in countries all over the world, the positive results were driven by one large study from China. Unlike in North America, where foods are fortified with folic acid, China does not routinely do the same. This means that we cannot be sure that the benefits seen in the study from China would translate to other countries that supplement food with folic acid. Where does this leave us? Ultimately, back to where we started the conversation, stressing the importance of consuming a healthy and balanced diet that allows you to get all of your needed vitamins and minerals without the use of supplements. A diet rich in plant-based sources is likely to help most people (unless they have specific underlying conditions that require the use of supplements) achieve this (2). Refer toCanada’s food guidefor guidance on healthy eating and/or consult with your health care team. If you do choose to incorporate supplements into your diet, make sure it is a joint decision with your health care team, as not all supplements are safe for all people.']"

Through their engagement and wisdom, they contribute to their own wellbeing, but also to the wellbeing of children, youth, families and the entire community.The holistic approach of Indigenous cultures carries meaning and hope: through its contribution to intergenerational solidarity, the social engagement of Indigenous elders can help meet health and wellness needs.(1)But what does research tell us about the different ways that Indigenous elders can contribute to individual and collective wellbeing in their community? A recent moderate-quality systematic review examined the effects of the social engagement of Indigenous elders on individual and community well-being.(1) Partners working in health centres or band councils and Indigenous elders from eight of the eleven aboriginal nations in Quebec made it possible to find relevant documents that could not have been found using conventional scientific research methods. While the review was designed to include any Indigenous sources, the search was limited to documents in English and French, as well as to the Canadian context, for feasibility reasons. In total, 144 documents were included in the review.The analysis found that Indigenous elders contribute to wellbeing through:• their relationships and interactions with community members and with non-natives;• oral and written intergenerational communications;• engagement in community, social and civic life;• volunteering and employment; and• family life.The contributions of elders target young people, families and communities, thus promoting intergenerational solidarity, notably by:• sharing traditional knowledge and teaching indigenous languages;• caring for grandchildren and promoting family-conflict resolution;• integrating traditional healing practices in health centres and imparting traditional knowledge;• promoting positive individual and collective attitudes and behaviours such as reciprocity, resilience, anger management, perseverance, or dignity;• strengthening social cohesion;• supporting interventions to prevent disease and promote mental and physical health; and• promoting the acceptability of health and social services. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected all areas of our lives. For children and youth, the pandemic also had a significant impact with school closures (among other things). Students had to turn to remote learning (behind their screens) which may have contributed to feelings of isolation, loneliness, anxiety, and more.(2; 3)However, some indigenous communities have relied on land-based learning activities during the pandemic. By relying on elders, these communities were able to offer experiential learning activities outside the classroom. It was an opportunity to capitalize on culture and traditional practices in order to overcome the challenges of the pandemic.(4; 5)Such an example reflects the importance of intergenerational relationships, but also the fundamental role that elders can have in sharing their knowledge and contributing to the wellbeing of their community. Land-based learning is also a promising practice that could inspire school boards to help educators work in partnership with local Indigenous communities and elders to explore outdoor activities that integrate Indigenous knowledge with environmental education.(4)']"

But as the saying goes, “Knowledge is power.” Therefore, seeking out information to help you stay up to date on the condition that you or a loved one is working to manage, as well as the diverse treatment options available, can help to quell worries, encourage reflection on needs and preferences, and assist with making informed decisions. Take, for example, the case with rheumatoid arthritis. Rheumatoid arthritis is a disease marked by chronic inflammation (1;2). It causes fatigue and joint pain, stiffness, and swelling; and generally worsens over time (1;3-6). Eventually, rheumatoid arthritis can lead to joints becoming deformed and damaged (3;5-6). Together, these symptoms and complications reduce physical function, increase the risk for disability, impact a person’s ability to act independently, and lower quality of life (1;3-7). Be it disease progression or function, a variety of drug and non-drug treatments that aim to alleviate, slow, or prevent symptoms and complications and improve certain aspects of health and well-being do exist (1;3;8-9). One of which is exercise (1;3). Unfortunately, the role and significance of exercise within a rheumatoid arthritis treatment plan does not appear to be clear to patients and their caregivers (3). When we loop back to our earlier discussion of barriers, it becomes more clear why. The almost 20 million individuals with rheumatoid arthritis worldwide—including over 370 thousand Canadians—and their caregivers are no strangers to experiencing barriers like fear and lack of information (3;10-12). Here, fear relates to the fear of causing further joint damage, and lack of information is linked to not knowing enough about exercise as a treatment option (3;11-12). Combine these with symptoms and complications associated with the disease, and we have an environment that can make it easy to justify not engaging in exercise. With the help of arecentsystematic review, gaps in knowledge about different exercise options and their effects may be addressed for people with rheumatoid arthritis and their caregivers. (3). This evidence may go on to help patients, and their caregivers, come to a decision about if and how to incorporate exercise into the treatment plan. The review looked at adults with rheumatoid arthritis engaging in aerobic exercise, strength training, aerobic exercise plus strength training, aquatic exercise, or hand exercise. These folks were compared to those completing other types of exercise, mobility exercise, usual care, or on a waitlist (meaning study participants were on a list waiting to engage in exercise but not yet doing so). Evidence ranging in quality from very low to moderate suggests that exercise may help to improve some symptoms and outcomes related to rheumatoid arthritis. Let’s breakdown the results of the three exercise types that yielded benefits. First up, we have aerobic exercise, which includes: cycling, walking on a treadmill, rowing, tai chi, and more. Overall, this form of exercise showed the potential to improve one outcome by a large amount, and that’s aerobic capacity. Aerobic capacity is an indicator of how well our body uses oxygen when we are exercising at full-intensity. It can speak to our fitness level and risk for a variety of diseases, including heart disease. Second in line, we have strength training. This type of exercise demonstrated that it may improve three symptoms and outcomes, namely pain and erythrocyte sedimentation rate by moderate amounts, and 50-foot walking time by a small amount. For those unfamiliar, erythrocyte sedimentation rate is an indicator of inflammation. Last up, we have combined aerobic exercise and strength training, which appeared to provide small improvements in fatigue and physical function. Although more research that enhances the quality of the evidence and provides specific prescriptions around the frequency, intensity, and duration of exercise is needed, currently, exercise seems to hold some promise for people with rheumatoid arthritis (3). Patients, in collaboration with their caregivers and health care professionals, should consider needs (e.g., symptoms of concern), preferences (e.g., exercises they find enjoyable and comfortable), and safety (e.g., physical limitations, disease status, etc.) when deciding on the most appropriate exercise type(s) to incorporate into a treatment plan.']"

This has been driven, in part, by residents being more at risk for serious and life-threatening health concerns from COVID-19. It has also been made worse by long-standing issues in long-term care homes that have been left unaddressed (for example, staffing problems and outdated buildings).(1; 2)This has led to the development of several recommendations to strengthen the sector.(1; 3; 4) Making greater use of technology has been identified as a potential solution to help address some of the biggest problems in long-term care and to improve the health and well-being of residents. Technology may have various benefits, such as:- helping residents who travel around the facility (for example, door sensors);- promoting social interaction among residents (for example by delivering social programming online);- facilitating virtual visits with care providers, caregivers, families and friends (for example through video calls);- facilitate communication between facilities, and between the various care providers (for example, through electronic health-record systems);- help to monitor the safety of residents (for example, global positioning systems (GPS) to locate wandering residents, health monitors, emergency response devices, and devices to monitor the usage of appliances);- touchless hardware and voice-activated devices (for example, asking “Google” or “Alexa” to call the nurse and/or front-desk staff, and activate features in rooms such as lights, blinds, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, and entertainment); and- artificial intelligence (for example, to support early disease detection, more precise diagnosis, and personalized treatments, or to continuously\xa0detect changes\xa0in activity and\xa0behaviour\xa0patterns for early detection of health issues).(1; 5; 6)Figure 1 below describes some of the types of technologies that could be used in long-term care homes. Figure 1: Types of technologies in long-term care homes(7) With governments moving to address many of the concerns that have received attention during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is a unique opportunity to examine the potential of technology to strengthen long-term care homes. This blog post is the first in a series which examine evidence and experiences related to the role of technology in long-term care homes in Canada. Several factors make it hard to identify and harness the potential of technology in long-term care homes, including:- residents of long-term care homes have complex health and social needs;- there are many long-standing issues in the long-term care sector across Canada; and- the full potential of technology isn’t being used to address these issues and to improve the quality of life for residents, caregivers and their families.Residents of long-term care homes have complex health and social needsIt is estimated that 1.2% of older adults in Canada live in long-term care homes.(8) Residents in long-term care homes have a wide range of complex physical and mental health needs. More and more residents have cognitive impairments, such as finding it hard to remember, learn new things, concentrate, or make decisions that affect their everyday life. Many also have several co-existing health conditions.A profile of residents accessing long-term care services in 2019-2020 in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador and the Yukon was recently published.(9) The report revealed that:- long-term care residents have an average age of 83;- approximately 6.7% of residents are under age 65;- 65.2% of residents are female;- the most commonly diagnosed health conditions are:- neurological diseases (for example, dementia and other conditions caused by cerebrovascular accidents),- heart and circulation diseases (for example, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and congestive heart failure), and- musculoskeletal diseases (for example, arthritis and osteoporosis);- 48.5% of residents are suffering with a mild/moderate form of cognitive impairment, and 32.7% of residents are suffering with a severe form;- 43.9% of residents have reduced physical function (meaning the ability to perform activities of daily living such as using the telephone, dressing, to managing medication, or managing finances);- 82.8% are dependent or require extensive assistance when performing daily living activities (for example, personal hygiene, toileting, moving around, and eating); and- 52.8% of residents may have possible depressive symptoms or depressive disorders. The last point highlights the important social, emotional, cultural and spiritual needs of residents in long-term care. The health needs of residents are often intertwined with social needs. Unmet social needs put residents at greater risk for poor health outcomes.(10; 11) These residents may:- lack social support;- be lonely;- be geographically isolated from their families and caregivers;- be financially insecure;- have limited access to services that are gender, linguistically, culturally or spiritually sensitive; or- have marginalized identities that put them at greater risk for discrimination and being excluded.(12) Addressing the wide range of health and social needs of residents is challenging, but must be considered when identifying and harnessing the potential of technology in long-term care homes. There are many long-standing issues in the long-term care sector across CanadaThere are many long-standing issues in the long-term care sector across Canada, including (but not limited to):- a lack of coordination across the long-term care sector;- limited collection and use of data to make improvements;- limited staff training, satisfaction and retention; and- limitations in the design and capacity of long-term care homes. These long-standing issues have been made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic, with dramatic consequences. A federal report indicated that 82% of all COVID-19-related deaths in Canada were associated with long-term care homes.(1) This is at least partially due to:- long-term care home residents being at higher risk for COVID-19 because they live in close proximity to each other;- exposure to staff who may be infected by COVID-19 (which is made worse by long-standing staffing problems); and- most residents being frail and/or living with multiple complex conditions.(13) The full potential of technology isn’t being used to address these issues and to improve the quality of life of residents, caregivers and their familiesTechnology can play an important role in modernizing the long-term care sector in a way that contributes to person-centred care.(14)However, the adoption of technology in long-term care has been slower than in other sectors.(13) This is at least partially due to slow regulatory approvals that are required to use new technologies. Other barriers could include:- the view that older populations lack the ability to learn about (and advocate for) new technology;- costs that prevent long-term care residents from buying smartphones and smart devices; and- lack of assistance and education on using technology and devices.(6) These are just some of the key challenges to harnessing the potential of technology. In the next part of our series, we will examine the barriers to designing and using technologies in long-term care homes.

Although these words do not paint a pleasant picture, if you are living with dementia or are a caregiver for someone who is, they are important to note because they are all symptoms of depression (1-4). Globally, almost half of the approximately 50 million people living with dementia will experience depressive symptoms, with 16 million of those effected not receiving an official depression diagnosis (1;5-7). Regardless of the presence of a formal diagnosis, depressive symptoms result in a variety of consequences, including poor quality of life for patients and greater levels of burden for caregivers (1;8-9). Anti-depressants, antipsychotics, and other medications are likely top of mind when people think of treatments for depression or depressive symptoms. However, both the safety and effectiveness of drug-based treatment options for people with dementia have been questioned (1;10). Take, for example, anti-depressants. Although more research is needed, the currently available evidence does not lend strong support for their use in treating depression in people with dementia, and in particular for a period longer than 3 months (10). What’s more, there are several negative side effects associated with depression medications, including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, blurred vision, falls, broken bones, sleep disturbances, and dry mouth (1;10). Given these findings, there has been increased interest in exploring the effect of non-drug-based options for treating depressive symptoms in people with dementia. Arecentsystematic reviewaimed to provide further insight into the matter, specifically among those experiencing depressive symptoms without an official depression diagnosis (1). The review looked at 40 drug and non-drug treatment options, either alone or in combination with one another, and found promising outcomes with non-drug treatments. More specifically, seven treatment options appeared to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in people with dementia but without a depression diagnosis, in comparison to usual care, which generally involved access to routine health care and in-home supports for carrying out daily activities (e.g., bathing). Six of these successful treatments were solely non-drug strategies, namely: cognitive stimulation on its own; cognitive stimulation combined with exercise and social interaction; massage therapy and touch therapy; occupational therapy; multidisciplinary care; and reminiscence therapy. Only one of the effective strategies included the use of a drug, and this treatment option was a combined effort between cognitive stimulation and dementia treatment drugs known as cholinesterase inhibitors. Outside of this, no other drug treatments on their own appeared to be more effective than usual care at reducing depressive symptoms. We are not done yet! Three strategies—cognitive stimulation combined with a cholinesterase inhibitor; cognitive stimulation combined with exercise and social interaction; and massage and touch therapy—also seemed to be more effective at reducing depressive symptoms when compared to some drugs. At this point, you may be wondering about the specifics of these non-drug strategies. Well, cognitive stimulation involved games, art therapy, or activities that aimed to improve orientation or encourage people to reminisce; exercise referred to aerobics, resistance training, or balance activities; social interactions were those that occurred with other people and went beyond just usual care; massage and touch therapy encompassed massage, acupressure, and therapeutic touch; multidisciplinary care was the execution of a care plan developed through the collaboration of several health professionals; and lastly, reminiscence therapy involved engaging in activities to help one remember their past (1). However, it should be noted that the severity level of the depressive symptoms being experienced could not be studied by the authors of the review. Therefore, the impact of symptom severity on the effectiveness of these strategies cannot be commented on. If you are living with a dementia diagnosis and dealing with depressive symptoms or caring for someone who is, there is help available. The evidence suggests there are a variety of non-drug or combined non-drug and drug treatment options that have the potential to assist with the management of depressive symptoms. Individuals with dementia and/or their caregivers should discuss available treatment options with the health professional or team treating the patient’s dementia to determine the best course of action.']"

Many countries are now looking for strategies to boost their economy and recover from the pandemic. Some countries are considering various policy instruments, including slowly raising the retirement age before people can receive their full pension from their government.(1)The normal age for retirement in Canada is 65, but one cannot be forced to retire at that age. However, you can apply for and receive a full federal retirement pension at age 65 or receive it as early as age 60 with a reduction. With the aging of the population, increasing life expectancy and declining birth rates, one of the most important challenges many countries face is the shrinking labour force, which creates pressure on public-pension systems. This is why several countries are raising the retirement age and access to benefits. By doing so, they hope to keep older workers employed and to stimulate their economy. But beyond potential economic gains, does raising the retirement age have positive effects on the health and wellbeing of older workers? A recent systematic review of 19 studies examined the effects of raising the retirement age on the health, wellbeing and labour force participation of workers aged 45 and over.(2)Although there is still some dissatisfaction associated with raising retirement age, this measure effectively increases the labour-market participation of older workers and helps to push back the age at which workers wish to retire.However, the effects on health and wellbeing are not clear, especially since these concepts are not defined in a consistent way in the studies examined.Health effectsThe majority of studies have reported negative health effects, including:- Health inequalities, especially for disadvantaged and lower paid workers;- A deterioration in the mental health of older male workers before they retire, including the presence of symptoms of depression (delaying eligibility for retirement benefits, combined with limited financial resources, can foster negative thoughts); and- A deterioration in the physical health of workers who participate in active life beyond the age of 64, especially those in physically demanding jobs where working later in life is already really difficult.However, delaying the retirement age and access to retirement benefits does not appear to have an effect on other indicators such as hospitalizations or drug prescribing. Raising the retirement age may even positively influence health promoting behaviors, physical health and health satisfaction among some workers.Effects on wellbeing and job satisfactionIn some studies, job satisfaction has deteriorated as a result of public pension reforms. Having to participate longer in the labour market and contribute longer financially to the public-pension system may be perceived as unfair compared to workers who have been able to retire earlier and yet receive their full benefits.Effects on participation in the labour market and on the perception of the ideal retirement ageAll studies have reported a positive effect on expected retirement age, preferred retirement age and labour-force participation. A study carried out in several European countries also showed that the ideal retirement age increased on average by 1.5 years after the introduction of a public-pension reform.Are there any advantages to working beyond the retirement age?Despite some negative or mixed results, several studies seem to show that there are positive effects to working beyond the age from which you are entitled to retire with your full benefits: maintaining better mental and physical health, as well as better working conditions. Remember that mandatory\xa0retirement\xa0is not allowed in\xa0Canada.\xa0You can't be\xa0forced\xa0out the door just because\xa0you've reached a particular age. Take the time to meet with a financial advisor who will help you establish your budget and target the ideal age at which you can retire without stress. Think of your retirement as a project and think about what you want to achieve during this time.""]"

More than 30 million of those deaths, however, can be attributed to just 10 diseases or conditions. Amongst this list are the usual suspects, heart disease, stroke, Alzheimer’s and other dementias, and specific types of cancer (1). Given the staggering contribution to morbidity and mortality, it comes as no surprise that researchers, health professionals, and the general public are actively studying, prescribing, and seeking different strategies to keep these diseases and conditions at bay. One such strategy, which has emerged over the years, is aspirin. For many of us, the extent of our relationship with this over-the-counter medication doesn’t go beyond taking it to get a fever under control or achieve some relief from aches and pains. With aspirin being widely available and relatively easy to access, should we “buy” into claims around its power to potentially prevent some major threats to our health and well-being? Click on the links below to find out more about the research and the myth-busting results. 1.Aspirin for cardiovascular health? The use of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events—such as heart attacks—in healthy adults is a controversial yet commonly prescribed approach (2;3). Research shows that in adults without a history of heart disease, aspirin use may slightly reduce the risk of heart attack, compared to taking aplaceboor nothing at all. However, it does not appear to reduce the risk of stroke, death from any cause, or death from heart disease-related complications. Evidence also suggests that aspirin use can increase the risk of experiencing major bleeding, including bleeding in the skull and brain (2). These results doNOTapply to people with a history of heart disease or stroke. 2.Aspirin for dementia prevention? The exploration of the relationship between inflammation and dementia has placed a spotlight on anti-inflammatory medications such as aspirin. Research shows that in healthy older adults—described as those with no history of dementia, heart disease, or physical disability—the use of low-dose aspirin (100 mg per day) does not decrease the risk of developing dementia, compared to taking aplacebo. It does, however, increase the risk of major bleeding and death. This lack of benefit weighed against health risks is one reason that we are unlikely to see further studies examining the effects of low-dose aspirin on dementia prevention (4). 3.Aspirin for combating cancer? When it comes to cancer prevention, we see once again that the use of aspirin for this purpose is highly debated. Research shows that in people with no previous history of cancer, long-term aspirin use (e.g., between 1 year to over 10 years) does not reduce total cancer incidence or total cancer deaths, compared to no aspirin use. Furthermore, similar to what has been observed for cardiovascular health and dementia, its long-term use is accompanied by an increased risk of major bleeding and total bleeding events. Despite the safety concerns and lack of benefit demonstrated, more research around aspirin use in high risk populations and for the prevention of specific cancers, and not just cancer overall, is needed (5). So, where does this leave us when it comes to determining whether aspirin is the right choice? Just like with any health-related decision, it’s important to consider the whole picture. Here, this means having a good understanding of our own risk for various cardiovascular issues, dementia, and cancer, as well as weighing the potential benefits against the lack of effect and risk for serious harms through a comprehensive conversation with a health care provider.']"

It is estimated that 6 in 10 Canadians over the age of 66 have experienced an episode of ageism in their lifetime.(1)Such a phenomenon is widespread in many countries and takes various forms, whether it is being sidelined in the workplace, being infantilized in healthcare settings, being invisible when talking about sexuality or opinions. A poll conducted in 57 countries found that 60% of respondents believe that older adults do not receive the respect they deserve.(2)Negative attitudes and stereotypes are acquired at a very young age and each of us can internalize certain prejudices. Many older adults have grown up with preconceived ideas about aging and what older adults can (or supposedly can't) do. This can affect their own well-being in addition to their perception of others. In addition, ageism can also be systemic, for example in the provision of services and programs, which are often designed for a younger population.What can research tell us about the factors that contribute to ageism? A moderate-quality systematic review examined 199 articles on the main determinants of ageism in people aged 50 and over.(2) The review revealed 14 determinants that were strongly associated with ageism. These determinants are observed at three levels: the individual level, the interpersonal / intergroup level, and the institutional / cultural level. Determinants at the individual levelThe most important determinants at this level are anxiety related to aging and fear of death. Studies have shown that certain determinants seem to help alleviate ageism, such as having specific personality traits or psychological factors, such as being conscientious, pleasant and outgoing, or having more of a community spirit than being an individualist. In addition, older adults who are in good mental and physical health seem less likely to be affected by age-related prejudices about their own abilities.Studies show that certain determinants do not have a significant effect on ageism: whether it is age, gender, level of education, cultural or ethnic origin, socioeconomic status, religion, living in an urban or rural area, and civil status.Determinants at the interpersonal / intergroup levelThe older a person gets, the more likely they are to be the target of prejudice. Furthermore, the quality of contacts with older adults in general, but especially with grandparents, would have a beneficial effect in reducing prejudices. People tend to discriminate less against older people if they have a positive image of older adults in their lives.Determinants at the institutional / cultural levelStudies point out that ageism can feed off periods of economic crisis and austerity. If there is a scarcity of economic resources and a significant number of older adults in a society, this can create tensions regarding the distribution of these resources (to finance different public programs and services) and thus foster stereotypes, prejudices or discrimination against older adults. Ageism is a daily challenge for many older adults. Those who see themselves as a burden may also perceive their life to be of less value, which can affect their health and well-being. By fighting ageism, we can empower and motivate older adults to achieve new things, but also to live life to the fullest.Make your voice heard in the public space:You will help increase the representativeness of older people in society and debunk age-related stereotypes, prejudices or discrimination.Participate in intergenerational activities:Connect with young and old in your family and in your community. Several intergenerational programs are often offered in recreation centers, public libraries, retirement homes or schools. These intergenerational initiatives, thanks to the mix of young and old, make it possible to stimulate contacts, make the youngest aware of aging and share positive experiences. Intergenerational housing is another possibility to foster such positive contacts.Create supportive work environments:Creating welcoming workplaces for older workers promotes healthy aging and diversity. Adopt an “Age-Friendly Workplace Charter” to share your vision with employees and customers.""]"

If you’re one of the millions of people coping with a diagnosis of either MCI or dementia or are a caregiver of someone with dementia, you’re likely regularly on the hunt for new approaches to help manage the various aspects of these conditions. Here are a few research-based strategies that can be used to improve cognitive health and mental well-being in people with MCI or dementia. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Get in touch with your artistic side Visual art therapy—a strategy that revolves around using different supplies, approaches, and styles to produce art—can hold cognitive and/or mental health benefits. Take, for example, people with MCI. In this group, engaging in visual art therapy may lead to significant improvements in cognitive function and small reductions in anxiety. Additionally, this activity may moderately reduce depressive symptoms in people with dementia (4). 2.Become familiar with your non-drug options The vast majority of people living with dementia experience agitation—a behavioural issue that is not effectively treated by prescribed medications such as anti-psychotics (5;6). This, coupled with the side effects that can accompany these medications, encourages the use of non-drug treatment options (7;8). In particular, massage therapy, personally tailored interventions, animal-assisted interventions, and pet robot interventions may offer a small to moderate reduction in agitation in adults with dementia (5). 3.Turn on your tech for some computerized brain games Computerized cognitive training refers to computer programs—such as video games, virtual reality activities, and online activities—that aim to improve cognition (e.g., memory, attention, learning, and overall cognition). In people with MCI, computerized cognitive training can lead to moderate short-term improvements in overall cognition, verbal and non-verbal learning, psychosocial functioning, and attention. Large improvements in working memory are another potential benefit. Computerized cognitive training may also provide moderate short-term improvements in visuospatial skills and small improvements in overall cognitive outcomes in people with dementia (9). 4.Exercise both your mind and body Although brain games are a promising approach, combining brain training and physical activity is another strategy that can enhance cognitive function in older adults with or without MCI. Conducting these two activities simultaneously, as opposed to one after the other, may be best (10). In addition to reaping the cognitive rewards, getting in a regular dose of physical exercise is sure to have benefits on other aspects of your physical and mental health. 5.Consider cognitive training as a tool for more than just cognition Beyond its effects on cognitive outcomes, the benefits of cognitive training—computerized cognitive training, cognitive training and rehabilitation, and cognitive stimulation—appear to extend to mental health, as well. Cognitive training can reduce the severity of depressive symptoms in people with MCI or dementia. The size of the effect may differ based on the specific type of training used (11).']"

These technologies bring together a variety of electrical devices intended for our homes, whether electronic locks that can be programmed or video doorbells that can be managed remotely, air-quality sensors, smart light bulbs that can be controlled with your cell phone, motion-sensing cameras, voice-activated televisions and sound systems, and much more.These technologies are said to be ""smart"" in that they use the Internet and advanced levels of automation to operate efficiently, often making automated choices based on past experiences and pre-established settings.Among the array of smart technologies currently available, several have been designed specifically to support aging at home. For example, wireless-sensor networks can be placed in strategic locations to detect falls or emergencies. Different types of sensors can be used to monitor, for example, water consumption, body temperature and vital signs, as well as sleeping, walking or eating patterns. The information collected can be transmitted in real time to caregivers, health professionals or emergency services.Such smart technologies could thus meet a need expressed by a majority of older adults who wish to live independently for as long as possible in their home. It can also be appealing to informal and family caregivers who want to make sure the home is safe, that medications and meals are taken, and that all the necessary care is provided.Adecision support toolexamining different options for maintaining the independence of seniors in daily activities looked at the pros and cons of smart homes. In terms of benefits:• Older adults living in a smart home are more likely to be able to perform daily activities compared to those who do not.• Out of 100 older adults who live in a smart home, seven will avoid hospitalization during the first episode of 30 days of home care.• Current research evidence does not show any effect of smart homes on the number of illnesses or injuries experienced by older adults.These smart homes can also have somedisadvantages, for example:• Some older adults may be afraid of becoming too dependent on these technologies.• Living in a smart home often requires the purchase and installation of equipment. If the technology needs to be connected to the Internet or to a web portal, a monthly fee will also be charged (which can vary from $ 130 and $ 150 per month).• Some older adults living in rural and remote regions that are underserved by technological infrastructure (for example, those without access to high-speed Internet) may have difficulty accessing smart technologies.• Some older adults may not be familiar with computers and this can make it difficult for them to learn to use smart technologies.• The location of the technologies in the home (whether in the bedroom or bathroom) or the types and sizes of the devices can be intrusive.This last point raises an important question dear to older adults, which relates to privacy. Can smart homes protect the privacy of those who wish to age at home? A recent systematic review of 31 articles looked at technologies in smart homes to improve the quality of life of the elderly, mainly those related to health and environmental monitoring, and involving among others the use of sensors and robots.(1) While seniors generally seem to appreciate these technologies because they allow them to stay in their homes, several factors can influence the acceptability of these technologies (for example, age, gender, culture).Technologies from floor to ceilingSmart watches, voice-activated or remote-controlled household devices, infrared motion sensors, water or light intensity sensors, cameras, robots: to continuously monitor the well-being and health of older adults, a variety of devices can be installed everywhere in their house, even on their clothes and on their body.Whether it is an emergency button that can be activated in the event of discomfort or an alert transmitted when a fall is detected, the use of smart technologies promotes autonomy and generates a greater sense of security among older adults, people with disabilities, those with dementia, Alzheimer\'s or Parkinson\'s disease, and their caregivers.In addition, advanced detection techniques and artificial intelligence are used to meet specific user needs. For example, some robots have the ability to recognize distinct activities, perform simple tasks, make it easier for the older adult to complete daily tasks, as well as provide voice reminders for medication.Guaranteeing security and confidentialityThe systematic review underlines that respect for privacy and the security of the data collected and transmitted are issues to be considered. However, it is possible to use less intrusive technologies that recognize postures and not individuals, thereby maintaining confidentiality. In addition, cameras are not always required for a technology to be effective.However, to ensure effective monitoring, it is necessary that the number of sensors is sufficient and that the technologies are deployed in all the rooms of the house, especially those where there is more risk of falling, such as the kitchen, the bedroom and the bathroom. This can sometimes be perceived as an invasion of privacy. If you or a loved one need help with your day-to-day activities at home, a smart home is one solution among many others.-Use a decision support toolto better understand your needs, preferences and the options available to you.- If smart technologies are among the relevant solutions, but you have questions about their impact on your privacy,ask questions to the technology providers and your health professionals.For example :• Are these technologies safe?• Who can change the settings of these technologies?• What types of information are collected?• Is this information ""encrypted"" (that is, coded and protected in such a way that it is incomprehensible to those who do not have the code)?• Is this information shared with third parties (for example, other health professionals or companies offering other services)?']"
46,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2021/06/24/managing-blood-pressure-with-non-medication-based-strategies,24 June 2021,Managing blood pressure with non-medication-based strategies,"['What do medication, dietary approaches, exercise, stress reducing practices, weight loss strategies, alcohol restriction, and comprehensive lifestyle modification have in common? The answer is they are all interventions that aim to lower blood pressure in people living with hypertension (a.k.a. high blood pressure). Non-medication-based strategies can also be used by those with an elevated risk of developing hypertension, known as prehypertension (1;2). Worldwide, hypertension is a significant factor in the development of many diseases—such as those of the heart and brain—and the occurrence of premature death (3). Currently, over 1.1 billion people live with hypertension, with an additional four million projected to be diagnosed with high blood pressure in the next four years (1;3;4). Given both its global prevalence and impact on the lives of individuals, it is important to examine currently available treatment options and preventative strategies with respect to their accessibility, effectiveness, and how they compare to one another. Take, for example, anti-hypertensive medications. This diverse set of medications has proven to be effective in lowering blood pressure in many people and is often the go-to treatment prescribed for hypertension (1;2). However, these medications come with side effects such as low blood pressure, kidney problems, high potassium levels, and fainting; and are costly to patients. Non-medication-based strategies, therefore, could have something to offer. This need for alternative or complementary options is further supported by the fact that not all people respond well to medication and require other approaches to get their blood pressure under control (1;5;6). Onesystematic reviewtook on the task of investigating a variety of non-medication-based strategies in people with established hypertension and prehypertension (1). So, should folks include these strategies in a comprehensive treatment or prevention plan? Low to high-quality evidence shows that non-medication-based strategies may be beneficial for adults with prehypertension to established hypertension. The above-mentioned review specifically found that dietary approaches (i.e., Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension [DASH], low-sodium and high potassium, and salt restriction); physical exercise (i.e., aerobic and isometric); stress reducing practices (i.e., breathing control and yoga); weight loss interventions (i.e., low-calorie diet and low-calorie diet plus exercise); and comprehensive lifestyle modification can reduce both systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to usual care. What’s more, the review identified DASH as the most effective strategy for reducing blood pressure amongst different non-medication-based options tested (1). For those unfamiliar with this dietary pattern, it’s one that places emphasis on the consumption of whole grains, low-fat dairy, fruits, and vegetables, while also recommending a decrease in sodium, saturated fat, and total fat content (1;7;8). It is also important to note that different non-medication-based strategies may have different effects based on the type of blood pressure outcome you are looking at (i.e., systolic or diastolic) and whether you have established hypertension or prehypertension (1). So, take this into consideration when choosing treatment or preventative options. What does this all mean for you? The good news is there are a variety of medication and non-medication-based strategies that can be part of your treatment or prevention approach. Talk to your primary care provider or cardiologist about these diverse options before making any changes, and collaborate on the development of a plan that meets your individual needs and increases your chances of adherence.']"

According to Statistics Canada, 1 in 5 older adults are lonely, feel they lack company, feel abandoned or isolated.(1) Such feelings have been exacerbated since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic given the physical distancing measures, stay at home orders, or curfews. However, the vaccination campaigns are well underway and the number of infections is declining across the country, which seem to offer a glimmer of hope for resuming an active social life soon.Dancing, aerobic, weight training, Nordic walking, aqua-fitness classes… We all know the benefits of physical activity for improving our cardiorespiratory capacities or increasing our muscle mass. But did you know that physical activity could also have beneficial effects on your social health? A systematic review of 38 articles examined the effects of various physical activity interventions on the psychosocial health of 5,288 participants.(2) The studies were from many countries: the United States, United Kingdom, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, China, Canada, Netherlands, New Zealand, Korea, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Turkey, Spain, Brazil, Hungary and Georgia. Participants were recruited in a variety of ways, for example from outpatient clinics, university or community medical centres, through professionals in the health system or municipal services, or through cancer screening programs.Participants were 67% female, aged 51 to 82, were in good health or had common chronic illnesses such as cardiorespiratory diseases, osteoporosis, depression, obesity, insomnia or cancer. People with cognitive impairments (dementia, for example) were not included in these studies.The physical activities were primarily aerobic or muscle building in nature. These activities took place at the gym, at home, in community centres or shelters, online or by phone, in groups or individually. These interventions were also an opportunity to share information with participants, which made it possible to tackle various health-related topics.What can we learn from these studies?Despite the lack of data that would have allowed a comprehensive analysis of the effects of these interventions social support, these interventions showed a positive effect on social health.• Physical activity helps build social relationships between people who share a common interest.• Physical activity improves social skills and self-confidence.• Exercise generates a sense of purpose and reduces loneliness.• At the biological level, physical activity is associated with the production of several hormones linked to well-being and the release of endorphins which are involved in mood control, reduction of the stress hormone, as well as the the activation of your grey matter (a major component of the central nervous system). If your physical condition allows it, join a walking group! This light to moderate-intensity activity offers good opportunities for social interaction and may improve your well-being. Also, aqua-fitness and tai-chi classes are low-impact activities that are good for your health and well-being, while allowing you to interact with others.If your health prevents you from physical activity, join a leisure group to stay active! Whether it is a cooking class, or an arts and crafts class, you will be able to reap the benefits of simply being part of a group and having a feeling of belonging and exchanges on a subject that interests you. By meeting others like you, you will have more opportunities to bond and build a strong social network.But remember that the pandemic is not over yet and it is important to respect the public-health measures in your community.']"

Our peers are an important feature of our daily lives. Over the years, they can be our classmates, colleagues, teammates, walking buddies, those who share the same interests as us, and more. Sometimes, our peers are the individuals we turn to when celebrating the best of times and the ones we lean on during the worst of times. The latter is particularly true. Most if not all of us can recall a point in our lives where we sought support from our peers while undergoing hardship, such as a health issue or struggles with behaviours that can have negative implications for our health. Support from those undergoing a similar experience or time in their lives seems like it would be beneficial, especially because these individuals can understand and empathize with what is happening, provide guidance and advice based on their own lived experience, and encourage us to move forward on our own journey (3;4). But what does the research have to say about leaning on our peers? Here are just a few of the evidence-based benefits of seeking peer support. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Successfully quit smoking Millions of Canadians smoke cigarettes (5). Unfortunately, despite the health risks that accompany this activity—such as cancer, heart disease, and early death—quitting is no easy feat (6). One strategy people who smoke can use, either alone or in combination with other treatment options like medication or nicotine replacement therapy, is group therapy or support programs (7;8). Research indicates that engaging in these group-based programs makes you 50% to 130% more likely to successfully quit smoking in comparison to self-help (e.g., getting literature on smoking cessation) (7). 2.Abstain from alcohol use Almost six million Canadians engage in heavy drinking, which makes them more susceptible to developing alcohol use disorder—a condition with negative effects on one’s cognitive, emotional, and physical health (9-11). Research shows that compared to other well-established treatments, standardized peer-led Alcoholics Anonymous/professionally-led Twelve-Step Facilitation programs are better at increasing abstinence in adults battling alcohol use disorder, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependence. In fact, those who engage in these generally free and easily accessible programs are 3% to up to 42% more likely to abstain from alcohol use (12). 3.Lower your blood sugar Over 2.4 million Canadians have diabetes, with type 2 diabetes being the most common form of the disease (13;14). Research illustrates that peer support may help lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes, compared to standard diabetes care. Features of effective peer support include having more frequent support sessions (e.g., a minimum of one to two a month) and receiving one-on-one support vs. group support or a combination of both (4). This strategy may be most effective in people with poor blood sugar control (4;15). 4.Keep physically active Despite the clear health benefits, one in four adults don’t get an enough exercise (16). For older adults, financial, physical, and social barriers, in addition to feeling that their needs are not met by recreational facilities, and the disconnect with those who lead exercise programs due to age gaps may contribute to this lack of physical activity (17-20). Research demonstrates that peer-led exercise programs and peer-support programs may improve adherence to physical activity in older adults (17). Adapting peer support in times of pandemic In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic and measures put in place to control it, utilizing in-person peer support programs or services may not be possible or recommended at this time. On the bright side, these types of programs and services can be delivered and accessed virtually through telephones, smartphones, computers, tablets, videoconferencing tools, and mobile applications.""]"

It\xa0is important to be able to access information in the media, but above all to be able to analyze it and separate the wheat from the chaff. Digital media are an infinite source of information, especially about health-related issues, and can influence our decision-making processes. Failure to take a critical look at media content can lead to bad decisions, marginalization, social isolation, feelings of exclusion and technological anxiety.In addition, the development of new information and communication technologies leads us to play new roles. We are no longer just ""passive receivers"" of information. We are becoming creators of media content, whether it is by sharing news, photos, videos and much more.Given the evolution of digital media, how can we promote media literacy among older adults? A recent moderate-quality systematic review examined 40 studies of media literacy interventions in older adults, predominantly women over 60 years of age.(1)The research looked at the use of digital media (knowing how to use devices, software, search engines, social media, online services, or email) and the ability to understand and appraise information, including recognizing reliable sources. The creation of content (whether written documents, photos and videos, or even an online health profile) has been examined to a lesser extent. However, it should not be neglected, because it allows you to familiarize yourself with technologies while promoting well-being, autonomy, expression and active participation.The various media education interventions resulted in positive attitude changes, such as increased confidence, self-esteem, family interactions and quality of life, as well as decreased loneliness and social isolation.They have also fostered an increase in information and communication technology skills, as well as improved knowledge about health-related issues.But these interventions could use different pedagogical approaches (or ways to teach). The review identified four pedagogical approaches commonly used:1. Formal, teacher-centred pedagogy:content designed by the teacher, in small groups or individually, with an adapted pace, printed manuals, peer learning, and collaborative tasks.2. Individual and learner-centred pedagogy:individual and sometimes intergenerational tutoring, the content of which is defined according to the needs of the participant.3. Blended and online pedagogy:one-on-one tutoring, age-appropriate learning systems that can be used with minimal or no computer skills, often aimed at acquiring basic computer skills.4. Creative and learner-centred pedagogy:an individual approach whose main objective is not necessarily to learn to use technologies, but rather to give free rein to personal expression to promote active participation.Regardless of the approach used, what has made the educational interventions successful is the role and benevolence of tutors, peers, teachers, and professionals, as well as support provided individually or in a group. No matter your age, health, previous experiences with digital media, training exists to help you improve your confidence and skills, especially in the use of online health services, and understanding the information found on the Internet.• Identify your digital media needs(use, understanding and / or creating media content).• Think about what pedagogical approach would work best for you.• Benefit from intergenerational support.Young people around you would surely be happy to share their knowledge of the use of new information and communication technologies.• Find out what programs and services are available at your public library or community centre.Media literacy workshops are often offered to older adults. You may also be interested in content creation activities, whether it is writing your memoirs, or producing video content.']"

Can we use aspirin to combat cancer?,"['Whether from personal experience or through witnessing the journey of a loved one, we’ve all been touched by cancer in some way, shape, or form. Last year alone, around 10 million people died from cancer, the leading cause of death worldwide (1). As cancer cases and deaths continue to rise, researchers are focused on identifying strategies that can help to prevent and treat the variety of diseases that fall under this broad term. When it comes to prevention, you may be surprised to learn that one highly debated strategy comes in the form of an over-the-counter medication that many of us have readily on hand. We use it to help get rid of headaches, relieve sore muscles, and reduce fevers. Although this generic description fits many different painkillers, aspirin is the focus of this particular conversation; just like it has been in previous discussions around heart health and dementia prevention (2-4). With aspirin popping up again as a potential preventative strategy, what will the research show this time? Can we rely on it to help us thwart cancer? A relativelyrecentsystematic reviewlooked at long-term aspirin use and its ability to help prevent cancer in people who have not previously had cancer (2). Similar to previous findings for stroke and death in people with no heart disease and dementia in healthy older adults, aspirin use doesn’t appear to be protective against developing cancer and continues to be associated with adverse side effects (2-4). Overall, the review found that in people with no previous history of cancer, long-term use of aspirin (i.e., between 1 - 5 years, 5 -10 years, and over 10 years) does not reduce total cancer incidence or total cancer deaths, compared to no aspirin use. However, the use of aspirin does increase the risk of experiencing a major bleed by anywhere between 32% - 57%; and may increase total bleeding events by anywhere between 33% - 74%. The lack of benefits and presence of side effects are seen across different doses of aspirin, aspirin use duration, and populations (such as healthy people, people living with diabetes, and people with heart disease or an increased risk of heart disease) (2). With that said, the authors of the review do note the need for more research in two areas, the first being aspirin use in higher risk populations, such as those with a family history of cancer (2). The second area is aspirin’s effects on individual types of cancer, as opposed to an overall analysis like that done in this review. This is because there is some evidence to show a potential preventive effect for specific cancers (e.g., colorectal cancer) (2; 22). Be sure to discuss your cancer risk and preventative strategies that may work best for you with your health care provider. Although, overall, aspirin may not be an effective cancer prevention strategy, there are evidence-based lifestyle changes that we can incorporate into our daily lives to help reduce cancer risk. These include:']"
51,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2021/05/19/supporting-greater-mobility-through-autonomous-vehicles,19 May 2021,Supporting greater mobility through autonomous vehicles,"['Mobility is an important issue for everyone. People want to be able to move around independently, which allows them to go about their daily activities (for example, going to work, shopping, going to medical appointments), to lead an active social life, or even to nurture a sense of freedom.Yet, age-related changes can affect our physical and mental health. They can also affect our ability to walk, cycle, or drive a vehicle.For many years, autonomous vehicles have been a futuristic dream. However, technological advancements indicate that it will be the reality of tomorrow. These road vehicles (for example, cars or buses) are equipped with an autonomous driving system that has the ability to drive without the intervention of a driver.Could these autonomous vehicles improve mobility for older adults? A recent systematic review provided an update on the state of knowledge of the factors that limit the mobility and well-being of older adults, as well as the potential of autonomous vehicles.(1)This review highlights that older adults are a heterogeneous group. Their travel needs are very different and can also vary depending on life events (for example, retirement, deteriorating health, relocation, or the loss of a loved one).The review reveals that the mobility of older adults is influenced by four main factors:- Health factors: The inability or decline of physical, sensory, motor or cognitive skills necessary to walk, cycle, drive or use public transport services can limit mobility. For example, severe arthritis can hinder the use of technological interfaces. As they age, older adults may also fear being involved in an accident, whether as an occupant of a vehicle or as a pedestrian, and refuse to use taxis, public transport or even carpooling.- Environmental factors:The built environment, including the roads and the vehicles that circulate on them, must be considered according to the needs of people with reduced mobility, for example low sidewalks or safe crosswalks at intersections.- Economic factors:Declining income is an obstacle to mobility for the elderly, as fares for the use of transport can be high, despite the fact that a large part of the aging baby boom generation in many countries is richer and healthier than previous cohorts.- Social factors:They refer to social ties, routines, or informal interactions. Some studies suggest that people who cannot drive tend to have less social contacts, and that many older adults prefer not to participate in community activities if they must depend on others for transportation. There is limited\xa0research evidence that examined the potential of autonomous vehicles, while considering the factors influencing the mobility of seniors. In addition, due to the heterogeneity of the elderly population, it is difficult to determine whether autonomous vehicles will meet the needs of older adults. Some older adults seem less receptive to technology and might not want to use autonomous vehicles (whether it has to be an autonomous car or bus). Some people use public transport to chat with the driver: the autonomous buses may not meet their need for social interaction due to the absence of a driver.Autonomous vehicles can be integrated with existing public transport services, leveraging vehicle automation for a sustainable perspective. However, the types of autonomous vehicles will depend on consumer preferences: driverless buses, autonomous taxis for solo or shared passengers, with or without twinning of passengers according to their age, health and interests, fares advantageous.The supply of autonomous vehicles must be in line with the built environment and road infrastructure. In addition, they must not compromise walking and cycling, which contribute to active aging and which offer opportunities for social participation.']"

However, unlike in the movies, slipping on a banana peel or tripping on an untied shoelace is no laughing matter. Falls are a real problem that can lead to serious consequences such as injury and death. Annually, over 37 million falls worldwide end up needing medical intervention, while nearly 700,000 people die as a result of a fall. Age increases our risk of experiencing a fall, as well as injuring ourselves from a fall (1)—think osteoporosis, declining vision, reduced walking speed, etc. In fact, when it comes to falls that lead to death, the majority occur in older adults (1). Maintaining foot health through podiatry care, regularly reviewing medications, balance-recovery training, and exercise alone or coupled with other strategies—such as environmental assessment and modification—have shown the potential to help reduce the risk of falls (2-6). Exercise, in particular, seems to be a hot topic when it comes to falls prevention. Arecentsystematic reviewplaced a type of exercise known as dance-based mind-motor activity and its impact on falls risk at centre-stage. Here, dance-based mind-motor activities involved the following components: mind-motor movements done in the upright position; choreography or instructions; structuring of the exercise using external or internal rhythms, such as music or breathing; a focus on dynamic balance (i.e., staying balanced while moving around or changing positions); and interaction with others (7). Tai Chi and non-Tai Chi activities like ballroom dancing and folk dancing are examples of this form of exercise, which engages both our sensory and cognitive functions (7-9). To those of us who find it difficult to engage in more traditional forms of exercise or would like to diversify our exercise routine, dance-based mind-motor activities surely sound like an exciting addition to our fall prevention plan. But before we make our way to the ""dance floor,"" let’s see what the evidence has to say. The review found dance-based mind-motor activities may hold benefits for fall prevention and physical function in healthy older adults, compared to other types of exercise, no exercise, or usual care. First, dance-based mind-motor activities may reduce the risk of falling (a.k.a. the number of people who have a fall) by 37% and the rate of falls (a.k.a. the number of falls) by 31%. In terms of specific dance-based mind-motor activities, Tai Chi was found to be effective in improving these falls outcomes, while a small number of studies found that non-Tai Chi activities were not effective. Second, dance-based mind-motor activities may moderately improve measures of physical function such as balance, mobility, and lower body strength, but not upper body strength. For balance and mobility outcomes, both Tai Chi and non-Tai Chi activities were effective, but the latter was especially beneficial. For lower body strength, only non-Tai Chi activities were effective. Third, engaging in these activities 3 or more times a week for a period of 12 to 24 weeks may result in greater benefits. With that said, future research that focuses on non-Tai Chi activities and provides further evidence on the most ideal frequency and duration of dance-based mind-motor exercises is needed (7). In the meantime, speak with your health care provider about the benefits of adding these exercises to your routine. They may be able to help you choose the best activity for you, taking into consideration your individual health needs, physical capabilities, and safety. In the absence of in-person dance classes, Tai Chi programs, and other similar services, try accessing online classes or programming.']"

If you do, know that you are not alone. These stressful experiences that leave you feeling embarrassed are par for the course in folks with urinary incontinence and affect hundreds of millions of people worldwide (1-3). What’s more, this condition is extremely common in older adults and is two times more prevalent in older women than older men (1). Urinary incontinence takes a significant toll on your physical, mental, and social health. In everyday life, these negative impacts can manifest as increases in urinary tract infections and pressure ulcers, decreases in physical activity, poor perceptions of yourself, and lower levels of social interaction that lead to social isolation (2;4-6). Fortunately, a variety of treatments exist to help folks with this condition cope or achieve success in beating it. For those not wanting to add another medication to the medicine cabinet or looking to supplement an existing management plan, a non-drug option such as pelvic floor muscle training might be of interest (2). This form of training relies on exercises that work to enhance aspects of your pelvic floor muscles, such as muscle endurance, power, and strength (2;7). An example of these exercises includes squeezing and relaxing the pelvic floor muscles (2). But do these exercises work?Asystematic review, looking specifically at the impact of this strategy on women, has this query covered (2). Although more long-term research is needed on pelvic floor muscle training, the currently available evidence is positive. The authors of the review concluded that this form of training could be suggested as a primary treatment option for women with urinary incontinence. Let’s delve into the details! First, we have women with stress urinary incontinence—involves unintentionally leaking urine during times where you are exerting yourself. The review found that when these women engaged in pelvic floor muscle training, they were eight times more likely to state that they had been cured than women not receiving any treatment or receiving another treatment that did not involve activity (e.g., motivational telephone calls,placebomedications, etc.). Second, when combining outcomes like patient-reported cure and improvement of urinary incontinence, women doing pelvic floor exercises were six times more likely to state that they had experienced one of these two benefits. Third, the evidence also showed a potential for symptom improvement due to pelvic floor muscle training. When it comes to women with any type of urinary incontinence (i.e., stress incontinence, urgency incontinence [unintentionally leaking urine during or immediately following a sudden urge to urinate], or both) engaging in pelvic floor muscle training, similar results were brought to light. More specifically, these women were five times more likely to report that they had been cured than women not receiving treatment or receiving a non-pelvic floor training treatment. The women doing muscle training were also two times more likely to report that they had experienced either a cure or improvement in urinary incontinence when these two outcomes were looked at together. What’s more, women with urinary incontinence—regardless of type—may see a reduction in the number of leakage episodes experienced over one day and a decrease in the amount of urine lost with pelvic floor muscle training. And last but not least, safety. Based on studies that did report on negative side effects from engaging in pelvic floor muscle training, such events were uncommon, and when they did occur, they were not serious (e.g., pain, discomfort while exercising, temporary worsening of symptoms, etc.) (2). All in all, pelvic floor muscle training appears to be a generally safe and solid addition to your bladder control management plan. Even better, it can be done at home with little to no equipment and with guidance from online videos, mobile apps, or instructions provided by a health professional (e.g., physiotherapist, general practitioner, or specialist nurse). If you do decide to use an online resource, remember to make sure that it's evidence-based and comes from a trustworthy source. Consult with a health professional (e.g., physiotherapist, general practitioner, or specialist nurse) before commencing as they may direct you to a specific in-person or online program, exercises to do on your own, or offer such services themselves.""]"

Among these, we count the homeless and people who are precariously housed. These people are at increased risk of COVID-19 infection due to risk factors related to underlying medical conditions, but also their difficulty in adhering to public-health guidelines such as physical distancing and confinement due to their housing conditions.(1)Homelessness and housing insecurity are affecting many people. This is the experience of more than 35,000 people every day in Canada. Each year, it is estimated that more than 235,000 people will experience homelessness in the country. The number of homeless people aged 50 and over continues to increase. They represent 24.4% of homeless shelter users.(2)Supporting people who are homeless or who are precariously housed remains a complex issue, even more so in the context of a pandemic. Various support strategies could be put in place, including the use of case managers.According to theCanadian Observatory on Homelessness, case management is a collaborative, planned approach to ensure that a person experiencing homelessness gets the services and supports they need to move forward in life. Case management strategies often come from the mental health and addiction sector. A case manager assesses the needs of their client (and possibly their family) and, when necessary, organizes, coordinates and advocates for the delivery of a range of programs and services designed to meet the needs of their client, and ensures access to them.Do these case management interventions have beneficial effects for people who are homeless or precariously housed? A systematic review of 56 studies examined the effectiveness of four types of interventions with homeless or precariously housed people in relation to housing stability, mental health, quality of life, drug addiction, hospitalization , employment and income.(3)Across the continuum of services, four key models of case management exist: standard case management, intensive case management, critical time intervention, and assertive community treatment. Although these interventions are varied in terms of definition, complexity, target populations, and modes of delivery, the results show that case management must be continuous, community-based and intensive in order to maintain or increase gains obtained.Let's take a closer look at the four types of case management:1. Standard case managementaims to provide a set of health and social services to help the person maintain good health and social relationships. This approach involves client engagement, assessment, planning, linkage with resources, consultation with their families, collaboration with the various professionals involved and crisis intervention. Studies that have examined such an approach reveal that standard case management can have limited and short-term effects on substance abuse and housing. However, some clients may experience increased hostility and depression.2. Intensive case managementtargets people with more complex, serious and persistent health, mental health and addiction problems to help them maintain their housing, access services and achieve a better quality of life, with long-term support of a 24/7 case manager. Studies show that such an approach appears to have positive effects, including a reduction in the number of days spent homeless, reduced substance abuse, and improved income.3. Critical time interventionallows for continuity of care during times of transition, such as after discharge from hospital. Such services, limited in time, aim to strengthen the support network of the person within the community and to promote his autonomy. Studies have found that such an approach promotes a slight reduction in psychological symptoms and a reduction in the number of emergency room visits and hospital stays, but also appears to have promising effects on housing stability.4. Assertive community treatmentaims to provide care and services tailored to the needs and goals of each person, intensively through a multidisciplinary team of health workers available 24/7 within the community. Studies show that such an approach helps reduce the number of emergency room visits and hospital days, and appears to be efficient for people with complex needs, from an overall cost and benefit perspective to clients. , the health care system and society as a whole. Case management experiences show that the success of such programs depends, among other things, on a relationship of trust with their case manager, but also on interventions chosen according to the specific context and needs of the client.(3)You too can help!Get involved and share your ideas:It is possible to get involved in order to advocate for the rights of homeless or precariously housed people, but also to share your ideas in order to find solutions. For example, theCanadian Alliance to End Homelessnessis a national coalition of individuals, organizations and communities working together to end homelessness in Canada.Support your local shelters:Call the homeless shelters in your community to find out their exact needs (whether certain types of clothing, food, or other resources).Volunteer your time:Homeless shelters across the country depend on volunteers to keep their doors open and keep operations running smoothly.It is possible to help people get out of homelessness and end housing insecurity if we all put our shoulders to the wheel.""]"

Mood disorders—like depression—are especially prevalent, with over 2.8 million Canadians experiencing a mood disorder in 2019 (2). Amongst older adults, depression is the most common mental illness (3;4). As the world continues to battle COVID-19, we can’t speak about mental health and well-being without acknowledging the impacts that this virus, and the efforts made to manage it, have had on us. Fear and anxiety around getting sick or having loved ones contract the virus; grief over the loss of family, friends, or community members; frustration from disruptions to everyday life; and social isolation brought on by limited to no in-person interaction with loved ones outside of our immediate household are just a few of the ways our thoughts, feelings, and actions have been affected. In fact, last year, over one-third of Canadians aged 65 and older expressed that there had been a negative impact on their mental health since the initiation of vital physical distancing measures (5). Why might that be? Well, the social isolation that stems from having to be physically distant from family, friends, neighbours, and other important figures in our lives can increase the risk of depression. Additionally, access to mental health services that can help us cope with and treat the issue have also decreased (3;4;6;7). However, technology may offer some help when it comes to keeping us connected with much needed health services.Arapid reviewhas placed the spotlight on technology by investigating the effect of telemedicine as a treatment for older adults with depressive symptoms or disorders who live in the community (3). In the case of this review, telemedicine interventions generally referred to telephone-based strategies employed by counselors, social workers, nurses, or psychologists and internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) that was sometimes self-guided and other times self-guided with additional feedback from a clinician. Although more comprehensive research is needed to further solidify the results, the review found that internet-based CBT may reduce depressive symptoms in community-dwelling older adults who experience depressive symptoms or depressive disorders, compared to usual care. CBT stands out as a good candidate for improving mental well-being within a virtual setting due to its adaptability. Another check mark for CBT is that various health care providers are trained to administer it. In terms of telephone-based strategies, only two of six studies that looked at this strategy showed a positive result (3). However, in times of limited access to services, telephone support may still be a worthwhile option. Taken all together, the use of telemedicine as a way to provide and access mental health resources during the COVID-19 pandemic seems like a valuable strategy to try. Generally, such services could come at a cost depending on factors such as the individual’s personal or provincial insurance plan, etc. However, there’s good news! Canada’s federal, provincial, and territorial governments have already moved forward with this strategy, providing a variety of freely available online, telephone, and mobile application-based resources during this time. This removes barriers to access like cost, transportation, and mobility issues.']"

Are you comfortable in this role or do you feel anxious and uncomfortable? Do you know their wishes for the end of life?Family members are often expected to take care of their loved ones at the end of their life and accompany them until their last rest. But today, families are smaller and geographically dispersed: many people find themselves alone (or with limited support) at the last stage of their life.We have been witnessing the emergence of a new profession related to end-of-life care: the end-of-life doulas (sometimes referred as ""death doulas""). The term “doulas” typically refer to birth attendants who continuously support pregnant women before, during and after childbirth. End-of-life doulas\xa0also offers continuous support, but to people at the end of life and their families.What is the role of a end-of-life doulas\xa0and how does it fit into the continuum of end-of-life care? A recent moderate-quality systematic review identified five studies examining the role of end-of-life doulas.(1) This review reveals that their role is not always well understood or recognized and that the tasks associated with it varies widely. Various non-medical tasksAs they are not yet considered to be regulated health professionals, they offer non-medical support complementary to palliative and end-of-life care. As needed, they can provide a compassionate presence (for example, read stories, put on music, listen to the dying person and their loved ones, hold their hands, soothe them), help with decision-making by giving information, help navigate health and social services to meet needs, or help loved ones to come to terms with imminent death. (1)Roles varying according to the care settingsIn hospital settings or care establishments where end-of-life doulas\xa0offer psychological, social and spiritual support, they often have a volunteer status. Outside of hospital settings, when they are hired directly by families, for example, their services are usually remunerated.(1)In search of recognitionThe role of end-of-life doulas\xa0is still poorly understood. While some describe them as ""older daughters"" caring for their dying parents, others see their role more as having similarities to nurses specializing in palliative care.(1)Although courses to become a end-of-life doula are offered in many countries and Canadian provinces, there is currently no official certification to practise this profession. However, the End-of-Life Doula Association of Canada continues to work to ensure that end-of-life doulas\xa0are considered part of the palliative care team.(2) Although death is a part of life, it is a complex experience that everyone approaches differently. Palliative care provides a certain level of medicalized physical comfort, as well as emotional and social support to patients, their families and their caregivers.The authors of the review conclude that end-of-life doulas\xa0may represent a new direction for personalized care directly controlled by the dying person and a complement to existing services.(1)It\'s never too early to make your end-of-life wishes known, and to plan for the end-of-life care you want.

These outbreaks and pandemics may vary in length and scale but are similar in that they can cause significant death and illness. Take, for example, COVID-19, which to date is responsible for more than 118 million cases and over 2.6 million deaths globally (1). Canada accounts for nearly 900 thousand cases and over 22 thousand deaths (2). These numbers demonstrate just how infectious some respiratory viruses can be. The spread of respiratory viruses generally occurs through droplets expelled from an infected individual—for instance, via the nose or mouth when talking, sneezing, or coughing. Therefore, close contact with an infected person or an object containing germs from these droplets can increase the risk of infection (3-5). Efforts to decrease the transmission of respiratory viruses often rely on multiple strategies done in combination with one another. These include: handwashing with soap and water; the use of alcohol based hand sanitizers/rubs; etiquette around coughing and sneezing (e.g., coughing or sneezing into a tissue or the bend of your arm), avoiding touching one’s face, eyes, nose, and mouth; physical distancing; isolation of sick individuals; quarantines; vaccines; and face masks (5;6). Despite being a widely used practice in certain parts of the world, even in everyday non-pandemic situations, the wearing of face masks has become a controversial issue during the present pandemic.  Behind the controversy is the question of whether masks are effective in preventing the transmission of respiratory viruses from one person to another. Acomprehensivesystematic reviewlooking at the usage of different types of masks (including medical, surgical, and cotton), multiple types of respiratory viruses (influenza, SARS, and COVID-19), and two populations (health care workers and non-healthcare workers) investigated the issue further (3). Mask up! The results are positive and lend support to recommendations around mask wearing. More specifically, the review found that wearing a mask can decrease the transmission of respiratory viruses in both health care workers and non-health care workers. To better understand the results, let’s break them down with numbers. In health care workers, the results translate into an average of 44 less people out of 100 getting infected, compared to no mask use. Even better, in non-health care workers, the results translate into an average of 78 less people becoming infected (3). Now, do these results mean we can just rely on mask wearing alone? The answer isNO. Mask wearing must be practiced in addition to other public health strategies such as hand hygiene, coughing and sneezing etiquette, physical distancing, vaccines, and so on. Unfortunately, no comment can be made on which type of mask is most effective amongst those included in the review. However, you can stay up to date on current recommendations by regularly referring to government and public health organizations websites’ or other trusted groups—such as the World Health Organization—for information. For comprehensive guidance on when the general public needs to wear a mask; materials, construction, and fit; proper use; safety considerations; and answers to other mask-related questions, please visit theGovernment of Canada's website(7).

Although there are still challenges in terms of vaccine supply, decision-makers are also facing the challenge of communicating to the public about their vaccination plans, and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. This is particularly challenging in a context where new information (and misinformation) about COVID-19 vaccines is emerging on a daily basis. This can exacerbate vaccine hesitancy or confidence among the public, which may interfere with the achievement of vaccination targets. Indeed, it is estimated that 60-80% of the world’s population must be vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity” for COVID-19.(1, 2) According to the Mayo Clinic, herd immunity (sometimes referred as community immunity) occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, which makes the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely.To help Canadian decision-makers as they respond to unprecedented challenges related to the pandemic, theCOVID-19 Evidence Network to support Decision-making (COVID-END)has reviewed what is known about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.(3) This blog post is the third in a series which examine evidence and experiences from Canada and other countries about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. It focuses on the set of challenges facing decision-makers when communicating vaccine-allocation plans and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Decision-makers are facing many challenges related to communicating to the public about their vaccination plans, and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.(3) They must plan carefully for the following: Who should be the target of the communication plans?-\xa0the general public- high-risk groups (for example, health workers, older and frail adults, those with chronic conditions, essential workers)- individuals who are hesitant about (or opposed to)\xa0vaccination How should they communicate with them?-who should communicate the information (for example, healthcare workers, research experts, teachers, business leaders, government leaders, community leaders, or the media)- how often should we communicate with them (for example, every day or week)- for how long- what method should they use to communicate (for example, social media platforms, text messages, emails, telephone calls, radio, television, face-to-face by video, face-to-face in person) What information should be communicated to them?-\xa0data and evidence about safety and effectiveness in terms of both protection against COVID-19 (including duration of protection) and protection against transmission (and other factors that may contribute to vaccine acceptance and hesitancy)- information about new types of vaccines, current vaccine options (for example, the number of vaccines available in the country, number of doses required of any given vaccine) and prioritized populations- information (for health workers) about vaccine-administration protocols- information to address myths and misinformation about vaccines- information about the anticipated timing of when all those who want a vaccine will have been\xa0vaccinated Research evidence shows thatvaccine hesitancy is universal across countries. A medium-quality rapid review revealed that such hesitancy typically manifested in the preference to wait to be vaccinated or to reject vaccination altogether. The most cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy or refusal included fear of side effects, safety, and effectiveness, as well as the expedited development of the COVID-19 vaccines, perceived political interference, and misinformation.But many organizations have produced evidence-informed guidelines to help decision-makers in their communication efforts. For instance, the World Health Organization (WHO) produced a guideline providinginsights about factors that may help vaccine acceptance and uptake. This guideline is based on behavioural research (the types of research examining when and why individuals behave as they\xa0do) that has shown that vaccine acceptance and uptake can be increased by using three types of strategies: -creating an enabling environment– making vaccination easy, quick and affordable -harnessing social influences– especially from people who are particularly trusted by and identified with members of relevant communities -increasing motivation– through open and transparent communication about uncertainty and risks, as well as the safety and benefits of vaccination The WHO guideline also emphasized that communication interventions should be tailored to mitigate inequalities, particularly to Black, Asian and minority ethnic groups who have higher rates of infection, morbidity and mortality, as well as unvaccinated or under-vaccinated populations. A medium-quality rapid review also indicated thatcommunication of\xa0reliable, frequent, and tailored information about vaccinesshould be shared with community members through multiple platforms (for example, social media, traditional media, and providers). The review also highlighted that providers must be educated about vaccines and provided with appropriate training to increase provider vaccine recommendations to patients. As the pandemic evolves, communication plans may be adapted to respond to new events (for example, new variants, new data and evidence about the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants, or possible cases of adverse events following vaccination). In the fourth part of our series, we will examine the challenges of administering COVID-19 vaccines in ways that optimize timely uptake.']"

One condition that also belongs under the umbrella of CVD but that may not always be front and centre is peripheral artery disease or PAD (1). PAD is a condition caused by the accumulation of plaque in the arteries. This build-up triggers the narrowing of these arteries, thereby decreasing the flow of blood to affected areas of the body (2). The legs are a common site where PAD occurs (2;3). People with PAD experience the disease differently when it comes to symptoms and complications. Some may have no symptoms, whereas others may deal with mild or severe symptoms—such as pain in the legs when physically active (2-5). Symptoms like leg pain can lead folks with PAD to become less active, further diminishing their heart health (3;6-8). The ability to perform activities of daily living may also be affected, and in severe cases, amputation may become necessary. Together these issues set the foundation for a reduced quality of life among people with PAD (4). Currently, a recommended treatment option is engaging in exercise, namely facility-based supervised exercise programs (3;9). However, even outside of a pandemic, there are many barriers to accessing such programs including the lack of widespread availability of programming (3;10), remote or rural living, mobility issues, and challenges around transportation. Can such barriers be overcome? Let’s turn to arecentsystematic reviewinvestigating whether structured home exercise is an effective option for people living with PAD in their legs (3). Within the review, home exercise programs generally included: walking as a form of physical activity; contact with a professional—psychologist, counsellor, or exercise specialist—for motivation; and recommendations to exercise three to five times a week. The treadmill test (i.e., walking performed on a treadmill) and the 6-minute walking test (i.e., the distance a participant is able to walk over six-minutes) were used to measure walking performance, while accelerometers or pedometers were used to measure activity levels. The results show small but statistically significant improvements in the maximum distance walked and the distance walked before experiencing leg pain in people with PAD in their legs who engage in structured home exercise programs, compared to those not exercising. Physical activity levels also went up. All of these enhancements were seen over the short-term (6 months or less). For those with leg PAD who can’t access a supervised exercise program or prefer non-facility based exercise, speak with your health care provider (e.g., physician, vascular specialist, cardiologist, etc.) about whether a structured home exercise program is the next best option for you. Work with your provider to develop a program that takes into consideration your limitations, individual needs, and safety.']"

In this blog post, we explore how some older adults have defined successful aging. A recent systematic review of 22 studies examined how older adults define ""successful aging"".(2) Although older adults are not a homogeneous group (since gender, culture or state of health can influence perceptions), 12 themes emerged from the literature: 1.

Maintaining and cultivate a positive attitudeto maintain emotional well-being.3. Being healthyto stay independent for as long as possible.4.

When it comes to technology, many of us frequently hear that we are too “plugged in”. Although exercising moderation around the use of our favorite devices is important, research has shown that we can also lean on technology to support our healthy aging goals. Assistance with medication management, providing avenues to socialize and connect with others, facilitating access to health information, and helping folks keep focused and motivated as they work toward personal goals such as smoking cessation or weight loss are just a few examples of how being “plugged in” can be valuable (1-4). But does this value extend to those who are diagnosed with or are at risk of diabetes, one of the leading causes of death globally (5)? We can turn to arecentsystematic reviewabout the effect of mobile phone apps on various diabetes subtypes for guidance (6). The three types of diabetes highlighted in this review include: prediabetes (a condition where blood sugar levels are elevated, thereby increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes), type 1 diabetes (a disease in which a person’s immune system attacks cells that produce insulin), and type 2 diabetes (a disease associated with poor nutrition, excess weight, and low activity levels) (6-9). Given that adopting a healthy lifestyle is a key treatment strategy across diabetes subtypes and a preventive strategy for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes, it is no surprise that the mobile phone apps studied focused on lifestyle modification. App features varied, but examples include the monitoring of diet and exercise behaviours, support for adjusting medications, feedback from health care provides, and cognitive strategies to boost motivation (6). The most promising results are for type 2 diabetes. More specifically, the review found that mobile apps for lifestyle modification can lower average blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes. These reductions occurred both in the short-term (3-6 months) and the long-term (9-12 months). Unfortunately, the results for pre-diabetes and type 1 diabetes were not as positive or as convincing. In people with prediabetes or type 1 diabetes, using these mobile apps does not appear to have an effect on average blood sugar levels in the short-term. No comment can be made on the long-term effect for prediabetes because there was no data for this outcome. On the other hand, a decrease in average blood sugar levels may occur in the long-term for people with type 1 diabetes, but this finding was based on just one study and therefore more research is needed before definitive conclusions can be made. These results point to the need for more research in two areas. The first being the intersection between mobile app usage and prediabetes and type 1 diabetes. The second being the effectiveness and safety of these apps past a one year period (6). For folks with type 2 diabetes, the addition of a mobile phone app that supports lifestyle adjustments to your treatment arsenal may be worth a try. Before you dive into this virtual app ocean, there are several considerations to keep in mind: some apps are free while others come at a cost; make sure to compare and contrast multiple apps before settling on one; look at the features offered; read the reviews left by past and present users; and pay attention to any comments about adverse effects or challenges, as app safety is not always adequately evaluated. Don’t forget to connect with your health care provider to discuss your interest in this strategy, perhaps how best to integrate it into your treatment plan, and any concerns over safety that you may have.']"

They promote the practice of physical and social activities, improve mental well-being, and reduce heat islands.(1-2) Whether through community gardening or walking in neighbourhoods or parks, people of all ages report experiencing relaxing or invigorating effects after going out into nature.But when it comes to urban green spaces, the presence of trees seems to play a particularly important role. Let's take a look at what research is telling us about the effects of trees on human health. A recent systematic review of 201 studies looked at how urban trees may impact human health.(2) This review revealed that study designs and results are extremely varied. However, exposure to trees in urban settings is associated with multiple health benefits.These benefits can be grouped into three main themes:1. Harm reduction (41% of studies)Urban trees, by removing a variety of air pollutants, reduce some of the negative health effects of pollution (for example, reducing the risk of lung cancer, respiratory problems and asthma, etc.). They reduce the risk of heat stroke, improve comfort in outdoor spaces during heatwaves, and thus reduce the risk of heat-related morbidity and mortality during heatwaves\xa0(a problem that particularly affects seniors). In addition, the shadow created by the foliage of the trees acts as a screen that blocks ultraviolet (UV) rays. Repeated and excessive exposure to UV rays can damage the skin, cause eye damage and increase the risk of skin cancer.Some studies have also found an association between the presence of trees and a reduction in crime! However, it is not easy to explain such a phenomenon. Some researchers speculate that it may be related to the calming effect of vegetation, or that urban forests promote better social cohesion within a community.In all cases, the benefits appear to vary depending on the species, size, location and state of health of the trees.2. Capacity restoration (31% of studies)Studies suggest that contact with nature or the sight of a forest landscape promotes better cognition and greater attention. Exposure to wooded environments can decrease anxiety, depression, anger, confusion and fatigue, with greater effects in people with higher initial stress levels. These benefits seem to be linked to biodiversity: a greater wealth of plant species promotes more mental well-being, in particular.3. Capacity building (28% of studies)Spending time in the forest, even for short periods of time, appears to enhance the immune system, as well as social well-being and a sense of community. Urban trees are linked to increased physical activity, resulting in decreased obesity and improved cardiovascular health. Trees in urban areas play an important role in our health and well-being. But these trees sometimes have a hard time in urban environments. For example, trees often do not have enough space for it to root. This can cause stress and strain on the tree, as well as damage to sewers, curbs, roads, walls, and other man-made structures nearby.(3)Participate in the greening of your communities. Several communities have joined the “Tree Cities of the World” program. This initiative aims to recognize cities and towns that are committed to ensuring that trees and urban forests are well maintained, sustainably managed, and celebrated as they should. Every year, towns and villages from around the world are giving citizens trees to plant on their property to help green their communities. Take part in these initiatives and help celebrate urban forests!""]"

This translates to approximately 10 million new cases of dementia every year (3). The large increase in cases is directly related to there being no known cure or effective prevention strategies at this time. In recent years, research has started to focus on the role of inflammation as a cause of dementia, as well as therapies to reduce and control inflammation. These therapies include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, celecoxib (Celebrex), naproxen (Aleve or Anaprox), and rofecoxib (Vioxx) (4). Aspirin and naproxen are over-the-counter medications that may already be in your kitchen cabinet, while celecoxib requires a prescription from a doctor. Use of all three comes with potential health risks. Aspirin has been shown to increase the risk of major bleeding in people without cardiovascular disease, while oral NSAIDs—such as celecoxib and naproxen—are linked to an increased risk of heart attack at varying doses and lengths of use (5;6). Interestingly, rofecoxib has been removed from the market over safety concerns, but this was a voluntary withdrawal initiated by its own manufactures (7). Confused by the desire to prevent dementia but not wanting to put yourself at an increased risk for other negative consequences? Let’s take a closer look at arecentsystematic reviewevaluating the effectiveness and safety of NSAID use for dementia prevention (4). Overall, the available evidence doesn’t support the use of aspirin or other NSAIDs to prevent dementia. More specifically, the review found that healthy older adults (no history of dementia, heart disease or physical disability) who take low-dose aspirin (100 mg per day) do not reduce their risk for developing dementia, compared to those taking aplacebo. Taking aspirin also does not make a difference in the ability to perform activities of daily living independently. However, those who take aspirin are 17% to 60% more likely to experience major bleeding, and 1% to 28% more likely to die. Although these results are based on one study, the study included over 19,000 participants and the evidence was rated as being of high certainty. This means it is unlikely new studies, if conducted, would change this finding. The authors even noted that due to the risks and lack of effects, we aren’t likely to see more studies on low-dose aspirin and dementia prevention. What about other NSAIDs? The results for other NSAIDs are also based on one study each. In cognitively healthy older adults who have a family history of Alzheimer's disease, celecoxib (200 mg twice per day) and naproxen (220 mg twice per day) were not found to reduce the incidence of Alzheimer's disease or increase the risk of stroke, heart attack, or death compared toplacebo. Celecoxib (200 mg or 400 mg per day) also did not improve cognition in older adults with age-related memory loss, but may increase the risk of gastrointestinal issues such as nausea, stomach pain, and conditions related to the lining of the stomach being inflamed. Finally, rofecoxib (25 mg once per day) may actually increase the risk of transitioning to a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease among those with mild cognitive impairment, as well as increase gastrointestinal issues compared toplacebo. It should be noted that all the studies included in the review were stopped early due to safety concerns and that the evidence for non-aspirin NSAIDs was rated as being of moderate to low certainty. This means there is a chance that future studies, which take into consideration safety issues, may find different results (4). Speak with your health care provider before starting or stopping any prescribed or over-the-counter medications in your efforts to hold off dementia. Although there are no foolproof strategies for dementia prevention, there are non-drug related tactics that we can use to help boost our cognitive health. These include combined physical activity and brain training for people with or without mild cognitive impairment, and visual art therapy and computerized brain games for people with mild cognitive impairment (8-10).""]"

While health systems are used to running vaccination campaigns, the global COVID-19 pandemic raises many challenges. For example, in a context of a limited supply of vaccine doses, who should be prioritized and on what grounds?To help Canadian decision-makers as they respond to unprecedented challenges related to the pandemic, theCOVID-19 Evidence Network to support Decision-making (COVID-END)has reviewed what is known about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.(1) This blog post is the second in a series which examine evidence and experiences from Canada and other countries about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. It focuses on the set of challenges facing decision-makers, most notably:- how to develop and adjust rules to allocate vaccines allocation rules;- what are those allocation rules; and- how to ensure equity in the allocation of vaccines and other necessary equipment.(1) The World Health Organization developed a framework consisting of six key principles to guide COVID-19 vaccine allocation and prioritization:1)human well-being(“protect and promote human well-being including health, social and economic security, human rights and civil liberties, and child development”); 2)equal respect(“recognize and treat all human beings as having equal moral status and their interests as deserving of equal moral consideration”); 3)global equity(“ensure equity in vaccine access and benefit globally among people living in all countries, particularly those living in low-and middle-income countries”); 4)national equity(“ensure equity in vaccine access and benefit within countries for groups experiencing greater burdens from the COVID-19 pandemic”); 5)reciprocity(“honor obligations of reciprocity to those individuals and groups within countries who bear significant additional risks and burdens of COVID-19 response for the benefit of society”); and 6)legitimacy(“make global decisions about vaccine allocation and national decisions about vaccine prioritization through transparent processes that are based on shared values, best available scientific evidence, and appropriate representation and input by affected parties”).(2) This is consistent national agencies have developed similar frameworks. For example, the U.S. Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommended an approach which is guided by four principles: 1) maximize benefits and minimize harms; 2) promote justice; 3) mitigate health inequities; and 4) promote transparency. These four principles should be accompanied by additional considerations based on the best available research evidence (for example, what is known about the safety and efficacy of vaccines) and the feasibility of the implementation of the vaccination campaign (for example, the storage and handling of vaccines).(3) This resonates with the allocation approach used in Canada. Indeed, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada indicated that equitable allocation of vaccines when there is limited supply needs to take into account who is most at risk of exposure and severe outcomes, feasibility and acceptability of the vaccine, as well as ethical considerations.(4) In light of these principles, most countries that have begun their vaccination campaigns have prioritized healthcare workers, long-term care residents, and some other at-risk populations (for example, older adults, individuals with chronic conditions, and at-risk adults in Indigenous communities).(1) As the mass-vaccination campaigns unfold, allocation rules and priorities may be adapted to respond to the supply of vaccines and other considerations (for example, the spread of new variants). In the third part of our series, we will examine the challenges of communicating how the vaccines will be allocated and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines.']"

Like that one piece of nutritional advice that’s been shared with us consistently throughout our lives. If you immediately thought of, “eat your fruits and vegetables,” then you’d be correct! Diet plays a major role in influencing our health and well-being (1-10). Fruits and vegetables are an essential part of a healthy diet. This notion is supported by Canada’s food guide, which lists consuming plenty of fruits and vegetables and favouring plant-based protein foods as “healthy food choices” (11). While the benefits of diets rich in fruits and vegetables are regularly discussed in relation to weight management and chronic disease prevention (3;10;12), we don’t generally hear much about the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables for our bones. When we consider the increased risk of fractures (a.k.a. broken bones) that is caused, in part, by reductions in bone density that occur as a natural part of aging and diseases such as osteoporosis that manifest as we age, it's important we implement strategies that reduce our risk for such injuries (13-15). So, can a dietary strategy like eating more fruits and vegetables help us reduce our risk of fractures?One systematic reviewset out to provide answers (13). The review found that adults aged 50 years old and over who increase their intake of fruits and vegetables may be between 2% and 13% less likely to experience a hip fracture (13). Although this reduction in risk is small, it’s not unimportant when we take into account that hip fractures cause significant illness, decrease independence, mobility, and quality of life, and increase mortality in older adults (16-20). A small decline in the risk of fractures at any site (not just the hips)—specifically, a 4% to 14% reduction—was also seen, and while this is positive, this result is only based on a couple of studies. As such, it needs to be interpreted with caution. With all of that said, there’s still a need for more research in this area so we can further solidify these findings and increase our confidence in what they reveal. Future research needs to include larger numbers of participants who are more diverse (13). You can’t go wrong with eating a healthy and well-balanced diet that’s rich in fruits and vegetables. The potential added benefits for your bones should only serve as one more reason to make a conscious effort to feature fruits and veggies on your plate.

The roll-out of the COVID-19 vaccines is arguably one of the largest health-system initiatives ever conducted. While health systems are used to running vaccination campaigns, the global COVID-19 pandemic raises many challenges. For example, research knowledge is still evolving about the virus (and new variants), there is still a push to develop and approve new vaccines, and there is a limited supply of vaccine doses. Making the situation even more challenging, some groups are expressing strong resistance to the COVID-19 vaccines which can lead to hesitancy to get vaccinated among many others due to a lack of information, mis-information or conspiracy theories.To help Canadian decision-makers as they respond to unprecedented challenges related to the pandemic, theCOVID-19 Evidence Network to support Decision-making(COVID-END) has reviewed what is known about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out.(1) More specifically, they examined what is known about five key domains:- securing and distributing a reliable supply of vaccines and necessary equipment (for example, needles and diluents);- allocating vaccines and necessary equipment equitably;- communicating how the vaccines will be allocated and the safety and effectiveness of vaccines;- administering vaccines in ways that optimize timely uptake; and- monitoring, evaluating and reporting on the vaccine roll-out. This blog post is the first in a series which examine evidence and experiences from Canada and other countries about the COVID-19 vaccine roll-out. The first set of challenges facing decision-makers have been to secure and distribute a reliable supply of vaccines and other necessary equipment. This includes planning for the following:- national purchasing agreements with vaccine developers to secure doses as they become available;- delivery of the vaccines and equipment to the country;- managing the inventory of vaccines within the country;- ordering within country;- distribution within the country and to administration sites (including whether directly from centralized distributors to administering locations and whether redistribution is allowed); and- storage and handling within country (for example, cold-chain requirements to maintain optimal conditions during the transport, storage, and handling of vaccines).(1) The World Health Organization (WHO) and leading national agencies like the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have developed guidelines related to the purchasing of vaccines and other supplies, as well as planning mass-vaccination campaigns.(2-3) Such guidelines are intended to support all countries in preparing and building readiness for the deployment of COVID-19 vaccines.Research shows that to end the COVID-19 pandemic, it is crucial to act globally. It is estimated that 60-80% of the world’s population must be vaccinated to achieve “herd immunity” for COVID-19.(4) According to the Mayo Clinic, herd immunity (sometimes referred as community immunity) occurs when a large portion of a community (the herd) becomes immune to a disease, which makes the spread of the disease from person to person unlikely. As a result, the whole community becomes protected (and not just those who are immune).(5) Therefore, there have been calls for international institutions, governments and vaccine manufacturers to plan for sufficient vaccine production and allocation, and negotiate vaccine prices that will be affordable for low- and middle-income countries.(5)The need to share COVID-19 vaccines globally in a more equitable way appears particularly challenging since high-income countries have secured more than half of the vaccine doses so far.(6) High-income countries have finalized advance purchasing agreements with vaccine developers to secure doses as they become available (in many occasions with multiple companies that have developed or are currently developing COVID-19 vaccines). For instance, Canada established advance purchasing agreements with seven companies that have developed or are currently developing COVID-19 vaccines. The doses secured are enough for all Canadians who wish to be vaccinated. But other countries like Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States have also re-purposed existing capacity and invested in new vaccine manufacturing capacity to help expedite the production of vaccines. Given the potential complexity of delivering COVID-19 vaccines to remote communities in both developed and developing countries, national and international vaccine supply chains should be strengthened. This will ensure that vaccines are distributed and administered efficiently to remote and rural populations, and to avoid any waste of vaccine doses.(4) And other challenges will most likely be revealed as the mass-vaccination campaigns unfold. In the second part of our series, we will examine the challenges of allocating vaccines and necessary equipment equitably (with a particular focus on deciding which populations should be prioritized).']"

These are just a few examples of common activities that often involve or encourage the consumption of alcohol. But just how prominent is drinking culture in Canada? Well, an estimated 80% of Canadians consume alcohol (1). Amongst those who drink, nearly six million engage in heavy drinking (2). For females, this translates into drinking four or more alcoholic beverages during one event, at least once a month, while for males, that number is five or more drinks (3). Heavy drinking can lead to the development of alcohol use disorder, a behavioural condition that gives rise to cognitive, emotional, and physical issues that increase disability and decrease lifespan (4-7). A diverse collection of treatment options, such as medications, psychological therapies, and recovery support programs, exist to help those struggling with alcohol misuse and dependence achieve and maintain abstinence (4;6). In particular, recovery support programs are appealing because they are widely available and often offered at little to no cost (6;8;9). Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), a group-based 12-step program that focuses on peer-to-peer support and is delivered within community settings, is one example of this type of service (6;10). Overtime, AA has inspired the development of professionally-led Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) programs whose main goal is to connect people to AA groups in their community (6;11). We know that these types of programs are popular. So, should you join the millions of folks using them or advocate their use to loved ones? Arecentsystematic reviewtook on the task of evaluating the effects of these programs in people battling alcohol use disorder, alcohol abuse, or alcohol dependence (6). It was found that people engaging in peer-led AA/professionally-led TSF programs that follow standardized guidelines for delivery are anywhere from 3% to up to 42% more likely to abstain from alcohol use compared to people using other recognized treatments—such as cognitive behavioural therapy (e.g., CBT). These AA/TSF programs may also be as effective as other recognized treatments—such as CBT—in reducing alcohol-related consequences (e.g., mental, physical, and social impacts). Additionally, AA/TSF programs may potentially be more beneficial or equally as beneficial for outcomes such as percentage of days abstinent (long-term), drinking intensity (e.g., drinks consumed per drinking day or percentage of days heavy drinking), and addiction severity. However, our confidence in the findings for these last three outcomes is quite low given the small number of studies and the small number of participants, so more research is needed before more definitive conclusions can be drawn. These results, coupled with the likelihood that community support programs are more easily accessible than other treatment options, illuminate why AA and similar interventions are indeed popular and worth a try or suggestion to a loved one (6). If you’re personally in need of support, speak with your health care provider about suggestions for programs or search online for ones available in your community. You might find that many in-person programs have been cancelled due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. However, many of them are being offered virtually though platforms like Zoom instead.']"

It has also exacerbated other types of pandemics, such as violence against women. Indeed, in 2018, the Secretary General of the United Nations declared that violence against women should be recognized as a “global pandemic.”(1) This pandemic of violence continues against the backdrop of another pandemic.It is recognized that pandemics can exacerbate gender inequalities and impact the way women receive treatment and care.(2-3) Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, government authorities and human-rights groups in many countries denounce an increase in reports of violence, as well as an increase in requests for emergency accommodation.(2-3) Measures to prevent and control infections (whether physical distancing, confinement, quarantine, curfew, business closures) may have had an impact on family dynamics through their effects on family income, social connections, well-being and mental health.Such observations resonate with the results of a moderate-quality systematic review that was recently published.(4) This review examined the scientific literature on violence against women during periods of physical distancing and confinement in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.The analysis of 38 articles revealed an increase in calls to helplines and contact with services and organizations for victims of violence. That said, the review points out that the number of reports is probably underestimated. Indeed, many factors seem to hamper reporting and accessing help services. Obstacles include aggressive and controlling behaviour of the abuser, close proximity to the abuser during confinement that does not allow the victim to report, fear of being infected with COVID-19, and a disruption or reduction in social support and protection services during the pandemic. Moreover, it also seems difficult to implement interventions with friends and family members due to their fear of contracting the virus.The review also identified four types of factors increasing women\'s vulnerability to violence during the pandemic:1. individual factors(whether stress, impulsivity, anxiety, depression, mental health problems; loss of employment and income; financial difficulties; use of alcohol and other drugs ; fear of infections; feeling of uncertainty; a history of violence; or an increase in unpaid work and childcare responsibilities);2. interpersonal factors(whether it is partner dependence; the need to spend more time near the abuser; increased controlling behaviours; or decreased social contact and support by peers);3. community factors(limited access to social networks; restricted access to health and social services; or the availability of alcohol, drugs and weapons); and4. societal factors(the health, economic and social crises generated by the pandemic; restrictions on movement; limited access to justice and social protection systems; social norms regarding the role of men and women; idealized representations of home and family; or the absence of policies against violence against women).The review points out that the pandemic is forcing many victims to turn to the telephone helplines and virtual channels like websites and messaging apps to seek help. However, the review underlines the security issues for victims who seek help while their abuser is confined with them.Health and social professionals appear to have a crucial role in detecting, identifying and reporting cases of violence. Telemedicine services have been proposed in order to play a role, but all of this must be done with the consideration of the need to ensure the privacy and security of women. For example, during virtual care sessions, it is recommended that professionals use closed questions to check women\'s safety, the use of colour codes or specific codes in case of danger, and offer their services on a flexible schedule to take advantage of absences of the abuser.Violence against women is a tragic and complex phenomenon, especially since this ""shadow pandemic"" is unfolding against the background of a health pandemic. However, we must act proactively and not remain silent in the face of such violence.']"

The âartâ of improving cognitive ability and mental wellbeing,"['Art is a powerful tool that allows us to express creativity, thoughts, and feelings. Some even say that “art is food for the soul,” but can it also be “food for the mind”? Worldwide, cases of dementia are set to increase from 50 million to 152 million within the next 30 years (1). Research has responded to this projection by placing the spotlight on improving cognition in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In particular, the emphasis has been on approaches such as physical activity and cognitive training (traditionally brain games) (2-4). A recentsystematic reviewis now shifting the focus to an alternative form of cognitive training known as visual art therapy (5). For those not familiar, folks engaging in visual art therapy use different supplies and methods to create artwork. The push to express this creativity may come naturally or be encouraged by others like peers or therapists (5-7). Visual art therapy can involve: planning, making decisions related to the piece (e.g., what materials and techniques to use), thinking outside the box, talking about the artwork, relationship building through interactions with therapists and peers, reflection on past experiences, reconciling certain emotions and conflicts, and coming to resolutions. These elements demonstrate how this approach can contribute to cognitive stimulation; while also highlighting its therapeutic characteristics (5;7-9). Sounds promising; let’s examine the evidence. The recent review looked at older adults with normal cognition, MCI, or dementia. These individuals engaged in supervised, group-based visual art therapy with activities such as drawing, painting, and coloring abstract patterns. They were then compared to folks not partaking in an activity or involved in other events such as theatre art, recreational activities, or singing. The review found that visual art therapy may improve cognitive function by a large amount in older adults with MCI, but may have no effect on those with normal cognition. The opposite can be said for depression. Visual art therapy may moderately reduce depressive symptoms in those with normal cognition or dementia, but may have no effect in those with MCI. The results for anxiety where not separated by cognitive health status. Overall, it was demonstrated that visual art therapy might slightly reduce anxiety in older adults with or without cognitive decline. More research is needed to explore the use of visual art therapy as a preventative strategy for cognitive decline and establish the most effective programs (5). You don’t need to be Pablo Picasso to tap into your artistic side. Look into visual art therapy programs available in your community. Due to COVID-19, where in-person programs are not recommended, look for online programs that can be done at home while still getting the benefits of supervision and group interaction. So, choose your art medium and give it a go!']"

This type of intervention is mainly used in healthcare facilities, in rehabilitation programs or in groups of people with chronic conditions. The topics of writing can be varied, according to individual inspiration, and the writing exercises allow patients to get to know each other better or to promote the process of self-healing. When writing is done as part of a group activity, being part of the group and feeling supported seem to be a big part of the intervention.2- Expressive writing that is not guidedIn writing interventions that are not guided by a facilitator, writing instructions are given in writing, by telephone or by video. Participants are encouraged to write at home on their own. There is no advice or feedback on the written material. Usually, only one writing topic can be chosen, usually focusing on a disease or treatment, in which participants are invited to reveal their deepest thoughts and feelings, in an expressive way.Review findings suggest that guided therapeutic writing is a complex intervention and that group interaction contributes to the perceived benefits. However, there is currently little evidence on the effectiveness of non-directed expressive writing interventions.Either way, whether the activity is done individually or in a group, people need motivation to initiate and continue the writing activity. You need to find an initial incentive to try the experiment, and then you have to feel the benefits so that you don\'t give up. Of note, it seems that the majority of participants perceive psychological benefits in releasing their emotions. Putting traumatic events into words and structuring their emotions into a story helps release deep feelings and helps the healing process.Writing can help people take a step back from an event, think differently about the situation. This can lead to behavioural changes and the desire to change some aspect of someone\'s life. Whether it\'s writing your memoirs, writing poetry, keeping a journal, sharing the isolation you feel because of the COVID-19 pandemic or recounting joyful events, writing will allow you to release your emotions and be entertained.Seek writing programs available in virtual groups to experience the benefits of writing as part of a group. Experienced authors (some being internationally renowned) offer online ""master classes"" to share writing tips. This is the case of Quebec author Janette Bertrand who launched anonline writing workshop(in partnership with the Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal) to encourage older adults to write their life stories.Why not start your own writing group with some family members or friends? Share your writing with them and meet up online every week to discuss it.Challenge yourself to write a little bit every day, on a topic that matters to you.

In particular, agitation, which affects nearly 90% of dementia patients (5;6), obstructs a patient’s ability to engage in essential or desired activities, hinders relationships, decreases quality of life, and is even a factor in achieving admittance into nursing homes (7-10). For informal and formal caregivers, patient agitation also gives rise to feelings of powerlessness, stress, and poor health outcomes (1;11-13). Given that medications used to treat agitation, such as anti-psychotics, are not highly effective and come with potentially serious risks, you may be wondering if non-drug options are an effective alternative (7;14). The answer based on arecentsystematic reviewis…yes, some can be (5)! The non-drug options assessed in this review include: massage therapy (e.g., hand or foot massages), interventions personally tailored to people’s abilities and interests, animal-assisted interventions (e.g., petting, brushing, and feeding a dog), pet robot interventions, light therapy, music therapy, reminiscence therapy, aromatherapy, physical exercise, dementia-care mapping, and horticultural therapy (i.e., related to plants and gardening). People engaging in these non-drug approaches were generally compared to people receiving usual care or a placebo (e.g., educational presentations, water sprays, etc.). The results demonstrate that massage therapy may lead to moderate decreases in agitation among adults with dementia, compared to usual care or placebo, while personally tailored interventions, animal-assisted interventions, and pet robot interventions may bring about small decreases in agitation. Benefits were not seen with any of the other seven non-drug approaches evaluated (5). If you’re a person with dementia or a caregiver of someone with this condition and are struggling with agitation management, try adding a non-drug option to your treatment arsenal. With several approaches showing potential, there is more choice and a better chance of finding a strategy that works for you or your loved one. A health care provider can help with incorporating new approaches into your plan.']"

For those who progress to dementia, these cognitive declines are combined with decreases in functioning, resulting in less independence and a reduced ability to complete basic activities of daily living (2;3)—such as getting dressed, maintaining proper hygiene, and eating. It is evident that the toll these conditions have on the lives of those diagnosed can be heavy. So, it is not surprising that many people with MCI and dementia also develop depression (4). When you consider that millions of people live with MCI and approximately 50 million people live with dementia, it is clear that strategies that help people cope with the existing or impending negative mental health impacts are needed (1;5). One recentsystematic reviewlooked at the effect of cognitive training on symptoms of depression in people with MCI or dementia. Here, cognitive training was an umbrella term used to encompass several different approaches. First, there was computerized cognitive training, which involved people being instructed to complete a task through the use of a computer. Second, there was cognitive training and rehabilitation, which required people to complete tasks that used particular mental processes such as memory or attention while under personalized guidance or direction. Third, there was cognitive stimulation therapy, which had people participating in programs with themed activities, one example being reminiscence therapy (e.g., the use of various senses to trigger memories). These programs were led by professionals (4). With various approaches available, let’s dig deeper into what each has to offer from a mental health perspective. The review found several encouraging results when comparing depression in people receiving cognitive training vs. those receiving usual care, participating in social and recreational activities, or exposed to other psychosocial strategies. Overall, cognitive training may reduce depression severity by a moderate amount. More specifically, computerized cognitive training and cognitive stimulation therapy both yield similar results—moderate reductions in depression severity, as opposed to cognitive training and rehabilitation, which may reduce depression severity by a small amount (4). Taking action to improve mental well-being is one approach to achieving an enhanced quality of life. If you or someone you care for has MCI or dementia, consider trying or suggesting they try cognitive training. Consulting with a health professional for more information on cognitive training and what strategy works best for your specific circumstance is always a great place to start.']"

Games of Scrabble, Trivial Pursuit, Monopoly, Chess, Go, or Rummy?Many people enjoy board games of all kinds, whether they be logic games, numbers, letters, sudokus... Some board games have been around for millennia! Many older adults are fans of these games because they are fun recreational activities that allow them to maintain social contacts.What is known about the effects of board games on the quality of life or physical and cognitive functions of older adults? A recent systematic review of 27 studies looked at the effectiveness of health programs that use board games.(1)Despite a limited number of studies and a lack of comparison with control groups, researchers have found that board games have positive effects on knowledge, cognitive functions, physical activity, anxiety, and severity of Alzheimer's disease (to name just a few).Effects on knowledgeResearch evidence also shows that board games can improve memory, but also increase and maintain cerebral agility, the speed of information processing, concentration, creativity, and sense of strategy.Some board games are specially developed with the aim of increasing knowledge in a particular field in order to promote behaviour changes, for example in relation to smoking, nutrition, road safety or to prevent HIV infection. In addition, the use of board games can help increase the benefits of an intervention or treatment among older adults by increasing their motivation to adopt certain health-promoting behaviours or to continue treatment.Effects on cognitive functions and other conditionsVarious strategy games can improve cognitive functions, such as chess and Go (an Asian strategy game). Studies have found improvement in attention and memory in older adults with dementia or living in nursing homes after regularly playing Go. This game is believed to improve symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Board games may also play a role in preventing the onset of this disorder. Chess studies have shown that game training improves the planning ability of patients with schizophrenia.Note that you don't have to speak in order to play many board games. Therefore, board games appear promising in therapies for patients with speech disorders, for example. With the cold weather setting in and the lockdown period due to the COVID-19 pandemic continuing, board games could become part of your arsenal to face coming months!- Take your board games out of the closet so that you can play with other people who are under the same roof as you.- Give board games to your loved ones as a gift so that they can also experience pleasant moments within their own bubble.- Install board games on your computer or mobile device so you can play with family and friends that you haven't seen in weeks.- Use a video chat app to play with someone far away from you.The pandemic prevents us from participating in the traditional social activities of the holiday season and the new year. But board games (including their digital versions) can help us to break social isolation with fun activities.""]"

What role do web-based decision aids play in decision making around prostate cancer screening?,"['Soup or salad, when the best time to retire is, what your end-of-life care wishes are. From the mundane to the life-altering, every day, we are faced with a laundry list of decisions that need to be made in order for us to move forward. Health-related decisions, in particular, often come with a lot of complex and sensitive information to mull over, and their impact on our lives—be it positive or negative—has the potential to be substantial. As a result, these types of decisions can be incredibly difficult to make. Take, for example, whether or not to undergo prostate cancer screening. The five-year survival rate for males with prostate cancer is approximately 100% if caught early vs. 30% if caught at a more advanced stage (1). If you‘re thinking, surely this helps to make the case for prostate cancer screening, think again. The decision to get screened, generally via the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, isn’t so cut and dry. In fact, some experts suggest that the benefits associated with the PSA test don’t outweigh the potential risks, while others suggest they do (2-4). The decision to be screened for any disease, including prostate cancer, should involve the weighing of the pros and cons along with one’s personal preferences. It can be overwhelming to consider all of the factors. However, help is available in the form of patient decision aids. Patient decision aids come in print, video, and web-based formats, with the latter gaining increased attention due to the anonymity it provides and its affordability and accessibility (5). Onesystematic reviewlooked at the effects of males using web-based decision aids for decision making around prostate cancer screening. The review found that web-based decision aids can increase knowledge—for instance around available screening options and associated outcomes—in males who use them vs. males who receive usual care. Some evidence within the review also suggests the potential for several additional benefits and highlights a couple of interesting points. First, in comparison to usual care, web-based decision aids may decrease uncertainty around choosing between different options, and reduce decision making that’s controlled by a health practitioner. However, it may have no effect on patient participation in decision-making or prostate cancer screening behaviour, compared to usual care. Second, web-based decision aids may be comparable to printed decision aids with respect to patient knowledge, feelings of uncertainty about which choice to make, participation in decision making, and screening behaviour. Third, in comparison to those who use video-based decision aids, people using web-based decision aids may have lower levels of patient knowledge, and may slightly change screening behaviours by decreasing the use of PSA tests. With that said, because these results are based on a small number of studies, more research is needed to compare different decision aid formats, especially in the long-term, and to take a closer look at the features of web-based decisions aids (5). If you: 1) are interested in being involved in decisions related to your health, 2) would simply like to be better aware of the options available to you, and/or 3) are gathering knowledge to inform discussions with your health care provider, consider trying one of the many different forms of decision aids available. Reflect on your own learning preferences (e.g., written, multimedia, or web), which aspect of the decision-making process you’d like to improve, and factors like access and cost when choosing a type of decision aid.For those in favour of a web-based format or who are looking for a place to start, the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal helps link you to several quality-rated web-based decision aids on prostate cancer screening.

Early retirement may also be desirable in the context of a pandemic which makes working conditions particularly difficult. That being said, some older workers may also feel pressured into retirement because of the prevailing ageism in their workplace, or may find it difficult to take on new professional challenges.What does research tell us about ageism and strategies to combat it in the workplace? A recent systematic review of 39 studies looked at ageism in the workplace in Western countries.(2) Three main themes were identified:1) The discrimination experienced by older workersSome older workers argue that the ageism they face appears to be related to perceptions about their physical abilities, work abilities and learning abilities, certain health issues and even their over-qualification.Studies show that ageism can also be exacerbated by other factors such as gender, social class and ethnicity. These factors can increase the vulnerability of some older workers.All sectors are affected by ageism, even the health sector. Studies support that healthcare workers have reported negative stereotypes of older people in healthcare settings. Such stereotypes can have serious consequences, such as influencing the allocation of resources between patient groups and the treatments offered.2) How society defines agingIn a society obsessed with youth and beauty, aging is often viewed as a negative process. This is reflected by:• recruiters who have internalized certain stereotypes and who may prefer younger candidates;• healthcare workers who are reluctant to specialize in gerontology; or• government policies that contribute to the idea that older adults must be active and healthy to be useful to society.Another element that contributes to this negative perception is that of the ""normative life course"", that is, the ""normal"" or ""standardized"" progression that each age group should have. This translates into a number of ways, including:• the marginalization of people who deviate from this path, for example people who start studies at an advanced age;• greater difficulties in re-entering the labour market in the event of a job loss, as this deviates from the traditional professional path which implies uninterrupted progression until retirement (and in the event of job loss, older workers are sometimes redirected to lower paid, unskilled and precarious jobs); or• less training and promotions offered to older workers, which reinforces the idea that they cannot learn new things or face new professional challenges.3) Strategies to counter ageismStudies show that different strategies are used by individuals and organizations to counter ageism in the workplace.Adaptation strategiesThe main coping resource is social support, which enables older workers to increase their sense of personal worth and professional belonging.In their work environment, older workers sometimes adjust in many different ways. While some will fight openly against discrimination, others will prefer to accept this reality and focus on the positive aspects of life outside of work.Identity strategiesWhether you feel old or young depends on personal identity, which is fluid and influenced by social relationships and environmental factors. Thus, some older workers are fighting ageism and want to strengthen their professional identity. Others internalize the prevailing stereotypes: some quickly adopt a new identity, that of future retirees.In the workplace, some leaders are trying to put in place strategies to be more inclusive for older workers. However, studies show that these measures sometimes have the opposite effect, as some managers are so afraid of behaving inappropriately towards older workers. This may cause them to avoid them instead and thus reinforce their exclusion. If you are employed or looking for a job and believe you are being discriminated against because of your age, remember that this is illegal. You cannot be refused a job, training or promotion, or forced to retire because of your age. Recourse is possible with your organization, provincial and territorial human rights organizations, or courts which may have jurisdiction depending on the circumstances.']"

What are older adults using cannabis for? It turns out the majority, 52 % to be exact, use cannabis solely for medical purposes, 24% use it only for non-medical purposes, and 24% use it for a combination of both (1). With an increased interest in cannabis to help treat or cope with various health conditions and side effects of treatments, it is important to be aware of whether or not the evidence supports these claims and the safety of cannabis use. Let’s take a deeper dive into the evidence-base around cannabis use for three common conditions: cancer, chronic nerve pain, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Click on the links below to find out more about the research and myth-busting results. 1. Cannabis for side effects of cancer treatment? The majority of cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy experience distressing side effects like nausea and vomiting (2;3). The standard approach for dealing with these side effects is the use of anti-sickness medications. Cannabinoids, which are active chemicals found in cannabis, are an alternative approach (4). Research shows that cannabinoids may help people going through chemotherapy manage the accompanying nausea and vomiting, and may even be as effective as the standard approach. However, potential benefits may come with an increased risk of other side effects, such as dizziness, sedation, disorientation, or uneasiness. These findings are based on studies of low to moderate quality. As such, more research that is of higher quality and takes into account newer cancer therapies and anti-sickness medications is needed to increase our certainty in the results (5). Weeding out the truth: Cannabis-based medications for cancer patients 2. Cannabis for chronic nerve pain? Nerve pain is caused by nerve damage that stems from a variety of factors, including illness, injury, and even surgery (6;7). It is often treated using pain relieving medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or opioids, although not generally with a great degree of success (7;8). Research demonstrates that cannabis-based medications may relieve pain and reduce pain intensity, psychological distress, and sleep problems in adults with chronic nerve pain. But, once again, alongside these potential benefits may come unwanted side effects such as confusion, psychosis, and sedation. These findings are grounded in very-low to moderate quality evidence. Therefore, more high quality research is needed to establish effectiveness and safety, especially studies focusing on older populations (8). Cannabis for chronic nerve pain: A half-baked solution? 3. Cannabis for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis? Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory conditions that impact an individual’s digestive tract (9). Both are a type of IBD (10). Treatment often consists of prescription medications that induce and maintain disease remission, but come with an increased risk of serious side effects such as liver problems and cancer (9;11). Research illustrates that cannabis cigarettes and cannabis oil do not appear to help with remission or inflammation in people with active Crohn’s or colitis; however cannabis cigarettes may reduce disease activity in both IBD subtypes, while cannabis oil may enhance quality of life. Certain improvements were accompanied by increased side effects in people with Crohn’s—such as drowsiness, memory loss, and issues with concentration—and colitis—such as headaches, fatigue, and dizziness. It is also important to be aware that these results were based on a small number of studies with a very small number of participants. So, ultimately, no concrete conclusions can be made at this time, and further research is needed (9;12). Does cannabis offer new hope for folks with Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis? Considerations for cannabis use Overall, evidence on the use of cannabis and cannabis-based products for cancer, nerve pain, and IBD is limited and comes from fairly low quality research. This makes it difficult to make strong conclusions on effectiveness and safety. The big question you might be asking is, ""what does this all mean for me""? First, it means trying to stay up-to-date on the evolving evidence-base around this topic, especially as new research comes out. Second, if you are contemplating using cannabis for medical purposes, remember to discuss the issue with your health care provider before commencing. Lastly, always weigh out the pros and cons for you as an individual. For some people the side effects might outweigh any benefits, while for others the opposite may be true (e.g., people not responding to traditional treatments). This assessment process is something a health professional can help you with, as is the development of a tailored treatment plan.']"

There are indeed several advantages to aging in place: a feeling of belonging, participation in community life, neighborhood support, better physical and mental health.As the level of autonomy and needs evolve, it may become more challenging to meet the care needs of older adults at home. It may be necessary to look to other types of housing arrangements. Some will offer more flexible and adaptable physical arrangements, as well as better access to care and services, and allow you to socialize and participate in activities.If you think you might have to explore other housing arrangements, but are still active and independent, what are your options? A recent systematic review identified 46 studies examining community-based housing models that support aging in place.(1) Five models were identified:-Village-type modelsare neighborhoods for older adults offering residents access to services, activities and amenities to promote independent living and active social life within the community.(2) -Naturally occurring retirement communitiesare communities with a large proportion of residents over the age of 60. These communities, however, were not specifically planned or designed to meet the needs of older adults living independently in their homes. These communities evolve naturally as people age in place or migrate to the same region.(3) Housing decisions are complex and sensitive. It's worth being proactive and planning ahead.- Think about your current and future needs, but also your personal values and preferences (and feel free to communicate them).- Discuss the different options available with your loved ones and your health and social services professionals (and don't forget to consider whether home modifications, the addition of services or new assistive technologies would allow you to remain in your own home).""]"

The benefits of modifying exercise for people with health conditions,"['Physical activity, an issue so important that each year the world dedicates an entire day to encouraging people to get up and get moving. But just because April 6th is officially World Physical Activity Day, it doesn’t mean we should forget about being physically active the other 364 days of the year. In fact, for the sake of our own physical, mental, and cognitive health, we need to be active every day (1-6). Globally, it’s estimated that between 110 million and 190 million adults face substantial functional limitations due to aging, health conditions, and other factors (7). Despite this, getting and staying physically active needs to be a priority. This notion is supported by international guidelines, which recommend that people with a health condition continue to be as physically active as their circumstance allows (8-10). One approach to help keep people with functional limitations active is seated exercise (8). But does it lead to health benefits for older adults? Arecentsystematic reviewlooked at the impact of seated exercise programs on impairment (e.g., cognition) and activity (e.g., mobility) in older adults with a health condition or impairment. Exercise programs were generally supervised, group-based, and varied in terms of program structure, composition, and setting. Examples of exercise types within these programs include progressive and non-progressive resistance/strength training, tai chi, and dance therapy. The review found that seated exercise programs may improve cognition in older adults with a health condition or impairment, compared to receiving usual care or engaging in social activities. However, similar benefits were not seen for mobility or balance. In terms of safety, seated exercise programs seem to be classified as generally safe, although in some instances muscle soreness, joint pain, and back pain were reported. Although more research is needed to determine if seated exercise can positively impact outcomes such as mobility and balance, given its potentially positive impact on cognition, it may be a good alternative for older adults with functional limitations (8). Chronic health conditions—be it those that leave you short of breath, impair vision, or decrease balance—can make it harder to engage in physical activity. But exercises can be modified to help overcome some barriers. Consider a seated exercise program, but first speak with your health care provider about the benefits and risks, ideal program components and delivery formats for your specific circumstance, and precautions you can take to engage in exercise more safely.']"

A recent, moderate-quality systematic review identified 33 studies on the subject.(2) These studies examined the effects of different types of interventions on drivers aged 55 and over, most notably on their knowledge of road safety, their perception of road safety and their capabilities, as well as their actual driving performance.The interventions aimed to increase capacity through:1. education, by providing information on road safety rules, common driving errors and strategies to avoid these errors, self-regulatory driving strategies, or positioning in a vehicle.2. physical exercise, offering an exercise program to improve range of motion, strength, dexterity and coordination, core stability and shoulder flexibility.3. cognitive training, through various activities or computer simulations to promote processing speed, reasoning and visual perception.Are these interventions effective? Research evidence show that:- classroom instruction or a combination of classroom instruction with feedback on the road has improved knowledge of road safety;- tailored training improves knowledge of road safety, modifies self-perception of driving skills and improves driving performance for older drivers;- discussions between older drivers and health professionals during training increase self-regulating driving practices (and thus help drivers to adjust their driving to different stimuli); and- approaches involving different professionals promote behaviour change and lead to improved driving skills. If you are an older driver and have doubts about your driving, find out about:- how your health status could affect your driving;- training programs, technologies and conditions (for example, do not drive at night, wear corrective glasses, or drive a\xa0vehicle with automatic transmission) that would maintain or increase your safety and your driving performance;- provincial and territorial laws relating to the conditions for maintaining your driver's license (for example, compulsory medical checks); and- transportation alternatives that may be available in your community.And remember, it is not a driver's age that matters, but rather their health.(3) Driving is a complex activity whether you are young or old.""]"

They also brought with them many projections for what the future could look like. One forecast, in particular, concerned the leading causes of death and disability worldwide (1). And within it, researchers suggested that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease—more commonly known as COPD—might go from being the sixth leading cause of death in 1990 to the third leading cause of death by 2020 (1;2). Fast forward 26 years to 2016, and this prophecy did indeed become a reality (3). If we zero in on the lungs of someone with COPD, we see damage to or changes in the structure of the primary airways, smaller passageways, and air sacs (2). In turn, these contribute to difficulty breathing, a common symptom of COPD (4). Now, imagine trying to go about your day—be it walking your dog, making dinner, cleaning your house, or taking a shower—when you start experiencing an intense bout of shortness of breath, which causes you to stop what you are doing. This example highlights how routine daily activities can be impacted for people living with COPD. However, there are strategies that help control symptoms and enhance wellbeing. While medication is one of the most common approaches, pulmonary rehabilitation—which involves a combination of exercise, education, and lifestyle changes—is another (2;4). Pulmonary rehabilitation is often done in clinical settings such as hospitals, but access to these services can be enhanced through home or community-based options. This gives rise to two main questions. First, how do home or community-based rehabilitation impact symptoms and wellbeing in people with COPD? Second, how do home or community-based strategies stack up against hospital-based rehabilitation?Onesystematic reviewtook on this investigation (2). The review found a couple of promising results. For instance, in comparison to people with COPD who do not receive treatment, those who engage in home or community-based rehabilitation can experience improvements in breathing and quality of life. Even more interesting, it appears that home or community-based rehabilitation may be as effective as hospital-based rehabilitation in achieving positive benefits related to ease of breathing, oxygen use during exercise, and quality of life (2). So, do not waste your breath! If you face barriers to accessing hospital-based services, prefer the comfort of home, or like the convenience that comes along with staying within your community, speak with your health care provider about the home and community-based rehabilitation options available to you.']"

For instance, measures to prevent and control the spread of the infection like physical distancing, confinement and quarantine has clearly affected our social and professional life. Decisions to adapt the health and social systems to the pandemic (for example, closing ambulatory clinics, adapting cancer treatments, delaying elective procedures, or prioritizing the use of virtual care) has also affected our capacity to manage our health and care.But among all those affected since the start of the pandemic, one group has met incredible challenges: caregivers. In Canada, approximately one in four\xa0Canadians\xa0aged 15 and older (roughly 8 million people) are caregivers to friends or family with a long-term health condition or aging-related needs.(1) Caregivers have always been considered a key pillar of health and social systems since much of the burden of continuing care falls on them.(2) Caregivers play many important roles: helping the care team identify the health and social care needs of older adults; taking notes and asking questions; providing emotional support; accompanying older adults to medical appointments; reporting or managing side effects; giving medication; keeping track of medicines, test results and papers; providing physical care (for example, feeding, dressing and bathing); coordinating home and community care, primary care and specialty care; advocating to access the necessary care; keeping family and friends informed; making legal and financial arrangements; and the list goes on... And despite their crucial roles, caregivers often lack access to practical, social, emotional, and financial support.(3; 4) An Ontario report revealed that more than one in four individuals receiving care at home were relying on a caregiver who experienced “continued distress, anger or depression in relation to their caregiving role.”(5) And then came the pandemic, which turned the lives of caregivers upside down and has made their roles even more complex.In a recent webinar, caregivers highlighted how the pandemic exacerbated their burden. They talked about the increased stress, burnout, depression, anxiety and isolation experienced since the beginning of the pandemic. They highlighted the difficulty of securing basic goods (for example, grocery shopping, cleaning supplies), as well as dealing with the reduction in health and social service available.The pandemic also brought a whole new array of preoccupations\xa0for caregivers who must keep the home as a safe and infection-free environment for their loved ones, which can be difficult and stressful. Using masks and other personal protective equipment, maintaining physical distancing, disinfecting everything that home care provider touches remain complex. Caregivers may no longer be able to get help from the broader family/friend network outside the home due to concerns related to COVID-19. And concerns remain about home care providing coming into their home to provide service (where have they been, have they been exposed to COVID-19). While we are only beginning to appreciate the impacts of COVID-19, many of these impacts may continue post-COVID.If you are a caregiver, theOntario Caregiver Organizationhas a few tips for you:- prepare acontingency planin case you become ill or unable to provide care to your loved ones;- find opportunities to share positive stories and acknowledge those in your circle of care;- keep a regular and healthy routine;- stay connected and maintain your social networks; and- make sure to attend to your own needs.More than ever, we need one another.

This is demonstrated by the fact that 1 in 4 adults don’t get an adequate amount of exercise—making lack of physical activity one of the top risk factors for death across the globe (6). What’s stopping people, namely older adults, from putting on their running shoes and signing up for an exercise class or program in their community? It turns out there are a variety of hurdles to overcome, including those that are financial (e.g., cost), physical (e.g., illness), and social (e.g., not having an exercise buddy) (7-10). To get a better picture of why some older adults may not be joining in on exercise opportunities, we must also consider that fitness environments—such as gyms or recreational centres—tend to better accommodate the needs, wants, and preferences of younger populations. Additionally, exercise programs tend to be delivered by younger health professionals, widening the gap between those developing and leading these programs and those potentially attending them (7). In response to some of these barriers, anovelsystematic reviewexamined whether peer-led exercise programs and peer support programs were effective in motivating older adults to exercise, as well as their influence on health outcomes. Within the review, peer-led exercise programs involved trained older adults delivering the program. On the other hand, peer support programs involved older adults who provided participants with advice, encouragement, education, and mentorship alongside health professionals who delivered the program. Overall, the review highlights that peer-led exercise programs may be effective in preserving older adult participation in exercise programs, and potentially to the same degree as programs that are led by professionals. What’s more, a positive impact on adherence may also be seen for peer-support programs. That said, a small number of studies included in the review found that peer-led programs weren’t more effective in improving health outcomes like physical function. Since this is the first review to tackle this topic, more research, which includes larger numbers of participants, is needed to gain a better understanding of the effects of peer-led programs and peer support on physical function (7). In order to reap the rewards of exercise, the Canadian Physical Activity Guidelines recommend that adults aged 18 years and older take part in exercises that build muscle and strengthen bones at least twice a week. Additionally, aerobic exercise should be performed for a minimum of 150 minutes each week at moderate- to- vigorous intensity (1). If you’re having trouble meeting these standards on your own, consider finding an exercise program within your community that is led by trained peers or includes elements of peer-support. It may give you the extra push you need.""]"

Are you unsatisfied with the treatments received? Have you been taken seriously? Have you felt infantilized? Have you been able to make an appointment with your provider?Each year, many patients, families and caregivers who interact with the health and social systems experience dissatisfaction and adverse events. For example, in 2019 alone, the Ontario Patient Ombudsman received more than 2,400 complaints.(1) These complaints can affect all sectors, including hospital care, primary care, or home and community care.Complaints mechanisms can play different roles. They can help to better meet the needs of patients and to listen to them. But these are also mechanisms for learning and improvement. Indeed, patients, families and caregivers have a unique point of view in the health and social systems. They are able to recognize a range of problems in the continuum of care, some of which are not identified by traditional surveillance systems.(2)But what do we know about the nature of complaints and their effects? A recent moderate-quality systematic review examined 21 articles on the nature and effects of complaints about general medical care.(3) Researchers wanted to know what motivates individuals to make complaints, but also what were the effects of complaints on patients, providers and affected systems. Studies have found that complaints generally relate to three main types of issues:1) clinical issues, with regard to the quality of care (for example, inadequate patient assessment or unsatisfactory treatment) or the safety of care (for example, treatment of the wrong patient, misdiagnosis or misinterpretation of the diagnosis);2) management issuesin healthcare settings (for example, cleanliness of the physical environment or a faulty telephone system) or in institutional processes (for example, long waiting lists, cancelled appointments, or out-of-pocket expenses); and3) relationship issues, with respect to the rights of patients (for example, alleged assaults, rude behaviours, breaches of confidentiality, or discrimination) or communication (for example, the patient does not appear to be taken seriously, inadequate explanations are offered by providers, or inability to receive care in one's own language). The motivations have been less studied so far. Only two of the articles included in the review described patients' motivations for filing a complaint. Motivations included a desire for someone to be held accountable for a problem, to seek disciplinary action against a professional involved, or to obtain financial compensation. But beyond these personal motivations, patients also wanted to prevent the same from happening to someone else and improve the quality of care for the future. The review reveals that complaints can have both positive and negative effects on the system as a whole, and not just on individuals. At the patient level, the effects are usually positive and lead to financial compensation, an apology or explanation, or the possibility of changing professionals.Providers, on the other hand, often receive disciplinary action such as reprimands or fines. The effects are therefore punitive, which can therefore cause stress, anger and even depression among providers.At the level of the system as a whole, complaints can have a positive effect, and thus become a tool for learning and improvement. They make it possible to carry out investigations, identify problems and correct them. This requires analyzing not only complaints at the individual level, but also a collective analysis of all complaints in order to learn lessons. Not everyone may feel confident or able to make a complaint. Some people may be afraid to question the authority of providers, others may not know where to turn to, or feel helpless in the process. Remember:Don't be afraid to rattle the cage >>You have the right to be heard, listened to, respected and to receive clear information about your health and care. You have the right to appeal if your rights are violated.You are not alone >>Different individuals or groups can support you during the complaint process (whether it is your family, the users' or residents' committees of the establishments or an ombudsman);Find out about the processes in place >>Different processes may be in place to file a complaint. At the local level, it is very likely that the facility that provided you care has a mechanism for making a complaint. There are also complaint mechanisms at the provincial level, whether with professional colleges, with complaints commissioners at the Ministry of Health, or perhaps a provincial ombudsman (as is the case in Ontario with the Patient Ombudsman or the Quebec Ombudsman for health and social services).(4-5)If you are making a complaint on behalf of a patient, their consent may be required >>If you are a caregiver and you are making this complaint on behalf of someone else, the patient's (or their substitute decision-maker) may be necessary so that their personal information can be shared.""]"
85,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/10/01/3-evidence-based-tips-for-living-with-heart-failure,30 September 2020,3 evidence-based tips for living with heart failure,"['Wheezing, feeling tired and weak, trouble focusing, swelling, a fast or irregular heartbeat, being short of breath—during activity and/or rest—and sudden weight gain caused by the body holding fluid. These are just a few of the symptoms that people with heart failure commonly experience (1). If you have heart failure, you share this journey with the approximately 600,000 Canadians that currently live with this condition (2); and the additional 90,000 adults over 40 who are diagnosed annually (3). Although coming to grips with how to manage such a diagnosis can be daunting, as can coping with the impacts on your everyday life, there are things that you and your health care providers can do to improve certain aspects of your treatment plan and well-being (4; 6-10). Research on the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal outlines the following three tips for living with heart failure. Click on each title for more information. 1.Get physically active Heart failure is yet another health condition that calls for you to be physically active. What’s the benefit in this case? Well, engaging in exercise may significantly improve physical function and quality of life in people with chronic heart failure without any worsening of symptoms. These positive effects are seen when comparing those who exercise to those who do not exercise or those who receive usual care. Even better, it appears that details such as the type of exercise performed (specifically aerobic training, strength training, both, or exercise in therapy pools), how long it is done for, how often, at what intensity, and the location may not matter (4). This means that you and your health care provider have multiple options for identifying an exercise prescription that is safe and sustainable for you. 2.Enhance your self-care practices As the saying goes, some things are easier said than done. Self-care is one such thing. When it comes to self-care, some people with heart failure find it hard to implement recommended lifestyle changes—like the physical activity we just discussed (5). If you are struggling, a variety of methods exist to bolster your self-care efforts. These include: 1) working together with your health care provider to create a tailored self-care plan that takes into account your symptoms, needs, preferences, and capabilities; 2) using ‘decision aids’ to assist you in making tough choices; and 3) considering psychological strategies—such as cognitive behavioural therapy—that motivate and help you tackle the negative thoughts and conflicting feelings you may be experiencing (6;7). 3.Consider different transitional care options Hospitalization is a reality for some people with heart failure, as is being re-hospitalized shortly after coming home (8). This highlights the importance of transitional care that continues to meet people’s medical needs as they transition from the hospital to their homes (9;10). This type of care can be received remotely through telephone support or in-person via home visits by a health professional or by attending heart failure clinics. Evidence shows that home visiting programs and heart failure clinics can reduce the chances of being readmitted to the hospital and of death within six months after an initial hospitalization due to heart failure. If you are facing the challenge of transitioning from a hospital setting to your home, be sure to speak with your health care provider about the transitional care options available to you (11).']"
86,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/09/23/pandemics-and-panic-buying,23 September 2020,Pandemics and panic buying,"['We have all seen images on TV, the internet and in the newspapers of entire shelves in grocery stores and other retail stores emptied from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.(1) During natural disasters and health crises, people can develop unusual behaviors, such as panic buying. Panic buying is a phenomenon that occurs when consumers buy unusually larger quantities of certain products in anticipation of a disaster or crisis (real or perceived), or in anticipation of significant price changes.(2) Such a phenomenon can have undesirable effects. Panic buying can lead to an actual product shortage. It can limit or prevent the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and low-income individuals, from accessing certain products. Panic buying can also exacerbate fears and uncertainties about the disaster or crisis (real or perceived).(2) But why do people experience this shopping fever during crises? Psychological studies can help us understand this phenomenon. A systematic review of 27 articles looked at the psychological causes of panic buying during health crises, a relatively new and unexplored area in consumer behavior research.(3) The systematic review found that panic buying is influenced by four things: 1. Perception of the threat of the health crisis and the scarcity of products There are three types of behaviors that people adopt in response to a health crisis such as a pandemic: - prevention, such as hand washing, wearing a mask and cleaning surfaces;- avoidance, by reducing contacts with others in crowds, public transport and workplaces; and- clinical management of the disease, which involves seeking professional advice or taking medication. In the case of COVID-19, the more people perceive they are at risk of getting the disease, the more they will want to protect themselves. The more they want to protect themselves, the more they will buy basic necessities or medical supplies. On the other hand, if they also have the impression that products are scarce - or when they see empty shelves or queues in stores - they will be all the more motivated to buy them immediately. 2. Psychosocial factors Panic buying is a mass behavior (as also sometimes called ""herd behavior""). Misinformation and the spread of rumors (for example, rumors about a stockout and problems in the supply chain) can influence people to buy in large quantities. Lack of information can also cause them to imitate the majority who buy in panic. In addition, a high level of social mistrust towards the community or government authorities can lead some people to react and lead to panic buying. 3. Fear of the unknown In general, people experience emotional distress such as uncertainty, fear and anxiety during a health crisis. Very often, we find that fear motivates people to make purchases because it gives them a feeling of security, comfort, or momentary escape, which helps alleviate stress. 4. Coping behavior Although buying large quantities of consumer goods is ill-suited because it does not help or could even worsen product shortages, it gives individuals a sense of indirect control over the situation. As an individual, you can prepare yourself for different situations. The Government of Canada has prepared variousinformation toolsthat will allow you to prepare without giving in to panic. Government authorities, businesses and other civil society actors also have a role to play in alleviating panic buying during crises. They can thus:- send consistent messages on the availability of stocks to reduce the shortage of products perceived by consumers;- encourage online delivery and implement rapid restocking to avoid empty shelves and long queues;- apply sanctions and quotas for the purchase of essential products to prevent stock-outs and improve the public\'s perception of the shortage of products;- set the record straight quickly in the event of rumors and misinformation to reduce uncertainty and improve social confidence; and- highlight the negative consequences of panic buying and persuade the public to buy responsibly and reasonably. Whether a community can be resilient or collapse in the face of adversity may depend on how individuals, government authorities, businesses and other actors in civil society behave.']"

Can making a commitment help you achieve your diet and weight loss goals?,"[""“Commitment is the foundation of great accomplishments.”—Dr. Heidi Reeder, Author and Professor Be it losing weight, exercising more, or making better dietary choices; at one time or another, we’ve all had a health goal we’ve wanted achieve. However, those of us who’ve tried turning these hopes into a reality know that the road to success can be riddled with potholes and speed bumps. Take, for example, the goal of weight loss. For the almost two billion people globally who are considered to be either overweight or living with obesity (1), whether or not they're able to attain this goal can have positive or negative implications on their risk of death and developing other chronic conditions. Nevertheless, just knowing that there are benefits to losing excess weight and consequences to keeping it on isn’t always enough to get the job done (1;6). Have you, a friend, or a family member ever set a weight loss goal—perhaps as a New Year’s resolution or upon the recommendation of your health care provider? Take a second to reflect on this experience. Were you or they able to achieve it? If so, kudos! If not, ask yourself why? The answer to the last question may be complex and individual to you or your loved one. Still, many of us find it hard to achieve weight loss goals because we must often make fundamental changes to the way we live—specifically around how we eat and our exercise behaviours (2;7:8). A particular area of struggle, which can contribute to lack of success, seems to be insufficient adherence to strategies that target these lifestyle changes (2;9). So, the question then becomes, is there a technique that we can use to help us stick to strategies that drive lifestyle change? Arecentsystematic reviewlooking at commitment making aimed to find out (2). The review specifically investigated commitment making through the use of ‘soft commitment devices’ in adults who were overweight or living with obesity. These devices are essentially strategies—such as written pledges, behavioural contracts, or verbal agreements—that help you commit to attaining a chosen outcome or carrying out a desired behaviour, but without receiving incentives or rewards to do so. Within the review, written soft commitment devices—generally behavioural contracts—were combined with other lifestyle change supports such as educational weight loss programs. Ultimately, it was found that soft commitment devices may hold potential benefits for weight loss and diet changes, but not exercise. Increases in weight loss were seen both in the short-term (up to six months) and long-term (up to 12 months). In the short-term, those who used a soft commitment device lost an average of 1.52 kg more than those who received no treatment or information only. In the long-term, an average 1.7 kg more weight was lost. Short-term improvements to diet in the form of reducing calorie intake, increasing consumption from more healthy food groups, and reducing consumption from unhealthy food groups were also seen. What’s more, some evidence supports including a public component to this strategy, such as having a peer or health care provider witness the commitment being made. Ultimately, if your focus in on weight loss and improving your diet, commitment making through soft commitment devices may be helpful for you. Although the benefits highlighted by this review are encouraging, it should be noted that many of the results were based on a small number of studies. This means more high-quality research is needed to confirm these findings and gain a better understanding of the most effective characteristics of soft commitment devices (2). Looking to add an extra layer of accountability as you move through your weight loss journey? Speak with your health care provider about the benefits of commitment making and the best way to incorporate this technique into your weight loss plan.""]"

It is also a time of great uncertainty, as the consequences and course of the disease are not yet clearly defined.Grief and bereavement during a pandemic remain complex due to public-health measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus and protecting vulnerable people.(3) Physical distancing requirements mean that funerals are limited and those who have lost loved ones may have to grieve alone. The inability to say goodbye, the loss of social and community networks, living in confinement, and all the other social and economic impacts of the pandemic may exacerbate the grieving process.In recent months, people have voiced their concerns that the COVID-19 pandemic is depriving people of the possibility of grieving.(4) A Canadian coalition has also called for a national strategy to better support grief and bereavement which are currently ""distorted"" by the pandemic.(5)What strategies could help to deal with mass grief and bereavement? What programs and services could be put forward during a pandemic? A recent rapid review of 12 articles examined service delivered in the context of mass grief and bereavement following natural disasters or man-made disasters (for example, oil spills, transportation accidents, or terrorist attacks), but also following pandemics.(6) Although these events differ from the current pandemic, there have similar characteristics: the sudden and massive loss of human life, the lack of access to relatives after death and disruption to customary funeral rituals, job losses, social disruption, as well as intense media coverage of the events and their consequences.None of the studies reviewed provide strong evidence on the effectiveness of programs and services in supporting mass grief and bereavement. However, relevant measures in the context of COVID-19 have been identified:-a highly coordinated, proactive and multi-pronged approachto providing support to bereaved populations while avoiding promoting formal intervention with people who demonstrate resilience;-information and practical adviceprovided through multiple channels from the onset of the crisis, then moving to an open and centralized communication channel in the longer term;-an integrated local approachaimed both at raising awareness of support services and at communicating with people who are grieving (especially those living in rural and remote regions);-specific training for front-line workerson grieving and bereavement experiences, funeral rituals that must be changed and the effects of the intense media coverage during the pandemic;-psycho-educational approachesthat focus on understanding reactions to loss, normalizing grief, improving family and social relationships and promoting individual coping skills;-risk assessmentsthat take into account the impact of COVID-19 on other roles in life such as social isolation and unemployment to identify people likely to experience complicated grief and bereavement or to develop a mental health problem (or exacerbate pre-existing mental health problems); and-culturally sensitive approaches(that is, focused on the cultural needs of individuals, or that take into account the cultural and linguistic barriers of minority groups who are overrepresented in COVID-19 death rates).But until national strategies to support mass grief and bereavement are adopted, some programs and services exist to support you.Crisis Services Canadaprovides a list of crisis and counselling centers across the country (including local bereavement support groups).

Some common symptoms of menopause include issues with the genital system (e.g., vaginal dryness, soreness, itching, and burning), issues around sexual activity (e.g., painful intercourse), and issues of the lower urinary tract (e.g., urinary tract infections and urinary incontinence). More simply, these symptoms are referred to as ‘genitourinary syndrome’ (5). The vast majority of women experiencing menopause also ""feel the heat"" so to speak. How? Through mild to severe hot flashes and night sweats, also known as vasomotor symptoms (3;6-9). In addition to these unpleasant symptoms, menopause can bring with it a host of complications, such as the increased risk of bone loss and osteoporosis (10;11). What’s more, these challenges are not only confined to menopause, they can also persist into the post-menopausal period as well (9-13). Although the picture painted looks gloomy, there is indeed a bright side! And it’s that women don’t have to go it alone during this trying time. Here are some of the evidence-based strategies available to help women deal with the most commons symptoms and complications that accompany menopause. Click on the links below to learn more. 1.Genitourinary syndrome Vaginal estrogen, which can be applied directly to the vaginal area in the form of a tablet, cream, gel, or vaginal ring, is one treatment option for the symptoms of genitourinary syndrome. It’s typically recommended for individuals experiencing more than one symptom or whose symptoms are severe. Research shows that in comparison to no treatment orplacebo, vaginal estrogen can reduce symptoms of genitourinary syndrome—including vaginal dryness, painful intercourse, frequency of urinary tract infections, and urinary incontinence—in menopausal women. While currently the use of vaginal estrogen is deemed to be generally safe, more long-term research on safety is needed (14). 2.Hot flashes and night sweats In women going through natural menopause and with an intact uterus, research on treatment options suggests that hormone replacement patches that contain estrogen and progestogen, isoflavones, and black cohosh can reduce the frequency of hot flashes and night sweats, compared toplacebo. These strategies appear to be generally safe, with most women not experiencing serious side effects. With that said, anyone considering these treatment options should consult a health care professional to see if they are safe for them as an individual. It’s also important to consider that alternative therapies such as isoflavones and black cohosh can be prepared in a variety of ways, so the effectiveness and safety of each type of preparation my differ (7). 3.Bone loss When it comes to osteoporosis, risk factors are aplenty. Having undergone menopause and being in the post-menopausal stage is one such risk. But exercise is here to help yet again. Research suggests that exercise programs that combine multiple forms of exercise—generally resistance training and aerobic exercise—can enhance bone mineral density levels by a small amount in postmenopausal women, compared to usual levels of activity (11). Given that osteoporosis weakens bones, making them more vulnerable to breaks (10), this holds positive implications for bone loss and the potential to reduce fracture risk (11). Next steps Whether you’re well into your journey through menopause or are nearing the start of this next chapter of your life, be proactive and initiate or maintain dialogue with your health care provider on this topic. Inquire about the various stages of menopause and what they entail, be transparent regarding the symptoms you are experiencing or are concerned about for the future, seek information on available treatment options and strategies that reduce your risk of complications, and collaborate in the development of a plan that works best for you.']"
90,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/08/26/alternatives-to-the-car,26 August 2020,Alternatives to the car,"['It is widely believed that as people age, they stop driving and, as a result, switch to using public or adapted transport services. However, this is not what is observed. In Europe, almost 50% of trips by people aged 55 and over are made by car, either as a driver or passenger. This percentage reaches 70% in Australia and 80% in the United States.(1)Many older adults say that they have no other options for getting around… Yet there are a variety of alternative modes of transportation: public transit, flexible or adapted transportation, taxis, bicycles, walking.So, what is preventing them from adopting alternative modes of transport? A recent moderate-quality systematic review of 54 articles examined why public transport services (buses and trains), flexible or adapted transportation (which includes taxi-bus, community transport, and services for people with disabilities or reduced mobility), taxis, walking and cycling are often not seen by older adults as valid solutions to meet their mobility needs.(1)1. Infrastructures and the built environmentLanes, sidewalks and steps that are too narrow, broken or uneven, the lack of accessible toilets along the routes, as well as icy or snowy roads, sidewalks and trails are problems frequently raised by older adults. In addition, pedestrian lights often do not give them enough time to cross the road, and the distance between their destination and their residence can appear to be an insurmountable obstacle.2. Health statusSensory, cognitive and physical impairments due to aging are associated with a higher risk of falling. Lack of balance, difficulty getting on and off a bus, vision problems preventing them from perceiving fixed or moving objects, or the inability to quickly assess a potentially dangerous situation are all factors that can lead to fear of using alternative transport modes.3. SecurityThe lack of lighting in streets, paths and around public transit stops is an issue noted in the literature. In addition, certain behaviours of public transport drivers can sometimes affect the comfort and safety of\xa0 older users. This is particularly the case when drivers do not stop close enough to sidewalks to get users on and off (thus requiring them to perform stunts to get on or off a bus) or who do not wait for them to be seated before leaving (demanding that users transform into tightrope walkers before finding an available seat).4. Availability of servicesLack of flexibility in public transport routes and timetables, waiting times, the scarcity of taxis in some rural or remote areas, as well as the lack of or reduction in services outside of peak hours are barriers to use of alternative modes of transportation by older adults.5. CostsIf they are not offered reduced fares, older adults cannot always afford to get around by public or flexible transport or by taxi.6. ComfortThe lack of weatherproof bus shelters, space, seats, handrails or toilets affects the comfort of older adults who use public transport.7. Negative perceptionsNegative perceptions\xa0can have an influence on the choice of transport modes. For example, studies in rural Ireland have shown that community transport is recognized as a “female” mode of transport. Such prejudices thus seem to put off some older men. Other studies reveal negative perceptions of flexible transport services. These are often seen as a specialized service for disabled or disadvantaged people, and are therefore overlooked by many older adults.8. Access to informationFinally, lack of access to clear and timely information can also be a barrier. Ticket options, schedules, maps and directions are not always clearly indicated, and many older adults have difficulty finding stops.Of note, this systematic review was carried out before the global COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic will surely have an effect on perceptions of alternative modes of transportation and the risks of coronavirus transmission. While some alternative transportation may have gained in popularity since the pandemic (such as walking and cycling), it is possible that others (particularly public transportation) may have raised concerns among the general public. If alternatives to the car are not seen as viable options by older adults themselves, attempts to reduce their use of the car will most likely be unsuccessful. What solutions should be considered to meet their need for mobility?1- Involve older adults in identifying alternative transportation needs, obstacles and solutions.2- Inform and educate public transport staff about the needs of older users and how to meet them, but also older adults, directly in the places they frequent, such as churches, community or shopping centres, as well as health care establishments.3- Examine how technologies can help you meet your mobility needs. Public transit organizations have increasingly developed their own mobile apps that allow you to obtain detailed information in real time. Other ride-sharing apps can also give you more flexibility when travelling.']"

Add conditions or situations that make it harder or impossible to communicate our wants and needs—such as dementia or becoming critically ill (1;2)—and feeling empowered to speak up or having the ability to do so is further diminished or no longer an option. But we must remember that we are our own best advocate! Be it in managing chronic or progressive conditions or dealing with end-of-life care, proactively engaging in conversations, action plan development, and decision-making around our health is important. Luckily, there are various strategies—such as personalized care planning, advanced care planning, and person-centred care—that provide us with the opportunity to ensure our voice is heard (2-6). Here are a few of the research-based benefits to being involved in discussions and decisions about our health. Click on the links below to learn more. 1. Management of chronic conditions In Canada, 44% of adults aged 20 years old and over live with at least one of the top 10 chronic conditions—which include high blood pressure, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, and cancer (7). In fact, many folks over 50 live with multiple chronic conditions (8).Personalized care planningis a strategy centred on collaboration between patients and health care providers, and in some cases also caregivers. This type of teamwork involves discussions on how to treat and manage the person’s condition, goal setting, and the development of a tailored and actionable management plan to meet these goals. Research shows that this strategy can produce small improvements in health outcomes—such as blood sugar levels and blood pressure in people with diabetes, lung function in people with asthma, and depressive symptoms. It may also increase confidence in disease management (3). 2. Documenting and following through on end-of-life care wishes Conversations around one’s end-of-life care wishes can be difficult for the individual themselves, as well as their caregivers and health care providers.Caregivers have expressedthat often family members do not want to have these talks, while research has also shown that family members do not have the ability to predict the treatment preferences of their loved ones accurately (9). When it comes tohealth care providers, the evidence indicates that they face difficulties in identifying when older patients are in the last year of their life, do not adequately communicate the person’s prognosis to them during this time, and do not regularly involve them in decision-making about their end-of -life treatment (10). Together, these factors paint a picture for why advanced care planning is important. Advanced care planningis a way for patients to communicate and document end-of-life wishes and the treatment decisions they would like made in the event they are no longer able to make these decisions themselves. It generally involves communication between patients, health care providers, and caregivers/family members (6;11). Research shows that this form of planning can enhance awareness of advanced-care directives—such as living wills—and life-sustaining treatments. It can also increase documentation of the patient’s wishes and decisions through items such as powers of attorney and living wills, while also increasing the chances that these wishes are followed (6). For example, having an advanced care plan may lower the chances of unnecessary and stressful hospitalizations (6) or unwanted intensive care while in hospital (2). Need help in getting started with advanced care planning? Check out the ‘Speak Up’ website. 3. Empowering caregivers and improving their health outcomes The benefits of including people in conversations and decisions around their health extends beyond the individual to include their caregivers and family as well. Again,advanced care planningis a good example to refer to. In addition to the abovementioned benefits for the person receiving care, this type of planning may decrease depression, anxiety, and stress in families following the death of their loved one (6). We can also look to 'person-centred care'\xa0for people living with dementia. This form of care takes into consideration the abilities of the individual, as well as what they value, prefer, and need. In patients, it can help reduce agitation (12), while in caregivers, it may reduce stress and burnout (5). Making decisions that impact the health and quality of life of a loved one or even whether they live or die is not an easy task for caregivers. Luckily, it appears that person-centered care may be able to assist family members who make decisions on behalf of loved ones in increasing their confidence in the decisions they are making (4). Whether it is about a new or current disease management plan or preferences for your end of life care, do not count yourself out of conversations that concern your health and wishes. Speak up and make your values, needs, and wants known, while also seeking a collaborative relationship with caregivers and health care providers.""]"

(1) There are 288,800 wheelchair users, 70% of whom use manual chairs and 30% electric.(2 ) Mobility problems are common and can affect both autonomy and social participation. Among wheelchair users, their mobility is also hampered by various obstacles such as narrow or blocked sidewalks, surfaces that are difficult to navigate, the absence of ramps or ramps that are too steep, weather conditions that make the pavement snowy, muddy or slippery, or poor signalling. To get around the city safely and independently, wheelchair users are increasingly using route planners and navigation systems like Google Maps. Some technological advancements have been made in recent years, with some of these systems offering routes that take into account the mobility needs of wheelchair users. But conventional systems do not yet offer all the essential information such as the location of sidewalks, the slope, number and types of level crossings, while taking into account the individual profile of wheelchair users. The solution to make cities really accessible to people with reduced mobility? Developing geospatial assistive technologies that integrate a route planner and a navigation system taking into account the geographical position, the accessibility of places and the capabilities of the users and their types of wheelchairs. For example, a Canadian research group is currently carrying out a project (MobiliSIG) which aims to analyze accessibility information in an urban context and to disseminate this information in real time to the mobile devices of wheelchair users. But how do you know if these geospatial assistive technologies are user-friendly and meet the needs of wheelchair users? A systematic review examined 15 scientific articles to find out what criteria to consider when developing geospatial assistive technologies suitable for people who use wheelchairs.(2) This review came up with a list of 54 usability criteria that could be useful in refining existing geospatial assistive technologies. These criteria can also help health and social service professionals, as well as professionals responsible for urban planning and transport, to better meet the mobility needs of wheelchair users, help them plan their routes with the fewest obstacles possible and navigate in real time in an urban environment. Analysis of the 54 criteria identified in the review reveals key elements to take into account. First of all, we need to keep in mind that some users' hands will be occupied by the handrails of their wheelchair and that users will be looking in front of them (and around them), and not the screen of their devices. This means providing multimodal technologies that provide a screen as well as verbal instructions to guide them through their journey. The usability of these technologies should also take into account possible handling and weather issues (for example, wearing gloves in winter, rain, sunlight on the screen, traffic noise that may interfere with their use). Some of these technologies are intended to transmit information in real time which could help address some of these issues. Finally, we must take into account that some users may have limited working memory (that is, a limited ability to accumulate and temporarily manipulate information in order to perform a particular task). It is therefore necessary to make sure that the information on the screen is easily accessible to them (whether it is text, contrasted information, symbols, graphics, photos, or route views). Would you like help planning your wheelchair trips around town? Could geospatial assistive technologies help you? 1. Discuss your needs, preferences and concerns with a health professional (such as an occupational therapist working for a rehabilitation program). 2. Examine existing technologies to determine if they can meet your needs, preferences and concerns. 3. Take a moment to make sure these technologies are user-friendly: how the information is presented (clarity, colour, graphics, consistency, credibility, readability, relevance, reliability, comprehension), how easy it is to navigate, if the vocabulary used accessible, how easy the interface is to control by voice or touch, or if there is a voice recognition system. 4. Ask your health professional if there are decision support tools available to help you make decisions about geospatial assistive technologies, as well as resources that can help you and your loved one to navigate through the publicly funded programs and charities to obtain such technologies.""]"

Exercising at home may remove a few of the barriers that people face, paving the way to better health outcomes. Parkinson’s is a life-long, debilitating disease that affects the nervous system (1;2), leading to problems with balance, movement, and posture, as well as symptoms such as shaking (tremors) and muscle stiffness. These issues can increase a person’s risk of falling and tend to get worse over time (3;4). Currently, Parkinson’s affects over six million people worldwide. With this number expected to double over the next 20 years, Parkinson’s sits atop the list of the most rapidly rising neurological disorders (1;2). Although there is no cure for Parkinson’s, physiotherapy, which includes a variety of exercises, has proven to be a useful management strategy (1;5). But for those with chronic illnesses, mobility issues, or limited access to health services, regular exercise can be difficult, particularly when it requires leaving home to exercise at a community or medical centre or facility. This is where exercise carried out at home can be extremely valuable, particularly because it can require minimal equipment and resources, and can be continued over a long period of time (1). This brings us to two interesting questions. First, what are the benefits of home-based exercise in people with Parkinson’s? And second, how does exercising at home stack up against centre-based exercise? A recentsystematic reviewlooked at whether home-based exercise—prescribed by a physiotherapist or other health care provider—improves balance-related activities and quality of life in adults with mild to severe Parkinson’s disease, but without cognitive impairment. Home-based exercise (when almost 70% of exercise was done at home) was compared to usual care and centre-based exercise (completed at a medical centre, community centre, private clinic, etc.). Exercises included balance, walking, range of motion, and strength activities. The review found that home-based exercise programs can improve walking speed and the ability to perform balance-related activities by a small amount immediately after the end of the program. However, these improvements appear relatively short-lived, making the case that exercise may need to be continued to see lasting benefits. Home-based exercise can also improve quality of life by a small amount. Interestingly, this benefit was not seen right away, but instead appeared at six to 46 weeks after the exercise program was completed. What’s more, a few small studies within the review demonstrated that comparable home vs. centre-based exercise programs produced similar effects on balance and quality of life immediately after program completion (1). If you or a loved one have Parkinson’s disease, consider speaking to a physiotherapist or health care provider about whether home-based exercise programs are a good fit for you. They can work with you to create an exercise plan that’s easily accessible, tailored, affordable, and most importantly safe.']"

To reduce limitations or improve physical and cognitive functions, it is possible to use what are called ""assistive technologies"". For example, walkers, canes, motorized scooters, hearing aids, and wheelchairs allow people with disabilities to stay active and mobile in the community. Likewise, smartphones and tablets can be used to support people with dementia, providing them with reminders, storing information and keeping track of events. As the older adult population continues to grow, assistive technologies can play an important role in promoting healthy aging and independent living. Of those living with a disability in Canada, 81% report using some sort of assistive technology (for example, hearing aids, magnifiers, wheelchairs, and hand and arm supports), and 30% of those aged from 45 to 74 report experiencing unmet need for assistive technologies, which increases to 44% among those reporting severe disability.(2; 3)Despite the potential benefits and unmet needs for assistive technologies, some older adults remain reluctant to use them. Some even say that ""it is not for me, I am not there yet"" ... What can explain this reluctance? A systematic review of 49 articles examined how the desire to maintain an identity compatible with competence, independence and autonomy influences the decision-making processes of older people about assistive technology adoption.(4) Despite the great diversity of populations and technologies studied, the importance of self-image in decision-making was evident. This review revealed five themes: 1. Resistance to stereotypes related to aging or disability The fear of being stigmatized or discriminated strongly influences older adults not to adopt certain assistive technologies. Robots, alarms and mobility devices are seen as a visible sign of aging in a society that too often equates aging with disability. Additionally, some older adults fear that they may be the only person using assistive technology in public spaces. However, if others around them use similar technologies, their self-image seems to be improved. Conversely, some older people feel compelled to adopt modern technologies to avoid being labeled as old or outdated. 2. Independence and sense of control Maintaining independence and autonomy is essential for healthy aging, and older adults do not want to be seen as a burden. This is why technologies which extend autonomy in daily activities can be seen in a positive light. Older adults want to be in control of their lives and prefer to use technologies they can control. For others, on the contrary, the use of assistive technologies confirms their loss of independence and they reject this negative image and the technologies associated with it. Some also fear becoming dependant on assistive technologies. 3. Aesthetics Until recently, the design of many technologies for older adults was largely dictated by function, regardless of aesthetics (which refers to appearance, feel and size). However, older people prefer low-profile technology to avoid possible embarrassment and stigma that may be associated with it. 4. Technologies of last resort Many older adults only consider assistive technology as a last resort, if they become disabled, ill, lonely or demented, or if their doctor advises them to use one. And again, they can still question this recommendation if it is perceived as incompatible with their perception of their own capacities. Often, older adults would rather stay at home and forgo participating in social and community activities they hold dear rather than using technology that puts their disability first. 5. Privacy While some older adults are willing to accept technological inclusion into their lives in exchange for greater security, independence and autonomy, many fear that someone may be spying on them and their data may be stolen or used against them. Findings from this research can shed light on how to approach conversations and decisions about the use of assistive technology. If you are a caregiver would like to engage in a conversation with their loved one about assistive technologies, remember the following: 1. Be sure to discuss with them about their needs, preferences and concerns; 2. Highlight how these technologies can meet their needs (increase their independence and autonomy, increase their mobility and social interactions, help them age at home as long as possible or improve their quality of life); 3. Examine whether certain technologies can better respond to their needs and concerns, whether in connection with the aesthetics of the technology or fears relating to their privacy; and 4. Ask their healthcare professional if decision aids are available to help make decisions about assistive technologies, but also resources that can help you and your loved one navigate publicly-funded programs and charities to obtain assistive technologies.']"

Defined as a blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg (1-3), it affects nearly one in four Canadian adults (1;4) and is the leading preventable risk factor for heart disease (1;2;5;6). If left untreated, it increases the risk of serious conditions like heart attack, stroke, heart failure, kidney damage, and vision loss (2;6-8). Most people recognize it’s important to keep their blood pressure within a healthy range. Unfortunately, some folks may not know they have high blood pressure, or struggle to access services for treatment. This is because blood pressure screening often occurs at routine visits with a primary health care provider, which excludes people who do not, or cannot, regularly visit such providers (3). Even those who know their blood pressure is high may struggle to take their medication as prescribed or may not participate in the follow-up care that allows their health care provider to develop effective individualized treatment plans (2;9-11). How can these barriers to effective blood pressure management be overcome? Twosystematic reviewsexplored whethercommunity-based screeningnot done by a physician (blood pressure screening that occurs outside of a traditional healthcare setting, such as at a pharmacy or mobile health unit) (3) andself-monitoring(when a person checks their own blood pressure) (9) are potential solutions. When it comes to detecting high blood pressure, community-based screening can be a successful approach. This type of screening can also include a referral to healthcare services, which may lead to a new diagnosis of high blood pressure or new treatment in some cases. It is, however, not yet clear which types of community-based screening are most effective, and there is a need for further research in this area (3). For those who face barriers to accessing routine primary healthcare services, community-based screening could be a helpful first step in helping to identify high blood pressure. When it comes to managing high blood pressure, self-monitoring may help people take their medication as prescribed, thereby aiding in lowering blood pressure. Even better, when blood pressure measurements are forwarded to a physician, physicians may be able to adjust treatment plans to individual patients’ needs to achieve better blood pressure management. Self-monitoring, however, does not appear to improve lifestyle habits such as diet and exercise. With that said, more research is needed to establish the most effective self-monitoring practices and strategies for lowering blood pressure (9). The bottom line…know your numbers! Community-based screening and self-monitoring can be important approaches to overcoming the barriers to effective blood pressure diagnosis and management, providing an avenue towards better health outcomes for people with high blood pressure.']"

Just think of measures of physical distancing, measures of isolation and confinement in certain establishments (including hospitals and long-term care and accommodation centers), measures of taking care of bodies and services funeral, or measures related to the ban on gatherings.(3) Although these measures are important to slow the spread of COVID-19, they have resulted in many families losing loved ones without being able to accompany them in their last moments, or to honor their memory at public events. There is no doubt that this can contribute to the grief and distress of the bereaved. What can we learn from past pandemics and infectious disease outbreaks about the care or supports required to allow people to grieve when strict public-health measures are in place? A recent systematic review identified six studies examining the impact of infectious disease outbreaks on grief and bereavement in West Africa (Ebola), Haiti (cholera) and Singapore (SARS).(4) This review reveals that few studies have been done on this subject. In addition, the majority of these studies came from low and middle-income countries (except Singapore) and from countries with different cultural and spiritual belief systems than those prevalent in Western societies. However, several elements may apply to the current COVID-19 pandemic. Also, although the studies did not specifically focus on those who are bereaved and focused on those who have had the disease and have recovered, it is recognized that survivors of cholera, Ebola or SARS pandemics have been confronted on the death of several of their relatives. Studies have thus identified three common themes related to death, grief and bereavement in a pandemic. 1. A loss experienced at different levels: in addition to the loss of family members and the fact of witnessing the death of other people, individuals also experience a symbolic loss of lifestyle, culture and social practices during pandemics. The mode of transmission of infectious diseases usually require containment and physical distancing measures which go against the desire to offer close, compassionate care to patients and their families at the end of life. 2. A great uncertainty:the rapid and uncertain evolution of certain illnesses does not adequately prepare families for the imminent death of their loved one. In addition, the information provided by authorities and the interpretation made by individuals based on their perceptions and beliefs can help to nurture this uncertainty and delay the psychological preparation for death. This uncertainty can create fear among patients, caregivers and professionals, and lead to increased psychological distress and sometimes even angry reactions towards individuals and institutions. 3. A limited capacity for social support:the ability of individuals to support themselves during illness, grief and bereavement is limited during pandemics, whether between patients, families, caregivers or professionals. For example, the requirement to wear personal protective equipment and the isolation of infected patients limits physical contact and restricts visits by family members. In addition, the implementation of physical distancing measures and the prohibition of public gatherings prevent family members and friends from coming together to collectively grieve. If you have experienced the loss a loved one during the pandemic, there are a few steps you can take to help you grieve: Stay connected.Invite people to call you or set up conference calls or virtual conferences with family and friends to stay in touch. Share stories and photos by post, email, phone, video chat or through apps or social media.(5) Reinvent mourning rituals and practices.We need mourning rituals and practices that arerespectful, consistent with the faith or culture of families, to mark the departure of the loved one during pandemics. Why not create a virtual memory book, blog or web page so that family and friends can honour the memory of your loved one, share memories. Prepare your loved one's favorite meal or any other concrete gesture that had significance and can remind you of them.(5) Ask for help.Getting help is essential if you or a loved one is going through a crisis or needs emotional support.(5)Crisis Services Canadaprovides a list of crisis and listening centers across the country (including local grief and bereavement support groups). These centers are there to respond to people who ask for help.""]"

The benefits of eating a healthy and well-balanced diet for physical wellness are widely recognized (1-9). Sticking to a healthy diet, however, can be challenging even under the most normal of circumstances. Add an unexpected pandemic into the mix and this goal may seem even farther away! Think about it like this: when we’re happy, we often gather around food to celebrate; when we’re sad or worried, we sometimes turn to food for comfort; and when we’re bored, eating or cooking can give us something to do to pass the time. These are just a few examples to highlight how our eating behaviours can be influenced by our emotions. Given that boredom, feelings of sadness, worry, and stress are trademarks in times of crisis, like the current global pandemic (10), it should come as no surprise that along with mental well-being, diet may also be impacted. That brings us to the big question…should folks be paying attention to their diet in this already difficult time? We can look toa recentsystematic review, which delved deeper into whether improving diet can impact mental well-being, for insight (11). The review examined a variety of different dietary strategies that focused on cutting down on fat intake and increasing healthy nutrients, for example. The studies within the review mostly included people who reported a low mood but didn’t have a diagnosis of depression or anxiety. Overall, it appears that dietary strategies may result in small improvements in mental well-being, and in particular, mood. However, no effect is seen on anxiety. Although the findings are an encouraging first step, there were large differences between the studies included within the review. As a result, more research is needed to establish which dietary components and features are best for enhancing mental well-being, and to inform the development of effective strategies (11). Given the established physical health benefits (1-9) and emerging evidence around mental well-being (11), it doesn’t hurt to reflect on your diet and perhaps how it has changed over the past several months in response to the pandemic. Remember to not be too hard on yourself, these are trying times and it’s never too late to start focusing on your well-being. This self-reflection exercise may increase your awareness of areas where adjustments can be made or where support can be sought. Reaching out to a health professional, such as a registered dietitian, is always a good place to start. Together you can collaborate on an individualized plan that works best for you. Don’t know how to connect with a dietitian? Here are some tips: Reach out to your primary health care provider for help with a referral. Visit theDietitians of Canada websitefor a list of helpful resources. Do some research into services offered by grocery store chains or pharmacies in your area. Some are now providing dietitian services online or by phone.']"

Carbon dioxide (CO2) levels and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere rose to new records.(1; 2) Weather patterns are changing, sea levels are rising, and extreme weather events are becoming more common (such as droughts, fires and floods).Climate change is affecting everyone on the planet, but research evidence shows that it is disproportionately affecting older adults.(3; 4) Many older adults live in urban and densely populated areas and are likely to be increasingly affected by climate stressors, such as hurricanes, droughts, floods, infectious disease, air pollution, and rising summer temperatures. They may also have chronic health conditions (diabetes, respiratory problems, cardiovascular diseases), as well as other social conditions (social isolation, limited income and poor housing) that put them at greater risk.(3; 4)For some, climate change seems inevitable. But recent events have shown that it may be possible to change the course of climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic has been marked by a massive loss of human lives, as well as personal tragedies due to the social and economic impact of COVID-19. However, the pandemic has enabled us to observe a dramatic change in greenhouse gas emissions, which are expected to drop about 6% in 2020 due to travel bans and economic slowdowns.(5) This significant improvement may only be temporary if we go back to our normal ways, but local, national and international leaders are advocating for changes.(6)As countries move toward rebuilding their economies after COVID-19, their recovery plans can shape a new path towards greener, healthier and stronger economies. The head of the United Nations Environment Programme, Inger Andersen, indicated that the current COVID-19 crisis is an opportunity for “a profound,\xa0systemic shift to a more sustainable economy\xa0that works for both people and the planet.”(7) Thus, national economic plans could help us recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, while at the same time posing positive climate actions. Older adults are “an untapped, renewable resource on climate\xa0action”.(8) Many are calling to tap into the ‘gray power’ to support intergenerational climate action.(8) Indeed, older adults can play several meaningful roles:Advocating for positive climate actions in the recovery plans(for example, using taxpayers’ money to create green jobs and inclusive growth when rescuing businesses and otheractions proposed by the United Nations); Raising awareness about climate change as a pressing global issue; and Encouraging individuals to take simple actions(the United Nations’ActNowcampaign lists 10 actions from taking shorter showers to buying local produce).

Around the world, over 420 million people live with diabetes, and this number is gradually rising. Type 2 diabetes in particular accounts for the vast majority of diabetes cases (2). Type 2 diabetes is a chronic illness, meaning that folks who live with this diagnosis may face a long-term battle coping with a number of potential symptoms and side effects. However, type 2 diabetes can be successfully managed, and finding new and effective ways to do so is likely a top priority for this who live with this disease day in day out. Do you or someone you know have type 2 diabetes? Click on the links below to learn more about some of the different strategies that can help in managing the disease and avoiding related complications. 1. Make exercise a part of your routine Exercising on a regular basis is important for both theprevention and managementof type 2 diabetes. On the management end, aerobic exercise can lower blood sugar levels and enhance fitness, especially when performed over longer periods of time or at higher intensities (3). For those looking to start with a slower paced activity, or to spice up their current routine,yogaand exercises based in traditional Chinese medicine—such astai chi and ba duan jin—may be worth a try (4;5). Research indicates that yoga may improve blood sugar control, and decrease blood pressure,body mass index(BMI), and cholesterol (4). Similarly, the potential individual benefits of tai chi and ba duan jin on factors such as blood sugar, BMI, quality of life, and symptoms of depression have also been shown. Building up to 150 minutes per week (or half an hour five times a week) of exercise is particularly effective (5). 2. Try a diabetes self-management program Diabetes self-management programscan help older adults with type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels, blood pressure, and cholesterol by a small amount. But not all programs measure up. The most effective programs are individualized programs that match the needs and goals of the person, and those that include a focus on mental health (6). 3. Pay attention to your foot health Individuals with diabetes face challenges aroundmaintaining the healthof their feet. This is often the result of nerve damage that can occur due to diabetes. To prevent foot disease, knowing the signs that indicate that something is wrong is important. Keep note of any times where you lose feeling in the feet or experience tingling and numbness. Second, daily foot care is a must, including monitoring (checking for wounds, cracks, blisters, dryness, and toenail changes), cleaning, and moisturizing. The good news is it can also be done at home. Other tips include wearing shoes, not being barefoot, and regularly having your feet assessed by a professional (7;11). 4. “Plug into” the tech Dear gadget lovers you are in luck! Technology can play a role in improving diabetes outcomes. Take for examplewearable technology—such as pedometers or fitness trackers. Research shows that these devices can help users to improve blood sugar levels, certain aspects of blood pressure, and BMI by a small amount when added to one-on-one counselling with goal setting focused on increasing physical activity (12). Smartphones are another modern day gizmo to consider adding to your self-management toolkit. Why? Well,mobile phoneappsmay help folks achieve better control of their blood sugar levels, while potentially providing remote access to feedback from their health care provider (13;14). 5. Learn from your peers It is often said that people are experts in their own experience. If this is true, than in addition to understanding and support, those who live with type 2 diabetes have a wealth of knowledge they can share with others coping with the same life-long challenge. Indeed,evidence showsthat peer support may help individuals to lower blood sugar levels, especially when received frequently and in a one-on-one format (15). From exercise to foot health to peer support, a variety of strategies and techniques are available to assist those living with type 2 diabetes in better controlling their blood sugar levels, as well as managing other aspects of their health and well-being.']"

They can be about treatment and care options, finances, legal issues, driving, housing among others.Some of these decisions can be particularly complex. For example, a recent systematic review identified 88 factors influencing housing decisions among frail older adults.(1) That means that choosing to stay at home or move to a senior’s residence (or somewhere else) can be influence by 88 factors. Another example is the process of being discharged from hospital to home (which is quite common for older adults). A recent study revealed that there are 52 moments when a choice must be made during the hospital-to-home transition period.(2-3)We often take for granted that we will have a say in decisions affecting us. However, a large proportion of older adults and caregivers are not formally engaged in discussions about their own health and well-being. In a 2018 survey of 1,591 Canadians (of whom 939 had received health services in the previous year), only 36% of older adults said they were often presented with choices, and only 35% were often asked what mattered to them.(4)How can we support older adults, their families and their caregivers to be engaged when it comes to matters that affect their health and wellbeing? Shared decision-making is a collaborative process whereby health and social care providers support individuals in making decisions informed by the best available evidence and what matters most to them.(5) Research evidence shows that shared decision-making leads to better care experiences and health outcomes for patients, as well as improving the use of healthcare resources.(6-9)Many tools and services can support older adults, families and caregivers. For example,decision coachesare trained professionals who provide support to develop patients' skills in thinking about the options, preparing for discussing the issue in a consultation with their providers and implementing the chosen option.But perhaps the most commonly used tools are the decision aids. These are tools that help patients, families and caregivers become involved in decision making around difficult issues. They provide information about the options and outcomes (based on the best available research evidence), and by clarifying personal values to help people navigate between the different options.Systematic reviews found that decision aids can:- help patients to be better informed with more realistic expectations;(10)- clarify their values in order to make a choice;(10)- reduce the overuse of unnecessary and ineffective treatment and care options;(10)- increase the uptake of effective treatment and care options;(10) and- reduce harms and increase patient safety.(6) Being engaged in decisions that affect our lives is not a privilege, it is a fundamental right. Think about the following steps: 1. Identify the decision to be made (in collaboration with your family, caregivers, and providers); 2. Find the right tools and support to take an informed decision that is aligned with your goals, your values, your preferences and the best research evidence available. Your providers may be able to offer you relevant tools and support such as:- decision coach;- a conversation guide (that you can use to ask questions to your providers); or- a decision aid (if not, you can check the repository of decision aids by theMcMaster Optimal Aging Portalin partnership with theOttawa Hospital Research Institute, or theDecision Boxhosted by Université Laval) 3. Have another conversation with your family, caregivers and providers to make sure that your goals, values and preferences are incorporated into the decision.""]"

People living with overweight or obesity may also find it more challenging to complete necessary or desired everyday activities (4). These impacts highlight the importance of achieving and/or maintaining a healthy weight. However, making this goal a reality is no easy feat. Click the links below for some tips that that can help you find success. 1. Consider changes to diet and exercise, using strategies that provide encouragement, and self-monitoring When it comes to losing weight,research paints the picturethat in adults who are classified as overweight, making changes to your diet alone is more beneficial than making changes to your exercise routine alone. But the best strategy is one that combines both diet and exercise (5). In terms of dietary patterns,there is some evidencethat those who follow vegetarian diets can lose more weight than those who do not (6). When it comes to maintaining weight,it appears several strategies may assistin holding off weight gain in adults, although no specific strategies can be suggested over others. Overall, diet changes such as following a low-fat diet or eating more fruits and vegetables, along with monitoring your heart rate while exercising and receiving reinforcement through text messages or group support may be beneficial (7). 2. “Live in the moment” with mindfulness training Mindfulness training is a technique that emphasizes being aware of what you are thinking, feeling, and sensing, and of what is around you (8).Encouraging evidence showsthat engaging in mindfulness activities can reduce impulsive eating and binge eating in adults with overweight or obesity. It can also help folks trying to increase their physical activity (9). If you are looking to “dip your toes” into mindfulness, a number of internet-based programs are available (10). 3. Seek support through lifestyle counselling programs Sticking to changes you have made to your diet and exercise routine can be hard. The good news is you don’t have to go it alone.Research on behavioural lifestyle counselling programs, which often provide participants with in-depth guidance and support, reveals that behaviours around diet and exercise can be improved. What’s more, in adults who have at least one risk factor for cardiovascular disease, positive effects can be seen on a variety of health outcomes, including body weight, blood sugar levels, cholesterol, blood pressure, and diabetes (11;12). The importance of an interactive component within lifestyle programs is highlighted throughadditional research. This research found that online weight loss programs that provide personalized feedback can help overweight and obese adults lose more weight in the short-term than programs that do not offer this type of feedback (13). If you are considering making changes to your diet or exercise routines, speak with your health care provider before you start. They will help you assess whether these changes are right for you or how to best go about applying them. It is no secret that the road to achieving or maintaining a healthy weight can sometimes be a bumpy one, and that is okay. This is a long-term journey. Luckily, from diet and exercise to mindfulness training, there are several strategies that show promise in helping you attain results and overcome hurdles along the way.']"

Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen surges of solidarity at the local and community level, people trying to break the wall of isolation using virtual means, as well as collective efforts aimed at respecting the complex and restrictive public health measures.But pandemics, like the one we are experiencing, are also fertile ground for social stigma.(1) When it comes to health, social stigma refers to the negative association between a group of people who share certain characteristics and a specific disease. This means that people are labelled, stereotyped, discriminated against, and treated unfairly because of a perceived connection to the disease.(2)The current COVID-19 pandemic has caused such stigma towards various groups, including people of Asian descent (several individuals and public figures tried to blame them for the COVID-19 pandemic); people in close contact with the virus (such as healthcare workers in long-term care facilities that have been severely affected by the pandemic); but also older adults.(1; 2; 3)The World Health Organization and many researchers have expressed concerns about a strong trend towards stigmatization of older adults and intergenerational divisions since the beginning of the pandemic. Whether in the press, social media and public discourses, older adults are often portrayed as vulnerable, frail, helpless and unable to contribute to society.(2; 3; 4) Several factors may have contributed to fueling social stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is a new disease for which there are still many unknowns. People are often afraid of the unknown and it is easy to associate such fear with “the others.”(2) More factors could also fuel the stigmatization of older adults, notably ageism already common in our societies, the use of arbitrary age cut-offs by public health authorities (for example, recommending that all people aged 70 and over stay confined) (3), and the fact that several outbreaks took place in long-term care facilities. In addition, government responses to the pandemic have greatly affected the lives of many people (from school and business closures, to massive job losses). This may have fueled intergenerational divides and prompted many to question certain public health measures affecting the entire population (rather than strictly targeting older adults). Social stigma can have dire consequences, especially during pandemics. It can undermine social cohesion and cause possible isolation of certain groups. This can lead to more serious health problems and difficulty in controlling pandemics. It can lead people to hide that they are infected with the virus to avoid being discriminated against, prevent them from seeking care when in need, or discourage them from adopting healthy behaviours.(2; 3) You can do your part to fight social stigma during the COVID-19 pandemic. -Be aware of the weight of words: Avoid using terms that fuel stereotypes and that suggest that older adults are all fragile and vulnerable.(2) -Spread the facts: Misinformation about how the virus is transmitted and treated, or about the effectiveness of public health measures, can reinforce social stigma. Make sure to share trustworthy and evidence-informed information with your friends and family.(2; 4) -Remind people about the importance of social cohesion: A lack of social cohesion can seriously undermine the effectiveness of public health\xa0measures to respond to the pandemic. Our ability to weather these hard economic and social times depends on our capacity to stick together.(2; 4) -Encourage intergenerational solidarity: Share stories that humanize the experiences and struggles of people of all ages affected by the pandemic, and emphasize the need to support one another.(1; 2; 4)Together, we can fight the pandemic and become stronger, united communities.']"

In fact, stress, sadness, and fear are “par for the course” in times of crisis (1), so finding ways to inject laughter and humour into our days to help us maintain perspective can seem challenging. But it’s worth a try, after all they do say that “laughter is the best medicine…” Onerecentsystematic reviewshed a little bit of light on some strategies we can use to incorporate laughter and humour. These strategies are aptly titled “laughter and humour interventions” (2). One common example of a laughter intervention is laughter yoga, a combination of yoga breathing and laughing exercises (2;3). Humour interventions involve purposely using a humorous activity—such as watching a funny movie or telling jokes—to help people identify, communicate, and value the at times inconsistent or seemingly ridiculous aspects of life in a fun way (2;4;5). What makes these strategies even more relevant at the moment is that some can be done at home. This can be as easy as popping on a funny movie, registering for an online laughter yoga program, or following along with online videos. Although there are versions of these strategies that require payment, others can be free. So, should you invest time and potential resources into “tickling your funny bone? The review looked at adults engaging in laughter interventions such as laughter yoga and laughter exercises—either alone or in combination with other activities—or humour interventions such as skills training or watching a funny movie. These folks were generally compared to those maintaining their regular lifestyle. Overall, some evidence shows that laughter and humour interventions may help to reduce feelings of sadness and worry in adults. However, the size of the impact is only small to moderate. Another check-mark on the side of laughter interventions is that they may give a small boost to sleep quality, although this positive finding is only based on a couple of studies included in the review. The authors of the review also note that, so far, there appears to be no negative side effects from trying out these strategies. With that said, it’s important to keep in mind that more research with a greater number of participants and different populations and study designs is needed to confirm any positive effects. Where does that leave us? Well, given that these strategies are seemingly safe and have the potential to be accessible, they may be worth a try. So, consider popping on a funny movie and settling in for a night of laughter, or check-outing a guided laughter yoga session online. If you’re really brave, plan a virtual stand-up comedy night with your friends/family and actively participate in some joke telling. These are just a few of the many ways we can inject some humour and laughter into our lives during these difficult times. Please note that these strategies should never replace treatments prescribed to you by a health care professional. If you are looking for more tips on self-care during this pandemicorare experiencing high-levels of mental distress, please refer to theGovernment of Canadawebsite for information on strategies you can implement or resources you can access for support.']"

Summer is upon us and you are likely eager to stretch out after weeks of confinement due to the COVID-19 pandemic (while respectingpreventive measuressuch as physical distancing). If you live in the city, many urban green spaces, such as parks and trails are available to enjoy in your neighbourhood. With the aging population and knowing that on a global scale, approximately two out of three persons will live in an urban environment by 2050,(1) more and more social and physical infrastructure are designed to meet the needs of different urban populations, including older adults. But what do we know about the capacity of urban green spaces to improve health and well-being of older adults? A recent systematic review of moderate quality examined 38 studies on the effects of various interventions aimed at creating, maintaining and preserving urban green spaces.(2) These interventions concerned parks, the development and improvement of urban greenways or walking and cycling trails, urban 'greening' and large ecological construction projects for environmental purposes such as green roofs and rain gardens (to manage rain water runoffs). Although studies have been mainly conducted in high-income countries, such as the United States, Australia and the United Kingdom, the results are promising: better physical health, improved well-being, lower levels of stress, reduction in crime and increased perception of security, but also greater biodiversity. The evidence is also strong on the importance of turning vacant lots or urban streets in more environmentally friendly spaces: improved well-being, greater biodiversity, but also an increased sense of security and less vandalism. The development of rain gardens and green roofs, as well as the planting of trees also allow better control of rainwater, and help to address ‘heat islands’ that are created in urban areas and that can be overwhelming for older adults. Research has also shown that to obtain tangible results, it is not enough to physically adapt those green spaces. They must also be promoted to encourage their use by older adults. Any initiative is not without consequences, however. It is essential to consult different populations (including older adults) and experts in different fields (urban planning, landscaping, ecology, engineering, health, economics, etc.) to minimize certain undesirable effects. For example, adding lighting in parks increases the feeling of security and promotes more frequentation of the park, but may keep birds away and reduce biodiversity due to light pollution. In the coming days and weeks, as you begin to explore more of the urban green spaces in your area, take note of the possible improvements in order to share your observations and recommendations with your elected municipal officials or the managers of these spaces. Here are a few known measures that can improve urban green spaces that will encourage people to use them more frequently: - design urban green spaces so that it is safe, accessible and without obstacles - create walking paths with non-slippery materials and minimize slopes - install road signs and maps in the paths to allow people to orient themselves and measure the distance travelled - set up visible signage to indicate the name and entrances to the park - encourage gardening by setting up a community garden (and set up a clear protocol aimed at ensuring the health and safety of users in times of pandemic) - keep the premises clean and promote a sense of security by collecting garbage daily, installing more lighting, emergency telephones and security cameras - promote urban green spaces in neighbouring residencesYour ideas matter. Together we can improve the green spaces in our communities.""]"

Upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) such as the common cold, which affect the pharynx (throat), larynx (voice box), sinuses, or nose, are certainly no exception (4–5). To treat or prevent URTIs many people are flocking to echinacea, a group of North American wildflowers belonging to the daisy family (4;6-9). Three species in particular—E. angustifolia, E. purpurea, and E. pallida—are used for medicinal purposes. Echinacea products vary in the combination of species they contain (4), the part of the plant they use (i.e., the entire plant, versus the root, flower, stem, or leaves), how the medicinal compounds are extracted, and whether other natural components are included (10). They also come in many forms, such as capsules and tablets, juices, teas, extracts, drops, and powders (4). Just how many people are on the echinacea bandwagon? With annual sales in the U.S. ranging from $10–100 million, it’s safe to say…“a lot.” Given this dedicated fan base, you may be surprised to learn that echinacea’s safety and effectiveness are still up for debate (4;11–16). Onerecentsystematic reviewweighed in on the discussion, specifically looking at whether echinacea can prevent or treat URTIs (4). The review compared people using echinacea in a variety of doses and forms (e.g., capsules, juices, and more) to people using aplacebosuch as vegetable oil, beeswax, herb powder, or chocolate-flavoured syrup. The review found that echinacea had a small effect, reducing the chances of developing a URTI by 12%–22%. In contrast, echinacea had no effect on how long a URTI lasted once an infection had taken hold. It’s worth noting that the studies included in the review were not always of high quality, and there were large differences in how they were conducted. This makes it difficult to pinpoint the type of echinacea products to recommend and how much to take. Variation in how echinacea products are prepared and how people use them could also affect how well echinacea works in the real world, outside of a research setting. Fortunately, short-term use of echinacea doesn’t appear to come with an increased risk of negative side effects, but more research is needed into how safe these products are if used long-term (4). So, does echinacea deserve a spot in your medicine cabinet? Ultimately, folks should keep in mind that it’s important to weigh echinacea’s limited benefits against the uncertainty around its long-term safety. As with any other supplement, in addition to doing your own research, make sure to consult with your health care provider to understand how echinacea might interact with any existing health conditions or other medications and supplements you are taking, as well as any other potential risks with its use.']"

Whether it is a vulnerability to illness, or a vulnerability to the health, social and economic consequences of the illness.(1; 2) Think of our frail older adults who often have complex health and social care needs, and who are often dependent on paid and unpaid caregivers.The pandemic also reveals how shaken the whole community can be in such circumstances, not just individuals. Death toll rising, confinement and isolation limiting our ability to see and help our loved ones, massive job losses, problems with infrastructure, or problems with access to the health and social care we need are just a few examples. A pandemic poses considerable challenges to communities over long periods ranging from weeks to months. Communities must therefore develop means to respond, resist and recover from such events.We often talk about the importance of ""community resilience"". This community resilience would allow better adaptation in order to minimize the impact of a disaster, which would make it easier to return to normal life. By implementing a community resilience plan, a community can come together and overcome any disaster, while rebuilding socially, physically and economically.But community resilience may be a seemingly abstract idea. What is it exactly? A recent, moderate-quality systematic review examined 80 articles to explore the different definitions of community resilience,(3) which can be considered in turn as:1. an ongoing process of adaptation to manage and respond to extraordinary resource demands and losses associated with disasters;2. the absence of negative effects, that is, the ability to maintain relatively stable and healthy levels of psychological and physical functioning; or3. the ability to harness local resources and expertize to participate fully in community recovery from disasters, in a way that complements the response of emergency services. Although definitions vary greatly, the systematic review identified nine key elements of community resilience:1. Improving knowledge and educating the publicthrough public communications to mitigate the effects of a disaster and support responses to emergencies. 2. Fostering social cohesionto create strong community bounds and deal with post-crisis uncertainty. As the COVID-19 pandemic has revealed, maintaining these links through alternative means (by video conference, telephone or social media) is vital. 3. Communicating effectively and transparentlyto help a community articulate, coordinate and understand the risks and effects of disasters. 4. Maintaining the health of communities, to address physical health problems, but also mental-health problems to counter the anxiety, stress and depression generated by traumatic events. 5. Showing strong leadershipbefore, during and after the disaster. 6. Having the necessary resources and allocating them appropriatelyin the community. These resources can be food (water, food), technical (masks and essential medical devices), human, financial and social. 7. Investing in the economysuch as supporting the development of infrastructure to mitigate future risks and diversifying the economy. 8. Planning effective response processesbefore a disaster strikes to reduce risks. 9. Valuing positive thoughts and mental attitudesby emphasizing the hope that things will improve and that we have to accept that things will be different after the crisis, we reduce uncertainty and anxiety among communities. Learning from past events is essential to face future disasters (and perhaps a second wave of COVID-19). You can play an active role in that regard, andtoolkitsavailable to help you:-Learn more about community resilienceso that you can teach others about it; and-Tell others about community resilience, but also share your stories and ideasto improve how your community can respond, resist and recover from disasters.']"

However, challenging times often lead to a lot of reflection. Although we’re several months into 2020, it’s not too late to revisit the goals we had set for ourselves at the start of the year or to identify and commit to new ones. In fact, as we slow down and take a break from our “normal” routines, we’re presented with the opportunity to think about the things we may have been meaning to get to for a while. Not only can we use this time to lay out how we plan to accomplish our goals, but we can even start taking action towards making them a reality. If you’re one of the over one billion people worldwide who smoke tobacco, quitting may be on the top of your wish list (1;2). There are a variety of reasons that can motivate you to put down your cigarettes for good. Premature death and the increased risk of developing heart disease, cancer, stroke, pneumonia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), as well as the immense health benefits of stopping, are just a few (1;3-7). Now, COVID-19 may be another addition to the ever-growing list of reasons to quit. You may be wondering why that is. Well, the World Health Organization has listed a couple of potential links between smoking and COVID-19, although more research is still needed (8;9). First, they suggest that the action of putting your fingers up to your lips/face while smoking could increase the risk of spreading COIVD-19 from your hands, or even the cigarette itself, to your mouth (8). Second, it seems that people who smoke may be at an increased risk of developing severe symptoms and complications from COVID-19—such as the need to be in an intensive care unit or on a ventilator. People who smoke could be more vulnerable to COVID-19 because smoking is already known to increase the risk of respiratory infections such as pneumonia and the flu. Additionally, these folks may also have underlying health conditions, due to smoking, that impact their lung or cardiovascular function (e.g., COPD or heart disease) (9). Be it COVID-19 or some other motivation, quitting smoking is a positive step towards better health. Click the links below to learn more about different strategies that can help you on your path to becoming smoke-free! 1. Consider nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) This over-the-counter treatment comes in a variety of forms including patches, tablets, gums, lozenges, sprays, and inhalers. If you’re motivated to achieve long-term quitting,NRT can improve the chancesof successfully doing so by 50%-60%, and is generally associated with just minor side effects (10). In terms ofhow different NRTs stack up, the fast-acting options (e.g., gums or lozenges) are just as likely as the long-acting ones (e.g., patches) to help people who smoke at least 15 cigarettes/day and want to quit, to stop smoking. On the other hand, combining fast and long-acting NRTs is even more beneficial than using just one form alone (11). Tips for purchasing NRT: 2. Lean on your peers for support Don’t want to go it alone? You don’t have to!Group smoking cessation programs, which allow you to learn and gain strength from those on a similar journey, can increase your chances of quitting by 50%-130% compared to “self-help” (12). They can even be done on their own or coupled with NRT (13). What’s more, in times when in-person group supports are unavailable, you can turn to a wide variety of online group programs to get that at-home support. 3. Seek telephone support from a counsellor In-depthtelephone counselling, which involves receiving multiple calls from counsellors via a smoker’s helpline or health care provider within different settings, is another strategy that can be accessed at home. In fact, receiving in-depth telephone support after reaching out to a smokers’ helpline may increase your chances of quitting by 20%-60%, versus calling into a helpline and only receiving self-help materials and/or one-time counselling. Similarly, if you were/are receiving quitting services within a non-helpline setting, in-depth telephone support provided by a health care provider may increase your chances of success by 15%-35% (14). Like the saying goes, when it comes to making healthy changes in our lives, “there is no time like the present”! If you’re motivated to quit smoking, there are an arsenal of strategies that you can use to help you get started and succeed.']"

The home, retirement home or nursing home may no longer be suitable for the evolving needs of older adults. There are probably multiple options to explore, but it's often difficult to identify which one would be best. And all this must be done while weighing many factors that can influence such a decision. Indeed, a recent systematic review identified no less than 88 factors influencing housing decisions for frail older adults (including factors related to age and health status, access to adequate care and services, or the comfort and safety of the living environment.(1)Housing decisions can become even more complex and stressful in the context of the pandemic that we are currently experiencing. COVID-19 poses significant risks to the health of older adults and people with weakened immune systems. In recent weeks, we have seen several retirement homes and long-term care facilities being overrun by COVID-19 outbreaks.(2) This situation can raise a lot of concerns and questions among older adults, their families and their caregivers regarding the most appropriate and safe place to live during the pandemic. How could we support them in making these complex decisions? Researchers associated with the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, the University of Ottawa and the National Institute on Ageing recently published two decision aids to help older adults, families and their caregivers who are grappling with two questions during the COVID-19 pandemic:-Should I go to live elsewhere or stay in my retirement/assisted living home?(3)-Should I or my family member go to live with family or stay in the long-term care or nursing home?(4) These decision aids aim to help people become involved in the decision by making explicit the decision that needs to be made, providing information about the options (including the potential risks and benefits), and by clarifying your personal values.(5) The two tools present a series of structured questions to help you think about:- who is legally responsible for making such a decision;- the reasons why you are considering leaving your current residence;- the exit and readmission rules of long-term care or nursing homes during the pandemic;- the support available for daily activities and personal care at your new residence;- other things you need to make your decision, andnext steps. Reviews that examined the effectiveness of such decision aids found that they generally help\xa0:- increase knowledge about options;- encourage patient being engaged in decisions;- support realistic perception of outcomes and risk;- reduce decision-related conflict (and level of anxiety);- increase patient-practitioner communication; and- support professionals to provide information and counseling about available choices.(5) If you are contemplating the idea of moving during the pandemic, use decision aids to help you make an informed decision.""]"

Pilates and yoga can help you keep physically and mentally fit!,"['As we try to stop the spread of COVID-19 within our communities, staying at home has become the “new normal” for most folks around the globe—at least for the time being. From interruptions to our daily routines to worries over our health or the health of loved ones, coping with the reality of a pandemic can have implications on all aspects of our wellbeing. On the bright side, there are plenty of strategies that we can add to our “toolbox” to help us keep up our mental, cognitive, and physical health while at home. One important tool to keep handy is exercise! You likely saw that recommendation coming, but this super strategy is so important because it can influence all aspects of health (1-4). Another great thing about exercise is that it can be done in different settings, not just at the gym! It also comes in a variety of forms, meaning most people can find something that interests them, such as resistance training, aerobic exercise, and other non-traditional exercises like Pilates or yoga. In the absence of access to community-based exercise facilities and in-person classes, Pilates and yoga are two examples of mind-body exercises (5;6) that you can do right from the comfort of your own home, using an online class for example. Pilates is defined by characteristics such as flowing movements, and an emphasis on posture, breathing, control, flexibility, and concentration (5;7). Similarly, yoga focuses on postures and movements—such as stretches and holds—coupled with breathing exercises and meditation (6). What’s more, you can alter both exercises to match your abilities, limitations, and preferences. Adjustments can include modifying the level of difficulty or using supports such as chairs or straps (6;7). With a check mark for accessibility and a check mark for adaptability, just what health benefits do these particular exercises offer? Twosystematic reviews, one on Pilates and the other on yoga, looked at the benefits of these exercises on various aspects of physical and mental wellbeing, as well as quality of life (6;7). Thefirst reviewfound that in older adults, Pilates may have a large impact when it comes to improving physical function—for example walking speed, muscle strength, and the ability to accomplish daily activities (such as putting on clothes or walking around the house). Pilates has also been shown to boost mood, by reducing depressive symptoms, and quality of life (7). Aspects such as, dynamic balance (staying balanced while moving around or changing positions), static balance (staying balanced when in an upright position but without moving feet) (7;8), and flexibility may also see small to moderate improvements. In terms of safety, the authors of the review do note that no side effects were reported as a result of practicing Pilates, and suggest that it’s a safe mode of exercise for older adults. Ultimately, the results around Pilates are encouraging, but larger studies looking at more similar outcomes are needed to lend further support on its benefits (7). Thesecond reviewfound that older adults who participated in yoga had a moderate improvement in health-related quality of life and a small increase in mental well-being, compared to those who did not practice yoga. Health-related quality of life takes into consideration physical, mental, emotional, and social functioning, and how these areas impact a person’s health overall. On the other hand, mental-wellbeing looks at whether a person functions well psychologically, and views themselves as being happy and satisfied with life. When it comes to safety, the authors of the review do note that no serious side effects were reported, and yoga was viewed as a safe mode of exercise overall. Again, despite the positive results seen here, more research is still needed to determine the best style of yoga to do, and how much yoga is needed to reap the benefits (6).']"

That said, older adults are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A study conducted in the United States revealed that Internet users over the age of 65 tend to relay more false information on social networks than younger users.(2)At a time when fake news is going viral, how can we fight misinformation? A recent systematic review of moderate quality reviewed 65 studies of interventions to correct misinformation.(3) The results indicate that it is not easy for individuals or organizations to address misinformation. That said : - it seems more difficult to correct misinformation related to political and marketing issues compared to health issues; - it seems more difficult to correct misinformation when it is linked to real issues (for example, misinformation which aims to lead people to believe that some vaccines cause autism), as opposed to misinformation on fictional events (for example, a fake plane crash); - some interventions may not be sufficient to correct misinformation if they are used alone: for example,warningpeople that information could be misleading; “fact checking” to systematically assess the accuracy of information; orappealing to the credibility of sources(which may reflect political polarization and the growing erosion of public trust in official sources of information); and - interventions to correct misinformation should providecoherent explanationsthat describe what really happened and why it happened.

Develop your critical thinking skills byasking 6 questions to see if this information is trustworthy: 1) What’s the source?Examine the trustworthiness of news sources and references behind the claims. 2) What’s in it for them?Examine if the researchers, their funders or the groups sharing the information stand to benefit from the information shared (which could suggest some potential biases). 3) How many people were involved in the study?The more people involved in a study, the more power researchers have to make conclusions and generalize the results to a larger group. 4) Was there a control group?Thehighest quality studies randomly select participants to try the activity or treatment, and compare results to a group that do not participate (for example, a group receiving the new treatment versus a group receiving the standard treatment). This way, they can tease out the benefits of the activity, controlling for other influences. 5) How long did the study last?Short-term measurements of treatment benefits are useful. However, studies that use accurate and reliable ways to measure the effects more than once and over a longer period (say, 6 months or a year later) provide more information about long-term benefits as well as any potential long-term side effects or harms. 6) Will it work for me?Consider your own personal needs, preferences and circumstances when making health decisions.']"

Support may be just a âcouple of clicksâ away!,"['In light of the current COVID-19 pandemic, physical distancing has become a new and necessary element in our daily lives. However, physical distancingdoes nothave to mean social isolation. This is especially important for the almost eight million Canadians who act as caregivers to loved ones living with mental and/or physical disabilities, chronic diseases, or age-related challenges (1). Despite being a fulfilling role with many positives, caregiving is no easy task. Whether you yourself are a caregiver or know someone who is, you’re likely aware of the impact this role can have on the mental, emotional, physical, and social aspects of a carer’s life (2;3). Elevated levels of stress, anxiety, and depression are just a few examples of how the challenges of the role can manifest in the health of those providing the care (2;4;5). Fortunately, support services exist to aid caregivers in carrying out their tasks with greater skill and confidence, while increasing social connections to help decrease the physical and mental burden. Even in times such as these, when accessing in-person services may not be possible, caregivers still don’t have to go it alone. How, you ask? Well, caregivers can take solace in the fact that internet-based strategies exist as an alternative to in-person services. But, are these internet-based strategies effective for caregivers, and what are the features of successful online supports?Onesystematic reviewthat looked at caregivers of older adults with stroke, cancer, traumatic brain injury, and dementia sought to answer these questions (2). This review focused on informal caregivers—most often a spouse, partner, or child—as opposed to those who provide care as part of their occupation. The strategies included within the review fell under three main categories of internet-based support—education strategies, self-help strategies (e.g., support programs that aimed to build certain skills for caregivers or provided tailored materials via online modules), and human-supported strategies (e.g., programs or websites that had educational/skill building elements but always included professional and/or peer support). Internet-based strategies differed by: Ultimately, the review found that internet-based strategies, specifically self-help and human-supported strategies, can improve mental well-being in caregivers of older adults. Depression, anxiety, and caregiver strain were a few areas where some benefits were seen. Successful strategies seemed to be those that included: timely professional advice or peer support accessed remotely, interactive online activities, and instructions to assist caregivers with changing their behaviours (2). In these tumultuous times, caregivers don’t have to cope on their own. If you’re a caregiver for an older adult, seeking out available internet-based support services seems to be a valid option, especially when in-person services are limited or unavailable. When looking for online strategies to use, be sure to consider what kinds of features they offer.']"
112,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/03/25/reading-to-escape-isolation,25 March 2020,Reading to escape isolation,"['We are all cut off from the world right now, given the social and physical distancing and confinement measures associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. It is estimated that in ""normal"" times, about 40% of older adults feel lonely, while 7-17% report being socially isolated. Although these terms are often used interchangeably, social isolation and loneliness are not quite the same.(1) Social isolation refers to a real lack of social support and significant contacts, while loneliness refers to the person\'s belief that he or she is lacking or has lost company and experiences negative feelings that result from it. (2; 3) There is no doubt that the current context risks to exacerbate both social isolation and the feeling of loneliness among many people.In this troubled time when we are isolated, but also bombarded with stressful information, we must find solutions to entertain ourselves and escape (if only for a moment) from this reality. Could reading be a solution? A recent, moderate-quality systematic review identified 51 articles examining the benefits of recreational reading (for fun or for learning) on different populations, including adults with and without health problems.(4)Among adults in general, studies clearly show that reading promotes pleasure, relaxation, a better understanding of oneself and one\'s social identities. As a form of entertainment, it can also help people to “escape” troubled times, but also to open up to other cultures and points of view. Reading also promotes empathy, social inclusion, self-esteem and community cohesion. Finally, some studies show that reading books can also improve memory and attention.If you have special health needs, be aware that reading can help reduce your stress levels and increase your sense of relaxation. Reading can also help reduce some of the symptoms of depression and dementia.Do you like reading fiction novels? Being interested in the characters and understanding their motivations can translate into real life by allowing you to develop social skills such as the ability to understand and share the feelings of another.Do you prefer magazines? Reading magazine articles also has positive effects: for example, if the article in question deals with the benefits of exercise, it will certainly make you think about exercising for your own health! Overall, research evidence indicates that recreational reading can bring a range of benefits to individuals and to society. In the current context of social isolation and confinement, several options are available to you in order to benefit from the pleasures of reading:- Take the opportunity to immerse yourself in books that have been waiting for you;- Revisit the classics that have influenced you (and that have been sleeping in your collection of reading materials for a long time);- Visit the website of your public library (many of them offer digital loans of books and audio books);- Join a virtual book club to share your thoughts about what you are reading or to listen in on a book being read by others; or- Share your passion for reading by reading to other people using video applications like FaceTime, Skype, Zoom, Messenger or others (for example, if you are a long-distance caregiver why not read to your loved ones, or if you are an older adult, why not organize “story time” with your grandchildren).']"
113,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/03/11/elder-abuse-in-rural-and-remote-communities,11 March 2020,Elder abuse in rural and remote communities,"['Elder abuse has been the subject of debate around the world for many years.(1; 2)A recent systematic review found that elder abuse can affect about 16% of adults over the age of 60 in middle and high-income countries.(3) This proportion is considered to be higher among ""at risk” individuals, including people with physical or mental disabilities, and people living in care facilities.Older adults living in rural or remote communities have also been identified as potentially more vulnerable due to geographic and social isolation, as well as difficulty accessing legal and support services. The extreme conditions prevailing in some remote communities can also increase isolation and hardship. Note that in Canada, about 1 in 4 seniors live in rural areas and small towns.(4)Elder abuse can be defined as ""a single or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is a violation of trust, which causes harm or distress of an older person.""(3) This abuse can be take many forms: systemic, physical, sexual, psychological, verbal or financial.While policymakers are trying to address this high-priority issue, we can wonder whether policies adopted to prevent and respond to elder abuse take in consideration those living in rural or remote communities. A recent systematic review of 47 articles examined policy responses to elder abuse in rural and remote communities (with a focus on Australia).(3) Here are some of the key findings:- Very few of policies examined explicitly addressed issues related to rural and remote communities.- Living in a rural or remote community is a factor that increases the vulnerability of older adults to abuse (which seems consistent with previous studies).- Some studies that have looked at elder abuse among farming families pointed out that the solutions require a comprehensive approach, which may include clear succession plans.- Access to information and support for people from rural and remote communities is a priority, as is the importance of better understanding the needs of these communities.- Responses must be developed at the national level, which must however include the development of local resources.- Regarding abuse against Indigenous seniors in rural and remote communities, a consistent and rigid approach is unlikely to be effective. Access to services often requires moving outside of their communities, which can be worrisome for some Indigenous seniors, particularly when it comes to leaving their ""nation"". The importance of developing trauma-informed and culturally-sensitive services was identified. In addition, consulting with members of local indigenous communities was emphasized, in order to identify forms of elder abuse and map existing resources that can be used. Dealing with elder abuse may be challenging, but we can all be part of the solution. We must learn to take three actions:1.Recognizethe different forms and signs of elder abuse (including physical, social and behavioral signs).2.Speakwith the affected older adults.3.Askquestions, get expert advice, and make sure the person is not in danger.(5)']"

But for those who smoke, can accessing support over the phone help them in putting out their cigarettes for good? Every year, around seven million people die as a result of smoking tobacco (1;2). Although a staggering statistic, many of us are familiar with the dangers of smoking—cancer, heart disease, pneumonia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, gum disease, stroke, cataracts, and the list goes on (1-5). In fact, lifetime smokers die an average of 10 years earlier than non-smokers (6-8). Fortunately, quitting smoking brings immediate and long-term health benefits (6;8)—such as fewer complications after a surgery, and a reduced risk of developing a chronic disease and premature death (6;8;9). To the over one billion folks who smoke globally (6;10), the benefits of quitting, along with the wide variety of support strategies that are now available, should bring hope and motivation. One strategy that aims to help those who smoke find success at the end of their quit journey is telephone counselling (1). Some telephone counselling services are ‘on-demand’, while others are more ‘in-depth’. Smoking helplines or quitlines can offer both levels of service. Their on-demand features allow individuals who smoke or their family members to call in and get information on smoking, or brief advice about quitting. Other, more in-depth, services include counsellors connecting with individuals and scheduling ongoing calls as needed, or the opportunity to register in structured programs with calls from a counsellor built in (1;11-13). In-depth telephone counselling can also be provided by other health care providers in different settings (1). So, should people who smoke rush to the phone lines? One recentsystematic reviewlooked at telephone counselling as an approach for helping people who smoke—mainly adults in the general population—to quit. The review’s authors made two key findings. First, the chances of quitting may be higher in people who receive continuing telephone support (e.g., one or more additional calls) from a counsellor after calling into a helpline, compared to people who call the helpline and then receive self-help materials and/or counselling limited to one call. In fact, the chances of stopping could be 20% to 60% higher in those getting ongoing phone support initiated by a counsellor. Second, telephone support initiated by a counsellor or health care provider in settings outside of helplines where folks are receiving other forms of quitting assistance (e.g., medication, self-help materials, etc.), may also increase the likelihood of successfully quitting. With this type of counselling, it's reported that the chances of quitting could be 15% to 35% higher. At this time, more research on the effects of on-demand telephone counselling, as well as a better understanding of different aspects of telephone counselling programs—such as the number of phone calls received, timing of calls, and combination with other quitting strategies—is needed (1). If you’re looking to quit smoking, consider checking out your local, regional, or national smoking helpline to see if you can register for in-depth telephone counselling services.

It relates to the handling, preparation, and storage of\xa0food\xa0in ways that prevent\xa0foodborne illness.(2)Food can be contaminated with bacteria, viruses or parasites. The main pathogenic bacteria in food are Campylobacter and salmonella, as well as Listeria and Escherichia coli (known as \'E. Coli\'). Every year, one in eight Canadians fall ill after consuming contaminated or undercooked food, which results in staggering costs for individuals, the health system and society as a whole.(3, 4)Most people are fully recover from foodborne illness or intoxication. However, older adults are at higher risk of getting listeriosis and have higher rates of hospitalization and death if they are infected with salmonella or Campylobacter.But what do we know about the food safety knowledge and practices of community-dwelling older adults? A recent study revealed that Canadians are becoming less aware of how to safely handle and prepare food to avoid foodborne illness and food poisoning.(4) Do you defrost meat over the counter, like 24% of older Canadians? Do you wash poultry before cooking, like 68% of older Canadians?(4) These behaviours increase the risk of intoxication, as does eating eggs that have runny yolks.A recent and high-quality systematic review could also shed light on this issue. The review examined 36 studies of food safety knowledge and practices of consumers aged 60 years and older who live at home and prepare food for themselves or others.(5) Food safety can begin at home with some of these tips.Refrigerate your leftoversDid you know that perishable food should not be left out for more than two hours at room temperature? The good thing is that the majority of older adults (87%) are aware of the importance of refrigerating or freezing food rapidly.Wash your hands before or after handling raw meatTo reduce the growth of bacteria and cross-contamination, wash your hands, utensils and cooking surfaces. Most older adults who participated in the studies say that they wash their hands before cooking. That being said, we see a discrepancy between studies where older adult self-report their behaviours in contrast to studies where older adults are observed. In the latter case, observations seem to indicate that older adults may not wash their hands as often...Check your refrigerator temperatureMake sure the fridge is set to no more than 4 degrees Celsius, and the freezer to -18 degrees Celsius. Surveys in the United Kingdom and New Zealand have shown that most refrigerators unfortunately operate above recommended temperatures. In addition, a good practice for keeping your refrigerator cold is to limit the number of times you open it and the length of time you leave it open.Be cautious about at risk foodMany people consume undercooked food, which increases the risk for pathogens. At risk food may include eggs, soft cheeses, cured meats and seafood. However, the risk may differ from country to country due to differences in food production and processing practices. For example, hens are vaccinated against salmonella in some countries.Check expiration datesYou must check the ""best before"" date indicated on the packaging and make sure to cook or freeze meat, fish and seafood before this date. Older adults who participated in the studies typically checked the expiration dates, which suggests that they are concerned about the quality and safety of the food they eat.Be aware of pathogensSurveys have shown that older adults are generally aware of E. Coli and salmonella, but not Listeria. Since older adults constitute a high-risk population for listeriosis, family members, friends or health and social services professionals should not hesitate to provide them with information on food safety practices.']"

While people with IBD often feel embarrassed about their condition, there is no shame in it. Talking about IBD can lead to finding better ways to cope. IBD is an umbrella term that describes chronic inflammatory conditions that affect the digestive tract—which includes the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines (1-5). Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis are the most common forms of IBD (6). In North America, over 1.6 million people live with IBD (1;7-8), including around 270,000 Canadians—projected to be 400,000 by 2030 (9). And you guessed it…the fastest growing group of Canadians with IBD is adults aged 65 years old and over (9;10). The cause of IBD is still a mystery, but it is thought to arise when environmental factors (e.g., infections, antibiotics, etc.) prompt the immune system to mistakenly attack microorganisms and food in the gut, producing inflammation in the digestive tract. Genetics may also play a role in increasing the risk of IBD (1-4;11). Typically, the disease alternates between periods of inactivity (a.k.a. remission) and periods when symptoms flare-up (a.k.a. relapse) (2-4). Unfortunately, there is no cure for IBD. Instead, go-to medications often aim to reduce inflammation or suppress the immune system to get and keep people in remission (2-5). Many of these medications can come with potentially serious side effects, such as lymphoma, non-melanoma skin cancers, and liver issues (9). One popular and highly debated alternative treatment option is cannabis (2;4). With cannabis touted as a one stop-shop for many of our medical needs, and its increasing accessibility through legalization, where does the evidence stand on its use for Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, specifically? Two recentsystematic reviews—oneincluding patients with active Crohn’s (2) andthe otherincluding\xa0 patients with active ulcerative colitis (4)—looked at the effect of cannabis cigarettes and cannabis oil on outcomes such as disease remission or activity, inflammation, side effects, and quality of life. When reported on, neither review found that cannabis cigarettes or cannabis oil induced remission in patients with active disease or helped with inflammation (2;4). In both Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis, cannabis cigarettes led to a reduction in disease activity (2;4), but in Crohn’s patients, this was accompanied by an increase in mild side effects such as memory loss, drowsiness, confusion, dizziness, and trouble concentrating (2). Cannabis oil produced potentially meaningful increases in quality of life in both types of IBD (2;4), but in patients with ulcerative colitis, this strategy was associated with mild to moderately severe side effects such as headache, tiredness, dizziness, nausea, and trouble concentrating (4). So, what should patients and caregivers affected by Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis make of these findings? Ultimately, the evidence-base around the use of cannabis and\xa0cannabis oil for Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis is not of high quality. This means, at this time, no concrete conclusions about the effectiveness or safety of cannabis and cannabis oil can be made. Ideally, future research will include a larger number of participants, account for different disease statuses (e.g., active and inactive), and evaluate different types/doses of cannabis (2;4). If you’re considering using cannabis or cannabis oil to treat your Crohn’s or ulcerative colitis, reach out to your health care provider to help you navigate the potential harms and benefits and factor in where the current evidence lies.']"

The scarcity of affordable housing, the stress caused by a move, as well as having to move away from friends and family are all factors that may further isolate older adults.Many older adults face complex (and sometimes heartbreaking) housing decisions.(1) When we think of housing options for older adults, we often think of their own homes, retirement homes, seniors\' residences, nursing homes or other long-term care facilities. But what you may not know, is that other options exist, such as ""co-housing"".Co-housing is an idea that emerged in Denmark in the 1960s.(2) It is a community of private houses grouped around a shared space. The goal of co-housing is to have a group of people live together as a community, without however resembling a commune. Each house has its own private bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom. Shared spaces typically include a common building, which can include a large kitchen and dining area, laundry facilities and recreational areas. The shared outdoor space may include parking, driveways, open space and gardens. Each individual or family has independent income and a private life, but the members of a co-housing project will plan and manage community activities and shared spaces collaboratively. Co-housing projects are often multigenerational but can sometimes target seniors. Co-housing projects are based on values of engagement, collaboration, interdependence, mutual support and even ""co-care"" (members thus taking care of each other).This model seems to be gaining in popularity. The Canadian Cohousing Network identified dozens of communities at different stages of development across the country.(3) But what are the success factors for co-housing projects for older adults? A recent systematic review of 60 articles examined the reasons cited by older adults for supporting co-housing, interpersonal issues in such projects, and other implementation considerations such as privacy, accessibility and security.(4) Reasons to live togetherCo-housing involves a way of life that values private as much as community life, which seems particularly attractive to older adults. Studies also shown that seniors who turn to co-housing enjoy being able to reduce housing costs, feel safe, share household chores and increase their social interactions.Profile of members of cohabitation projectsAlthough older adults positively consider co-housing with younger generations and do not exclude minority groups, they nevertheless want to have a say in the people with whom they will share their daily lives to ensure that there is a good compatibility.The mechanisms to maintain healthy interpersonal relationships are essential in co-housing projects. You have to learn respect, tolerance and the art of compromise but also establish clear rules related to decision-making processes, the use and maintenance of shared spaces, noise, cost sharing, visitors, pets, alcohol consumption, or smoking. Studies show that such rules seem essential to ensure living together is successful.It’s important to get to know the people you will be living with in order to establish rules that everyone agrees to. External help from third parties, such as organizations matching individuals and families with co-housing projects, can be beneficial. Privacy, accessibility and securityThe balance between shared spaces and private spaces is a key factor in any successful co-housing project. Living together must not compromise the residents\' need for privacy. In addition, whether it\'s about sharing existing houses or new constructions dedicated to co-housing, accessibility and security features must meet the needs of older adults (needs which may evolve according to their health status). The proximity of the co-housing project to health and social services therefore remains an important consideration.In the case of new construction for co-housing projects, you must also ensure that you obtain professional advice in order to comply with the existing housing and town planning regulations specific to your municipality. Learn more about co-housing (and about yourself!)to find out if this model resonates with your values and can meet your needs.(5) Learn about existing co-housing projects or about those in developmentin order to better understand their respective characteristics and their members (and consider contacting them in order to schedule visits).(3) Start a co-housing projectif no project exists in your community or if none seems to meet your values and needs.(6)']"

The use of these terms interchangeably can leave us getting Shakespearean and asking, what’s in a name? In this case, the answer is nothing. These three names all refer to the same medication, the only difference being that Tylenol is a brand name, while acetaminophen and paracetamol are generic names. Tylenol is a common fixture in many of our medicine cabinets. It’s one of our go-to methods for relief from fevers, and all sorts of aches and pains. One particular kind of pain that has us opening those cabinet doors is arthritis pain (1). Over 4.7 million Canadians aged 50 years and older live with arthritis (2). When it comes to the top contributors of disability worldwide (1;3), osteoarthritis—the most common type of arthritis (4;5)—makes the list (3). Because osteoarthritis pain hinders our ability to move and function well physically (1), managing it is an important goal for both patients and doctors. Joints that carry our weight (4), such as the knees and hips, are locations that often bare the negative consequences of osteoarthritis (3;6). But just what is the first treatment option most often recommend for treating knee and hip osteoarthritis pain? You guessed it…Tylenol (1;7-8). Interestingly, as the evidence-base on the use of Tylenol grows, so does the debate around its use for treating knee and hip osteoarthritis. In particular, issues around how effective and safe this treatment option is are being raised (1;9-11). Arecentsystematic reviewcomparing the use of paracetamol (a.k.a. acetaminophen or Tylenol) versusplacebofor treating knee and hip osteoarthritis reported several interesting findings. First and foremost, when it comes to pain, in both the immediate term (two weeks or less) and short-term (more than two weeks but three months or less), Tylenol only provides marginal improvements. Second, while Tylenol most likely does not enhance physical function immediately, it does provide small improvements in the short-term. With that said, in all instances where benefits were seen, the size of the difference was so small that the authors concluded that taking Tylenol daily likely would not make a meaningful impact on the lives of folks with knee and hip osteoarthritis in the immediate term or short-term. What about the potential for negative side effects? Overall, people with knee and hip osteoarthritis taking Tylenol do not appear to have a higher chance of experiencing negative side effects. Also worth mentioning, is that the risk of an abnormal liver function test—which relates to liver toxicity—may increase with Tylenol use. But this finding lacks certainty because of the reliability of the evidence. Remember, in terms of safety, always use medications as instructed by the package or a pharmacist, or as prescribed by a health care provider. Taking into consideration both the findings on the limited benefits and the potential for harms, the authors of the review call for the use of Tylenol as the first-treatment option for people with knee or hip osteoarthritis to be reevaluated (1). This might leave some wondering, if not Tylenol than what? Doctors will often recommend over-the-counter nonâ\x80\x90steroidal antiâ\x80\x90inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)—such ascelecoxib,diclofenac,ibuprofen, andnaproxen—when Tylenol is not cutting it (1;12-14).Evidence showsthat oral NSAIDs—specificallydiclofenac,ibuprofen, andnaproxen—are more effective in reducing pain than Tylenol in people with knee osteoarthritis. Oral NSAIDs can also be more effective than Tylenol in improving both physical functioning and reducing stiffness (14). Despite this, Tylenol is often used as a first-line treatment because it‘s seen as being a safer option (1). For instance, NSAIDs may come with an increased risk of heart attack and/gastrointestinal issues (14;15). More research comparing the safety of these treatment options is needed (14). Non-drug options for dealing with knee or hip osteoarthritis—including exercise, acupuncture, and surgery—can also be effective. Click on the links below for more information on these strategies: All in all, these results do not mean you should be eager to stop a treatment recommended by your health care provider or start a new one they have not recommended. Instead, open a discussion about the different drug and non-drug treatment options available and the pros and cons of each for you.']"
119,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2020/01/29/grandparents-raising-grandchildren-social-support-needed,29 January 2020,Grandparents raising grandchildren: Social support needed,"[""The profile of families has changed over the years. One of the changes we see is that grandparents are increasingly becoming the primary caregivers of their grandchildren.According to Statistics Canada, it is estimated that almost 50% of Canadians aged 45 and over are grandparents.(1) Almost 8% of those live with their grandchildren in a shared household.(2) But it is not a Canadian phenomenon. It is estimated that almost 2.7 million grandparents were the primary caregivers of their grandchildren in the United States. In Australia, more than 25% of children under the age of 12 receive regular care from their grandparents. In China, the massive migration of parents to urban centres means that more than 25% of children live with their grandparents in rural areas.(3) Taking care of your grandchildren can be one of the most rewarding experiences: being able to be much more closely connected to your grandchildren's world, and providing them stability, safety, wisdom, and love.\xa0However, some grandparents (as many other caregivers) may face challenges such as burnout, stress, anxiety and depression. Could interventions to support these grandparents better equip them to face their new parenting responsibilities and help to reduce the negative psychological effects they may experience? A recent high-quality systematic review has looked into this issue.(3) This review analyzed 20 studies examining the effectiveness of various interventions aimed at improving the well-being of grandparents raising grandchildren. Although Hispanic and Caucasian grandparents were included in some interventions, the characteristics of the participants generally reflect the profiles of grandparents living with their grandchildren in the United States, with an over-representation of African American grandmothers who are raising their grandchildren. The participants, aged 55 and 62, were mostly divorced, separated or widowed, unemployed and with a low level of education.Group interventions: support and educationSupport and education are two important components of group interventions, as several studies have shown. Support groups are inexpensive, easy to set up, and appeared effective. To respond to the problems raised by grandparents, various educational components are adapted to their needs: identification of stress factors, improvement of coping strategies, parenting training, management of interpersonal relationships, identification of resources available, and practical skills to cope with stress.Grandparents will also be able to develop better interpersonal skills, which will help them establish clear rules with the parents of their grandchildren, as well as reduce potential sources of conflict that may exacerbate their stress.As for training, these can be given in different formats to adapt to the context of each: in-person presentations, videos, workbooks, online platforms.Personalized interventions: home visits by professionalsPersonalized services are also provided to grandparents as part of several interventions. For example, home visits by social workers and registered nurses can help them set goals for improving their physical and psychological well-being, as well as increasing their access to resources and social support. In addition to the management of special cases by social workers, registered nurses perform care needs assessments.Significant effects on grandparentsThese interventions can have positive mental health effects, including reduced stress, anxiety and depression. Improving the mental health of grandparents can be a long-term task, as stress, anxiety and depression are associated with complex factors, such as evolving child-care needs, insufficient social support, or family tensions and other relational strains.We see that reducing social isolation must be at the forefront of interventions for grandparents raising grandchildren. A comprehensive family approach that takes into account the needs of grandparents, parents and children is also promising. In fact, we need to increase social support, but also reduce conflicts between grandparents and other family members.… and with grandchildren!Children raised by their grandparents may exhibit behavioural problems due to feelings of abandonment, neglect and abuse or their exposure to parental addiction. Supporting and updating education strategies helps grandparents to act appropriately to reduce the difficulties experienced by their grandchildren.Thanks to targeted interventions, everyone benefits and sees their quality of life improved.""]"

There are thousands of Paleo recipes on the internet, and Paleo offerings are popping up more and more on restaurant menus...or even as whole Paleo themed restaurants. But what is Paleo, exactly? And is it good for our hearts? The Paleo diet encourages us to eat like our hunter and gatherer ancestors did more than 10,000 years ago, before the rise of agriculture and processed foods (1-4). It involves eating lots of fish, vegetables, fruits, lean meat, eggs, and nuts. On the other hand, dairy, grains, processed foods, coffee, alcohol, sugar, and salt are off-limits (1;3;5-8). At first glance, the Paleo diet looks pretty healthy—after all, it tends to be lower in calories from processed fats and sodium, and higher in protein, vitamins C and E, and fiber (1;9-14). This has led many Paleo proponents to argue that this diet is a good way to combat the world’s biggest killer—heart disease (1;15)—which often arises when our blood vessels narrow or become blocked, leading to issues like heart attack and stroke (16). Putting another check in Paleo’s box, heart disease is lower in tribal populations that have continued to follow the hunter-gatherer lifestyle and eat a Paleo-like diet (1;17). So, the Paleo diet is a great way to keep our hearts ticking along nicely, right? Unfortunately, the answer is not so cut-and-dry. Let’s take a look at where the evidence stands. Two recentsystematic reviewsfound that the Paleo diet can lead to weight loss, trim the waistline, and lower body mass index (1;3). One ofthese reviewsalso found that the Paleo diet may impact other risk factors for heart disease by increasing the concentration of certain fats found in the blood like HDL (“good”) cholesterol, and lowering blood pressure, inflammation, and the concertation of other fats like triglycerides, total cholesterol, and LDL (“bad”) cholesterol. However, these latter findings didn’t hold up when researchers removed certain studies from their calculations, so they’re deemed less reliable and should be looked at more carefully (1). It’s also important to note that the reviews themselves were small in terms of the number participants included. In the end, more high-quality research is needed in this area to provide firm conclusions on the benefits of this diet on risk factors for heart disease (1;3). Neither review paid much attention to the cons of the Paleo diet (1;3), but if you’re thinking of adopting this diet, you should consider them carefully! For example, the Paleo diet cuts out dairy, which may impact your calcium levels, a key element for bone health (1;18). If following the Paleo diet, it’s important to ensure you’re getting the needed amount of daily calcium from other food sources. The Paleo diet also recommends getting just one-third of your daily calories from carbohydrates, making it a “low-carb” diet. The safety of diets that restrict carbohydrate consumption to this degree is heavily debated and needs to be assessed further (1;19). So, can the Paleo diet benefit our heart health? On the whole, there is some promising evidence, but it’s far from concrete. Before embarking on any drastic changes to your diet, speak with your health care provider or a certified nutritionist to make sure that any changes you plan to make are safe for you.']"

In countries that are part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 10% of adults provide informal (unpaid) care for family members or friends. This percentage is around 20% in Canada, which represents more than 8 million Canadians.(1)In a context where families have fewer children to care for their aging parents, where women are increasingly affected by caregiving duties (and juggling many other priorities) (1) and where children sometimes live more than an hour away from their parents ( 2), it should come as no surprise that family caregivers carry a heavy burden and experience physical, emotional and financial problems (among others). This is particularly the case in hard-to-reach communities, where there is great distance from urban centres or where services are scattered or scarce, In these communities, older adults are often more dependent on their family.\xa0\xa0But what is known about support for these family caregivers? A systematic review examined 14 studies published after 2012, which was the European year of active Ageing\xa0and Solidarity between Generations, that focused on helping family caregivers in rural and hard-to-reach communities.(3) These studies have been carried out in the United States (7), Sweden (3), Portugal, in Canada, Australia and Thailand. Overall, the research evidence resonates with findings from other systematic reviews or related studies: few caregivers receive enough recognition, support or training.(4) However, the review clearly identified three areas of support and intervention needed by family caregivers in hard-to-reach communities: overcoming isolation, acquiring skills and knowledge and increasing accessibility to services.(3) Overcoming isolationCaregivers often feel discouraged, isolated and stressed by the intensity of the task and the magnitude of the care, which can lead to physical health problems and depression. These problems tend to increase in remote areas where transportation services and support for caregivers are less likely to exist, which may exacerbate the feeling of social and geographic isolation.Caregivers need psychosocial services to improve their mental health and enable them to provide quality care to their loved ones. There are different types of support, whether individual or group meetings or even by phone. Just being able to chat with people who share similar stories helps reduce stress, create a social network and share best practices to care for their loved one (and for themselves).Acquiring skills and knowledgeSince the health problems of older adults are often complex, many family caregivers would benefit from specialized training to help them better manage symptoms and know how to provide optimal care. They would thus be able to play their role to prevent adverse events with much more confidence and success, while decreasing their level of stress.Certain technologies can to overcome (to some extent) the limited access to services. Most studies have used technological tools to reach caregivers in remote areas, which has improved skills while reducing feelings of social isolation, depression and stress. However, studies also show that the benefits of technologies are the same as those of telephone support, which could, for example, be used for people with limited ease or comfort with new technologies.There are therefore several solutions for training caregivers, giving them the tools to develop their skills to care for their loved ones (making them confident in their abilities), including workshops given by experts, educational softwares, printed guides, videos and webinars, telephone support, videoconferences given by a psychologist, physician or social worker, etc.Increasing accessibility to servicesMany studies pointed out that psychological and educational support is compounded by the inaccessibility of services in rural and remote areas. In addition, although the use of technological interventions may reduce the cost of providing certain services, because workshops, webinars, etc. can be posted on a website available to all caregivers, the studies examined in the review didn't reveal other reasons to prefer them to in-person support. The reality of living and providing care to loved ones in hard-to-reach communities remains complex. It is thus important\xa0for policymakers to engage family caregivers and other adults in designing programs and services that meet their needs. Caregivers are experts of their communities, knowing what challenges they are facing and potential solutions that could address them.""]"

One area that nutrition can have an impact on is ‘body composition’ or more simply, the make-up of our bodies. Body composition refers to the proportion of fat, bone, and muscle in the body (1). As you can imagine, like with most things, having too much or too little of certain aspects of body composition can lead to a variety of health issues. Take for example having an excess amount of body fat—as is the case with obesity. Individuals who are obese are at a greater risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease (1;3;4). On the other hand, people with low bone mass are more likely to break a bone (5-7). Unfortunately, it’s hard to clearly define what optimal body composition looks like for everyone. This is because various factors such as sex and age impact the make-up of our bodies. With that said, we can certainly still engage in practices or implement strategies that help us enhance aspects of our body composition (1), and as a result our health. Oneumbrella reviewexplored whether nutritional strategies for weight gain in underweight older adults and weight loss in overweight older adults could help those living in the community improve their body composition. Here, nutritional strategies included diets, nutritional counselling, oral nutritional supplements (e.g., amino acids, creatine, alpha-linoleic acid, beta-methylbutyrate, leucin, or protein), or any combination of the three. Although not a nutritional strategy, exercise was also looked at in some cases. Body composition was measured using nutritional status (e.g., proportion of underweight or overweight people), fat mass, lean mass (body mass consisting of organs, muscle, and bone, but excluding fat), body mass index (BMI) or weight, and bone mass. The results were promising—with several strategies appearing to help enhance body composition in older adults! For underweight older adults, results showed that oral nutritional supplements alone or in combination with resistance training could increase lean body mass and weight. Nutritional supplements on their own may also increase bone mineral density, while nutritional counselling on its own may improve nutritional status (e.g., reduce the proportion of underweight people). What’s more, in cases where it was necessary to use counselling as a first-line strategy and add supplements as a secondary strategy—for instance, to meet certain standards for protein or calorie consumption—an increase in weight could be seen. Despite the potential benefits of taking supplements, their long-term use may be limited, as some people found them hard to stick with because of the taste or nausea and stomach discomfort that they occasionally caused. For overweight adults, results showed that diet changes in combination with exercise could help achieve weight loss. Dietary strategies included things like lowering fat or caloric intake or attending cooking classes. Similar effects were seen when nutritional counselling was added to the mix. However, the weight loss that occurred from the combination of these three strategies was associated with decreases in bone mineral density that could be harmful in very old individuals. Nutritional counselling on its own also appeared to lead to weight loss in this population. So, there you have it, several nutritional strategies—including nutritional counselling, supplements, and dietary changes—can help those with different body types improve aspects of their body composition. Furthermore, combining multiple strategies may provide greater benefits than using a single strategy (1). Start a conversation with your health care provider about your individual body composition. Ask whether any changes are needed, and which combination of nutritional strategies (e.g., specific supplements, diets, etc.) could be of help to you.']"

According to Statistics Canada, 54% of them eat out once a week or more, and 40% of people say they eat out because it is more convenient, they don\'t have time to cook, or they don\'t like or know how to cook.(1) In fact, Canadians spend more time watching cooking shows than actually cooking, and they spend less time eating than almost anyone else in the world.(2)Some initiatives, such as collective kitchens, have been launched here and abroad to meet the nutritional, economic and social needs of people in the community. Although these collective kitchens can take various forms, they generally allow groups to prepare meals in large quantities. They will have the opportunity to enjoy their meals together, but also to bring them home. Educational activities can also be planned on topics of interest (for example, Canada\'s Food Guide, the use of certain equipment in the kitchen, or food safety).These collective kitchens can promote food security for participants, by increasing physical and economic access to adequate amounts of healthy and nutritious food. Such initiatives also aim to help participants prepare meals on a limited budget, develop their food knowledge and cooking skills, but also create social ties around the stoves. These initiatives are often funded or managed by local organizations or charities, although some receive additional funding or resources from the private sector.(3; 4) But what can we learn from research evidence on such initiatives? A systematic review reviewed 13 studies that evaluated courses as part of collective kitchens in the United Kingdom to determine their effectiveness and relevance.(5) The 13 studies were aimed at teaching cooking skills to low-income groups, to certain ethnocultural groups, as well as groups of elderly people or people living with specific health conditions. All the courses were offered in disadvantaged areas, generally in community centres. Some courses were aimed at existing community groups, rather than individuals.The most common approach was to use tutors who were likely to know the local community: they could be trained volunteers or professionals. The tutor’s role was to communicate health messages in an accessible way and to help people develop practical skills for shopping, preparing meals, and food safety so that they could eat healthier on a low budget.The studies examined in this review have not demonstrated that these courses had positive health effects, due to the small number of studies and certain methodological biases. However, data from a study of peer-run cooking clubs (called ""Food Clubs"") offered to people aged 65 and over in socially disadvantaged areas could have beneficial effects.These Food Clubs aimed to improve the participants\' knowledge, attitudes and eating practices. Participants aged 60 and over, without professional health training, were recruited to manage the clubs. The courses, which included training in practical skills, food safety and healthy eating, lasted two hours per week for 20 weeks. Food Clubs were formed from focus groups and interviews with older adults, health workers, community dieticians and community nutrition assistants. Educational materials and recipes were then developed in collaboration with a specialist in consumer economics and a dietician.Although there is no evidence that the participants\' overall diet improved significantly, participants nevertheless greatly appreciated these Food Clubs mainly for social reasons, but also because they liked to learn from people their age. Coming together to learn new things, to cook for fun or to network is in itself a great success, as it allows older adults to break social isolation and maintain an active lifestyle.If you want to join a collective kitchen, contact your municipality to learn about active collective kitchens in your area.(4)However, there may not be an active collective kitchen near you. So why not start your own collective kitchen with members of your community! Someguidescover everything you need to know to start and manage a collective kitchen.(3)']"

This might explain why three-quarters of us take dietary supplements with the hope of boosting our health (1). Clearly, we are a captive market. The challenge comes in teasing out which health claims are true. In some cases, such as in those with certain health conditions or a poor diet, supplements may be a beneficial strategy (2). Dietary supplements, however, are not closely regulated (3), and many have failed to live up to their promises of preventing or reversing chronic diseases. Aside from the costs, taking supplements can lead us to adopt a supplement regimen that is potentially dangerous or interferes with our prescribed medications (4). What do we currently know about some of the most popular supplements? Click on the links to find out more about the research and the myth-busting results. If you’re on antibiotics, taking Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobaccilus casei, and Bifidobacterium lactis—which are all probiotics—can reduce your risk of diarrhea fromClostridium difficile(5;6). Probiotics might also help treat stomach issues like irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation (7). Digestive problems? Try probiotics If you plan to get your flu shot, you’re in luck—taking prebiotic and probiotic supplements for at least two weeks before you get your shot may give you an extra boost of immunity against certain strains of the flu virus. Healthy older adults who take the supplements for a longer period of time may benefit most (8). Help flu shots stick with prebiotics and probiotics? Despite its popularity, taking vitamin C does not prevent colds, except maybe in people who do regular intense exercise in the cold like soldiers, marathon runners, or skiers. The good news? If you do get sick, taking vitamin C may knock a day off your cold and reduce the severity of your symptoms—but only if you take it regularly and not just when a cold strikes (9). Does vitamin C help with the common cold? Hoping to avoid an acute respiratory tract infection, so things like the common cold, ear infections, bronchitis and pneumonia? Vitamin D3 supplements can help, particularly if you are vitamin D-deficient and take the supplements regularly. Unfortunately, if a respiratory infection has taken hold, vitamin D does not lower your chance of being hospitalized or visiting the emergency department (10). Can vitamin D ward off acute respiratory tract infections? In people with type 2 diabetes, promising results show that vitamin D supplements can lower blood sugar levels. The optimal dosage and duration of vitamin D consumption seems to be taking ≥ 1000 IU/daily for more than 12 weeks. The caveat: supplements appear only effective in people who are not obese, and/or have a vitamin D deficiency (11). Vitamin D: A possible ally in the fight against diabetes Is preventing broken bones top-of-mind? The combination of vitamin D plus calcium supplements helps lower the risk in older adults. However, the cons might outweigh the benefits in people with or at risk of kidney stones, kidney disease, high calcium levels, gastrointestinal disease, or heart disease (12). Vitamin D and calcium: A dynamic duo in the maintenance of strong bones For people with high blood pressure, regularly taking fish-oil supplements can lower blood pressure by a small amount. With that said, supplements should not replace prescription blood pressure medications (13), instead they can be used as an additional strategy. Fish-oil supplements: another weapon against high blood pressure In people who have been diagnosed with heart problems, taking fatty acid supplements like omega-3 or omega-6 will not lower the risk of heart attack. Omega-3’s may somewhat improve heart health in other ways, but more research is needed around this (14). Don’t rely on fatty acid supplements for protection against heart disease On this issue, the evidence is clear—antioxidant vitamins do not prevent eye diseases such as age-related cataracts or age-related macular degeneration (AMD) (15). However, they may slow down the progression of AMD in those who already have it (16). Antioxidant vitamins for eye health? Research evidence provides clarity Although diet plays an important role in our overall health and in reducing cancer risk, currently there is little to no quality evidence that supports the use of dietary supplements as a strategy for cancer prevention (17-19). Take for example, the mineral selenium. Over the years, selenium supplements have been promoted by some studies as cancer preventing. However, more recent evidence shows that selenium supplements are unlikely to lower your risk of cancer, and may even increase your chances of certain types of cancer and other chronic diseases (20). Do dietary supplements help reduce cancer risk? Selenium and cancer: Friends or foes? Unfortunately, promises that over-the-counter vitamin and mineral supplements can prevent cognitive decline have come up empty (21;22). There is currently no good evidence to support their use in people with or without cognitive impairment for this purpose. Preventing dementia: Are vitamin and mineral supplements worth the money? Ultimately, regardless of whether different dietary supplements are backed by evidence or not, always be sure to consult your health care provider or pharmacist before using them to tackle your health woes. These discussions will help you understand the potential positive and negative impacts on your health as an individual, especially since vitamins aren’t safe for everyone.']"

By sharing their cultural and culinary heritage, they have made a simple gesture that allows them to maintain their individual and social identity. And this contributes to active aging, and therefore to better physical and mental health.In all cultures, every day, people perform activities related to food. These activities have an important and positive symbolic role, because they allow family and social ties to be forged, and crystallize the very identity of a person.Among older adults, the ability - or inability - to participate in these activities affects their perception of identity. Changes due to aging can prevent them from performing these activities, restrict their participation in social situations involving food and increase the risk of malnutrition, which will reduce their well-being and increase their feeling of isolation and loss of sense.(1; 2)How can older adults maintain their identity and mental well-being? Can participating in activities like cooking and eating be helpful? A systematic review of 22 studies examined the relationship between eating habits of older adults and maintaining their identity.(3) The studies have been conducted in a wide range of cultural contexts, with majority or minority groups, in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, New Zealand, Thailand, Spain and Chile.The analysis revealed that various identities were maintained by preparing traditional meals, eating traditional foods and shopping for groceries, as these activities are social in nature and help to share joyful moments with others. Since women are traditionally responsible for preparing meals in many cultures, researchers have found that continuing to prepare traditional meals (depending on the country of origin or celebrations), selecting the right foods, or skillfully combining seasonings so that the meal was tasty and appreciated by others, had a positive effect on the preservation of ethnic and gender identities despite aging. The self-esteem of older adults who perpetuated culinary traditions was maintained, thereby contributing to their well-being.Also, it seems that grocery shopping offers an opportunity for identity building, thanks to the creation of a social support network characterized by friendships developed with shop employees and other customers.Changes in health status, loss of independence, widowhood or social isolation, however, pose threats to the well-being of older adults. These changes can lead to lower self-esteem and social invisibility. Indeed, no longer having the autonomy required to prepare meals themselves or to fulfill obligations related to their gender, some seniors are experiencing a real identity crisis and are sometimes excluded from certain social events. For example, a newly bereaved man who must learn to cook or an elderly woman who must delegate the preparation of meals to her husband, because she is no longer able to take care of them, could feel deprived of their identity. Maintaining identity and autonomy as we age, across all genders, is complex.Invite older adults to share their recipes, as well as their culinary skills and knowledge. Involve them in planning and preparing meals. Food activities are far from trivial. They are a source of happiness and identity for all of us.']"

Fortunately, for those of us that enjoy that brackish briny kick, there are many salt substitutes out there. The question is…are they good for you? What's the issue? Salt is a major source of dietary sodium (1;2), and consuming too much sodium increases the risk of stroke, heart disease, and in particular, high blood pressure (2-5;6). Affecting more than 4.5 million Canadians (7), high blood pressure is known as ‘the silent killer’ because it often develops without symptoms. When left uncontrolled, it can lead to heart attacks, heart failure,aneurysms, andmetabolic syndrome(6). This is why sodium reduction is now recognized as an important way to prevent major chronic diseases (8;9). Sodium isn’t all bad. In fact, it's absolutely necessary for the body to function (1). According to Canadian guidelines, older adults 51-70 years old should consume 1300 mg of sodium daily, and older adults over 70 should consume 1200 mg (10). This amounts to roughly one-quarter of a teaspoon. The problem is that many of us consume far too much sodium (2)—often more than double the recommended amount (2;11;12)! To cut down on sodium, some people are turning to the plentiful supply of low-sodium salt substitutes. These substitutes are made with less sodium and more of another mineral—most often potassium. But with salt substitutes being so readily available, should we be reaching to place them in our grocery carts? Arecentsystematic reviewcompared the use of low-sodium salt substitutes to normal salt. The review found that these salt substitutes may lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure, both in people with normal and high blood pressure. Interestingly, the salt substitutes didn’t appear to lower the risk of new or existing hypertension or death. These findings are different from most other research, which has found that low-sodium salt substitutes have the most noticeable effect in people with high blood pressure. Why the difference? Some of the studies that looked at people with regular blood pressure in the more recent review were of poor quality, didn’t assess many people, and/or included people who were not representative of the general population. Therefore, currently, the authors only recommend low-sodium salt substitutes in people with high blood pressure. Overall, more research is needed to improve the evidence-base around low-sodium salt-substitutes (8). Despite their potential benefits, salt substitutes are not safe for everyone. Stomach issues, respiratory symptoms, and heart trouble are potential, albeit very rare, side effects that have been documented (1). Also, people who have difficultly eliminating potassium from their body—such as people who have kidney disease or are on potassium-sparing drugs—should speak with their health care provider before using salt substitutes. This is because salt substitutes that are high in potassium can cause a dangerous build-up of potassium in the body (13-14). So, should you ‘pass the salt-substitute’ or ‘pass on the salt-substitute’? Well, low-sodium salt substitutes are a readily-available option to help lower your sodium intake, and may even help reduce your blood pressure. But they may not be right for everyone. Before trading in salt for a salt substitute, make sure to speak with your health care provider. Some initial questions to ask include: 1) are salt substitutes a good option for me, 2) are there certain types of salt-substitutes that I should favour or avoid, and 3) are there instructions on how I should be using salt-substitutes? Don’t forget to read the ingredient list of any salt-substitute you want to use so you can assess how it can impact your health!""]"

Well, it’s true. The world has gone digital (1), and more and more people are picking up their smartphones to better manage their health. With chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, cancer, and lung disease accounting for over two-thirds of global deaths (2;3), the mobile health app market is keeping pace with the need to find ways to manage such diseases. Tackling nutrition—through education, counselling by registered dietitians, or changing the foods we eat (1;4-7)—is a tried and true approach to chronic disease prevention (2;8) and care (1;4-7). But in practice, people with chronic diseases face many daily hurdles that interfere with their ability to stay on top of their diet (1;9). Imagine that you’re an older adult living with heart disease. You’re scheduled to meet with a registered dietitian for nutritional counselling several times over the coming months. Each appointment will take 30-45 minutes, plus the one-hour bus ride that you must take to get there…and back. Amidst your busy schedule—and the bouts of dizziness and shortness of breath that come on at any time—you’re worried about your ability to keep these appointments. Clearly, managing a chronic illness is difficult. Issues like time, resources, and access can quickly derail even the most effective management strategies (1;9). The good news? Living in the digital age means there are a number of dietary\xa0mobile apps available that put nutritional help at our fingertips (2). But, with these apps obtainable at the ‘click of a button’, we must ask—do they work, and…are they safe? Arecentsystematic reviewfound that, in the short term, dietary\xa0mobile apps may help adults with chronic diseases lose weight, trim their waistline, and reduce their calorie consumption. The apps that led to these successful results allowed for self-monitoring—giving users the ability to track things like diet and exercise. Most of these apps also incorporated or were based on some form of behavioral change theory, and in some cases delivered counselling through the app. While dietary\xa0mobile apps currently appear to hold some promise, the review’s authors did make note of something very important—that many of these apps haven’t undergone rigorous testing to evaluate their effectiveness and safety before becoming publicly available (2). Therefore, consumers are encouraged to do their own homework to find out which apps are backed by good quality evidence that they are both safe and effective. Speaking with a health care provider about plans to add new tools to one’s chronic disease management strategy is also recommended.']"

Of those, 22.9% were between the age of 50 to 64, and 7.4% were 65 and over.(2) This situation highlights the importance of policies, programs and services aimed at reducing the harmful use of alcohol.Managed alcohol programs are a harm-reduction approach for people living with severe alcohol dependence who often experience homelessness or housing instability.(3; 4) The Canadian Mental Health Association defines harm reduction as ""an evidence-based, client-centred\xa0approach\xa0that seeks to\xa0reduce\xa0the health and social\xa0harms\xa0associated with addiction and substance use, without necessarily requiring people who use substances from abstaining or stopping.""(5) Individuals in managed alcohol programs have had multiple and repeated attempts at detox and treatment, and often experience large gaps in health and social services. Managed alcohol programs provide controlled access to alcohol (for example, regulated doses of wine, beer or sherry at predetermined times during the day) and replace dangerous non-beverage alcohol (for example, mouthwash, hand sanitizer and hairspray) for whom abstinence has not worked.(4) The primary focus of these programs is to reduce harms (for example, reduce antisocial behaviours, safely stabilize consumption and replace non-beverage alcohol with beverage alcohol).(6) The first managed alcohol program was created over 20 years ago in Toronto as a response to a coroner’s inquest that determined three homeless men froze to death after being turned away from shelters due to their alcohol dependence.(4) The number of managed alcoholprogramshas since increased significantly (23 programslocated in five provinces - British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Ontario). These programs are offered\xa0in a range of settings (shelters, supportive housing and hospitals) and for specific populations (chronically homeless, Indigenous peoples and older adults).Like other harm-reduction approaches (for example, supervised injection facilities for drugs users),\xa0managed alcohol programs raise questions among the public. By providing alcohol to chronic alcoholics, are we abandoning them or making the situation worse? Or is it a necessary evil in order to help manage their addiction and to keep them safe? A recent rapid synthesis conducted by the McMaster Health Forum examined the effectiveness of managed alcohol programs in supporting individuals with severe alcohol-related problems.(7) The synthesis revealed the limited body of research evidence on this topic. However, research is currently being conducted in the field by theCanadian Managed Alcohol Program studyat the University of Victoria. Nonetheless, the rapid synthesis found the following evidence supporting managed alcohol programs:1) decreased number of beverage alcohol consumed per day;2) increased safety and quality of life;3) lower incidence of alcohol-related harm;4) fewer police interactions;5) decreased emergency-department visits and hospital admissions;6) no significant individual or group-level differences in liver function tests; and7) potential cost savings (through reductions in spending on\xa0health care and emergency services). The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health have identified key signs of alcohol problems among older adults, including:- loss of co-ordination, falls and slurred speech;- problems sleeping;- poor personal care (for example, not bathing, not eating or not eating well, not taking care of health problems);- irritability, depression or confusion;- stomach problems, lack of desire to eat;- making excuses or making up stories to cover up drinking problems;- tension in relationships, losing touch with friends or family;- lack of interest in usual activities, desire to stay alone a lot of the time; and- signs of alcohol withdrawal (for example, racing pulse, tremors and agitation).(8) It is important to remember that these signs may be similar to medication problems.

That being said, there is a growing body of research evidence about the negative impact of extreme weather events to human health (and particularly to older adults).(3)Let's take heat waves as an example. Research evidence shows that older adults are more likely to be vulnerable, whether because of social factors such as social isolation, or physical factors such as chronic conditions (for example, cardiovascular disease, emphysema, asthma, kidney disease, neurological disease, hypertension, or diabetes), or a decreased ability to regulate their body temperature.(4) Is it possible to better support older adults to manage their health and well-being, especially during extreme weather events? Are there mobile apps combining information about their health status with information about the environment outside their home (for example, extreme temperatures, icy conditions, or poor air quality)? A recent systematic review examined 35 studies about the use of mobile apps for older adults to prevent and manage chronic conditions, as well as encouraging access to activities outside their home.(5) These mobile apps are computer programs or software applications designed to run on mobile devices such as smartphones or tablets.The review identified a broad range of mobile apps that can support self-management (for example, tracking information about their health, symptoms, medications, food and exercise), can help to conduct home tests and electronically communicate results to a health professional; can allow for continuous home monitoring,\xa0and can complete geriatric self-assessments.Yet, the review revealed some key limitations of the mobile apps studied. These apps have generally been developed to target a single health condition (for example, coronary artery disease, dementia, or type 2 diabetes), rather than taking a more holistic approach to health that considers the whole person and how he or she interacts with his or her environment. None of the identified mobile apps were designed to access information about the environment outside the homes of older adults.The authors of the review are encouraging the development of holistic mobile apps that can integrate information and data from multiple sources (including about older adults' health and their external environment). Such applications could help in the prevention and management of chronic diseases, and improving the health and well-being of older adults. For example, these apps could provide personalized warnings (and recommendations) based on the person's location, weather conditions and health status, using GPS coordinates and health data. This review reveals the unfinished potential of mobile apps. In a context where older adults have positive views towards technologies and are increasingly connected, mobile apps are likely to become increasingly popular. Findings from a recent survey commissioned by AGE-WELL, a federally funded Network of Centres of Excellence, and conducted by Environics Research, reveal that:- 74% of those aged 65+ and 80% of those aged 50-64 report feeling confident using current technology;- over 8 in 10 Canadians 65+ believe technological advancements can help older adults stay safe, independent and stay in their own homes longer;- 86% of Canadians aged 65+ and 94% of Canadians aged 50+ report being online daily; and- 58% of Canadians aged 65+ and almost 8 in 10 (78%) aged 50-64 own smartphones.(6) Yet, some providers argued that we need to be cautious. While mobile apps may hold great potential, they may also cause some people to feel unnecessary anxiety about their health.(7)""]"

At the same time, the latest research findings on causes, treatments, and prevention will continue to be highlighted in daily news headlines, the books we read, the newsletters we subscribe to, and our favourite TV shows and podcasts. Why the intense interest in such topics? Decliningcognitive function—things like memory, attention, awareness, reasoning, and judgement—is the leading cause of disability and death in older adults (1;2). But there may be ways to improvecognitive function(1;3;4). How? By taking advantage of the brain’s neuroplasticity (1). Neuroplasticity is the brain’s ability to change and make new connections when met with things like damage, defects, new information, stimulation, or development. This concept goes against past beliefs that the brain is “hard-wired”, with newer and emerging evidence demonstrating that the brain can, in fact, reorganize itself (5). Take, for example, physical exercise in the form of aerobic or strength training. In older adults, physical exercise has been shown to lead to changes in how the brain is connected and structured, as well as how it functions (1;6-8). Aside fromphysical activity,brain trainingmay also improvecognitive function. If both strategies can work on their own, does this mean that combining the two can lead to even greater rewards (1)? Arecentsystematic reviewfound that combining physical activity and brain training can improvecognitive functionin older adults, regardless of whether they have mild cognitive impairment or not. Here, physical activity included aerobic exercise, strength training, or both, while brain training included tasks that trained one or multiple areas ofcognitive function. Those exposed to a combination of physical and cognitive exercise benefited more than those taking part in usual care/doing nothing, or those doing physical activity alone. Interestingly, a combined physical and cognitive exercise program was not any better than doing brain training on its own. However, this finding shouldn’t encourage people to drop physical exercise from their strategy to stay cognitively healthy; because the benefits of exercise stretch far beyond brain health to include physical, mental, and social health as well. Rather, these findings should motivate people to add brain training to their new or existing physical activity routines. The review also looked at whether the nature of the combined program—things like the length of the program or duration and frequency of training sessions—mattered. Apparently, the answer is…not so much. Short (<12 weeks), medium (12-13 weeks), and long (≥ 24 weeks) programs were all helpful, as were low (1 times/week), medium (2 times/week), and high (≥3 times/week) frequency training sessions. Sessions of short (≤ 45 min) and medium (> 45 to ≤60 min) duration also produced gains, whereas long (>60 min) sessions didn’t (although there wasn’t a huge difference between the three groups). Because the evidence base is sparse, more research is needed to understand how these factors interact with each other. Instead, what may seem to matter more with these combined programs is whether physical activity and brain training are done at different times—such as one after another—or simultaneously, through activities like tai chi, dance, martial arts, or video games that involve exercise. Here, the latter—so doing brain and physical training simultaneously—showed the potential to be more effective. While this combined strategy is promising, further research will need to explore how well this approach works over the long-term (1). Hoping to stay sharp as you age? Exercising both your body and your brain together can help!']"

They are leaving their hospital routines and their hospital-based care team (which may include doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, mental health workers, dietitians, and volunteers). They will need to establish new routines to manage their own health and care back home. This may include using a new medication or treatment, or working with a different care team.(1)A recent systematic review examined older adults’ experiences of adapting to daily life after going back home from hospital.(2) The review revealed that older adults often experienced an insecure or unsafe transition (for example, experiencing a rushed discharge, being confused about medication and how to take it, not understanding the information provided to them, lacking coordination and communication between providers, conflicting opinions between providers), and had difficulty settling into their new situation at home (for example, losing independence, home not being prepared, having problems performing daily activities, feeling lonely and isolated).Hospital-to-home transitions can be particularly stressful for older adults with complex health and social needs (and for their caregivers too). It is increasingly common for older adults to have multiple chronic conditions. Many are also living with a mental health conditions (anxiety, depression, and Alzheimer’s and other dementias). These older adults are at increased risk for poor quality of life and poor health outcomes, particularly when they are transitioning from hospital to home.(3) They will typically receive fragmented care from multiple care providers who often lack a common system for coordination and communication.(4; 5)In addition, many older adults with complex health needs live in complex social circumstances. They may be financially insecure, lonely, geographically isolated, in inadequate and unaffordable housing, have limited ability to use health information, and may be are unaware of care and other supportive services in their community.(6) All these factors may negatively affect their transition from hospital-to-home.Carefully planning and supporting hospital-to-home transitions is so important. Quality transitions from hospital to home result in a number of positive outcomes, including:- reduced length of stay at the hospital;(7)- reduced hospital readmissions;(7-9)- increased use of primary-care services that could help to prevent health problems;(8)- reduced use of unnecessary home-care services;(8)- reduced admission to long-term care homes;(10) and- better health outcomes and quality of life.(11) However, poorly planned and supported transitions pose serious safety risks to older adults, lead to complications and hospital readmissions, and put an added strain on older adults, their caregivers and the entire health system.(12; 13) Make sure that you (or your caregiver) play an active role in planning your transition back home. Concrete tools could help you engage in conversations with the hospital-based care team (for example, thePatient Conversation Guidebeing developed by Health Quality Ontario). Hospital-based care team are increasingly using tools to provide clear instructions to know how to manage at home once discharged (for example, thePatient-Oriented Discharge Summaryused in 27 hospitals across Ontario).The content of this blog post is based on a citizen brief prepared by the McMaster Health Forum: Gauvin FP, Gannan R, Heald-Taylor G, Markle-Reid M, McAiney C, Moat KA, Lavis JN.

Find out which types of nicotine replacement therapy work best,"['Finding reasons to quit smoking is not difficult. Tobacco use—a major risk factor for cancer, diabetes, heart problems, and eye problems, to name a few—is the leading cause of illness and death worldwide (1-3). But despite the clear-cut benefits of quitting, many smokers struggle to break their physical and mental dependence on smoking (2;4). This is where nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) can help! NRT works by replacing the nicotine in cigarettes with other sources of nicotine, eliminating exposure to the harmful ingredients found in tobacco (2;5) and the dangers that come along with inhaling toxic cigarette smoke (6). From gums to sprays to patches, NRT comes in many different forms. Some of these NRT options include: Long-acting NRTs: Fast-acting NRTs: We already know thatnicotine replacement therapy can help people quit smoking, but with so many varieties to choose from, which approach works best? Arecentsystematic reviewfound that some NRT strategies may work better than others in smokers (generally adults) who want to quit and who smoke at least 15 cigarettes a day. Three conclusive findings emerged from this review. First, fast-acting NRTs (such as gums or lozenges) are equally as effective as long-acting NRTs (such as patches) in helping people quit smoking. Second, combining a fast-acting NRT with a long-acting NRT is more effective than using just one type of NRT. Finally, gum that contains a higher dose of nicotine (4 mg) works better than gum containing a lower dose of nicotine (2 mg), but effectiveness may vary depending on the person’s level of nicotine dependence. The findings also suggest that higher doses of nicotine in nicotine patches (42/44 mg patch worn for 24-hours) are not more effective than moderate doses (21/22 mg patch worn for 24-hours) in helping people quit smoking, but that moderate doses are more effective than low doses (14 mg patch worn for 24-hours). However, due to some limitations in how these studies were conducted, more research is needed to prove if this is really true. Now, you’re probably wondering whether when you start using NRT matters. Interestingly, it turns out the answer is…maybe, with evidence showing that beginning before your designated “quit day” might increase your chances of success, compared to starting on your “quit day”. This finding does need to be looked into further before it’s confirmed. Side effects are likely another worry. While most doctors agree that NRT is generally safe and well-tolerated, not many studies in the review adequately reported on safety. This means more research is needed to understand how the side effects of different NRTs stack up (2). If it’s quitting time for you, there are a number of effective NRTs to choose from. Consider your goals, preferences, safety, and tolerability of different products when making your decision. Seeking advice from a health care professional is also always a great place to start!']"

An estimated 50 million people worldwide are living with dementia, and this number is expected to triple to 152 million by 2050. In Canada alone, more than 402,000 people aged 65 and over have dementia. In addition to memory loss, older adults with dementia can no longer perform daily living activities or take care of themselves, and can demonstrate challenging behaviours.Many of these people live in residential and long-term care facilities, but others are still living at home with support from their caregivers. Caregiver burden can take a toll. These caregivers often experience very complex and painful moments. Studies revealed that they have to assume new complex roles and responsibilities, cope with challenging behaviours associated with dementia, and often feel isolated.(1; 2; 3)Services exist to support them, including respite services. Several types of respite services exist in Canada, including respite services at home or outside the home (for example, day centres or facilities where people with dementia can be admitted for a few days or weeks) . (4)Despite the burden and distress of these caregivers, many do not use existing respite services.(5) What can explain this situation? A systematic review examined 14 studies to identify factors associated with not using different types of respite services, and identify ways to better meet the needs of caregivers and people living with dementia.(6) Several factors were identified, including demographic characteristics, health beliefs, and personal and community factors.Demographic characteristicsIf the caregiver is also the spouse of the person with dementia, it is associated with a reduced use of day-care respite services. As for respite services at home, it seems that women over the age of 70 who act as caregivers are less likely to benefit from these services. Although research findings are mixed, studies show that belonging to an ethnic minority appears to influence the type of services used.Health beliefsAttitudes towards respite services and other beliefs can influence caregivers. If they do not consider these services useful, they will not use them. If they believe that helping their loved ones as their duty, they are less likely to use day-care respite services.Personal and community factorsUse of respite services outside the home may be low if they are difficult to access. Services must be provided where people live and work, and be easily accessible (whenever possible reducing the burden of transportation and wait times).Caregivers should also be made aware of existing services in their community and how to access them. They must also have the financial resources to enable them to use the services. Studies show that caregivers with low income or living in low-density areas were less likely to us respite services (especially at home). This review highlights the importance of assessing the needs of people living with dementia and their caregivers to target the services they need.Whenever you are in contact with the health and social services system (for example, when your loved one is about to return home from hospital), do not hesitate to ask questions about respite services and other supports available in your community. Aguidelike the one prepared by Health Quality Ontario can help you have such conversations.']"
134,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2019/10/17/preventing-heart-attacks-is-aspirin-a-safe-choice,16 October 2019,Preventing heart attacks: Is aspirin a safe choice?,"['You’ve probably heard that taking a daily dose of aspirin can lower your risk of heart attack (1-7). With about 20% of older adults taking aspirin as a preventative strategy (8;9), there is no question that it is commonly prescribed. But do its benefits outweigh its risks? This has been a matter of controversy (8), especially when it comes to healthy adults. Why prescribe aspirin to prevent heart attacks? Aspirin (or acetylsalicylic acid) prevents blood clots (1). Blood clotting occurs when cells called platelets clump together and seal up a bleeding wound. Because blood clots that block the flow of blood to the heart can lead to a heart attack, stopping this process lowers your risk of a heart attack. What’s the catch? Because taking aspirin can make it difficult to form blood clots, it also increases the risk of internal bleeding (1;2;8;10). So, is aspirin a safe choice for heart attack prevention when both the benefits and risks are considered together? This is a matter of hot debate. Some guidelines recommend it for people at a higher risk for heart attack (8;11;12), whereas other guidelines don’t recommend it at all (8;13). And while there is research that supports its use in people with a history of heart attack or stroke, (8;11;12), evidence supporting its use in healthy adults is less clear (8;14;15). Given all of the conflicting evidence and guidelines,a recentsystematic reviewtook a closer look at the benefits and risks of aspirin use in adults with no history of heart disease—including outcomes such as stroke, heart attacks, blood clots in the legs, and so on (8). So, just what did this review find? The results showed that taking aspirin didn’t lower the risk of death from any cause in adults without a history of heart disease, compared to those takingplaceboor nothing at all. These findings held true even when considering people’s risk of major cardiovascular events, if they had diabetes or not, and the dose of aspirin they were taking (in most cases, people were taking 75 mg to 100 mg per day). What’s more, aspirin didn’t reduce the risk of death from heart disease-related complications or the risk of stroke. With respect to having a heart attack, the results varied across studies; but even in the best case scenario heart attacks were slightly less common in adults taking aspirin—about 3 fewer people out of 1000 having a heart attack. That being said, when older studies were removed from the analysis and only newer studies considered, no reduction in heart attacks among those taking aspirin was seen. In terms of negative side effects, those taking aspirin were more likely to experience major bleeding—including bleeding inside the brain or skull. So, in people with no history of heart disease, aspirin may do more harm than good. But, before tossing your bottle of aspirin from your medicine cabinet, make sure to talk to your health care provider about its potential risks and benefits for you as an individual (8). Folks should also keep in mind that the findings discussed here are for adults whodo nothave a history of heart disease, and sodo notapply to those with a history of heart disease or stroke.']"

Six Canadians are infected with HIV each day. Approximately one in seven of those infected with HIV are not aware of their infection.(1; 2)A greater number of older adults are now living with HIV. Key reasons for this are the improved treatment options that are available and that more people are receiving an HIV diagnosis later in life.(3) However, life expectancy for people living with HIV still lags behind that of people without HIV.(4; 5; 6; 7)Since there are now more older adults living with HIV, there are also more HIV-positive individuals with multiple chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer.(8; 9; 10; 11) The association between aging and chronic condition is well known. However, this association is stronger among people living with HIV.(12) This is due to the effects of long-term antiretroviral therapy (known as 'ART'). It is also driven by the negative impact of factors related to the social determinants of health (for example, income, housing, social status, social safety network) that also have an impact on health.(13) This means that the number of people who need complex care and who are living with different disabilities is increasing. As a result, HIV is increasingly seen as a complex condition, which requires better coordinated services that are able to address this complexity. Addressing the shift in the age profile of people living with HIV will require a comprehensive strategy, including: 1. new models of care that are sensitive to the unique needs of the increasing number of older adults living with HIV (including integration with long-term care settings);2. greater efforts towards addressing\xa0HIV-related stigma and discrimination (knowing that HIV primarily affects groups that are often the most stigmatized or marginalized in society: 49% of people living with HIV are gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men, 15% are people who inject drugs, and just under 10% are Indigenous);(14; 15) and3. greater prevention efforts targeting older adults (such efforts are challenging since knowledge of HIV and uptake of testing among Canadians over 50 is still low).(16) Change can start with you.

Take for example Canada. One in four Canadians aged 85 and over have been diagnosed with the condition, with the number of people diagnosed more than doubling every five years (1). Worldwide, about 50 million people suffer from dementia, costing more than $948 billion annually (2;3). Based on these stats, it’s no surprise that preventing dementia is top-of-mind for people, informal caregivers, health care providers, and policymakers alike. Dementia—which is most commonly caused by Alzheimer’s disease (4-6)—is a decline in cognitive ability (4). It affects things like memory, understanding, language, and problem solving skills. Dementia gets worse over time and can significantly impact quality of life and a person’s ability to carry out everyday activities (4). Before a person has dementia, they might experience Mild Cognitive Impairment, also known as MCI (4). In a person who has MCI, cognitive changes go beyond what is expected with aging, but daily functioning is not severely affected (4). For example, when MCI is present, changes in memory, judgement, and thinking can lead to increasing forgetfulness, greater impulsivity, and getting sidetracked when speaking or reading (7). However, these changes are not severe enough to interrupt one’s ability to complete daily routine activities (4). It is now known that the changes that lead to dementia or MCI begin long before symptoms appear (4;8), which provides an opportunity to prevent the onset of the disease. One popular idea is that vitamins or minerals (or both) can ward off cognitive decline. Vitamins and minerals are needed to keep the body running smoothly (4;9), and can be found naturally in the foods we eat or purchased as over-the-counter supplements (4;10). Over-the-counter supplements are a booming business, with consumers spending billions of dollars on them every year. But, when it comes to dementia prevention, are they worth the money? Onesystematic reviewcompared people taking vitamins or minerals—specifically vitamins A, B, C, D, and E, beta-carotene, calcium, zinc, copper, folic acid, selenium, and multivitamins—to people who did not. This review found no evidence that taking vitamins or minerals prevented dementia or cognitive decline among middle-aged or older adults with no signs of existing cognitive decline. Although some studies in the review found that vitamin C and beta-carotene may lead to better overall cognition when taken over the long-term (for 5 to 18 years), because these studies were of low-quality, it’s not clear if the results are trustworthy (4). Anothersystematic reviewlooked at over-the-counter supplements—specifically vitamins B, C, D, E, beta-carotene, omega-3 fatty acids, gingko biloba soy, folate, calcium, and multivitamins—and found similar results, that currently there is not enough evidence to support the use of over-the-counter supplements to prevent cognitive decline. This was found for both adults with normal cognition, as well as those with MCI. It’s also worth mentioning that two of the studies in this review showed that folic acid and vitamin B12 might improve memory when taken for two years, but again, the studies were of low-quality (9). So, where does this leave us? While the current research shows that vitamins and minerals may not prevent cognitive decline or dementia, hope is not lost. Research has revealed that exercise—for both yourbodyand yourbrain—may help improvecognitive function.']"

In 2015, all United Nations Member States adopted the2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.(3) This agenda provides a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for the world. It builds on 17 Sustainable Development Goals (also referred to as SDGs and listed in the figure below), which are an urgent call for action by all countries (both developed and developing) in a global partnership. The SDGs recognize that ending poverty, hunger and other deprivations must go hand-in-hand with strategies that improve health and education, reduce inequalities, and spur economic growth – all while tackling climate change and working to preserve our natural resources.(4)As part of the 2030 Agenda, there is a pledge to “leave no one behind.”(3) This means that we must include all persons, of all ages, with a particular focus on the most vulnerable – including older adults. It also emphasizes the importance of human dignity across the life course. TheStakeholder Group on Ageing(an international coalition serving as the voice of older adults at the global level) reminds us of the importance of including ageing issues (and engaging older adults) in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. Too often, older adults are invisible to those who promote economic and social development, or are perceived as passive recipients of care and services. Older adults are valuable assets that can use their experience, knowledge and skills to transform our world. The world is facing daunting challenges. Addressing those will be complex and will require the commitment of everyone (from individuals to world leaders). A recent systematic review highlighted that, while some progress has been made in implementing the SDGs, many countries are still pursuing siloed or piecemeal approaches to sustainable development that have been met with limited success in the past.(5) This means that we need comprehensive approaches to implement the SDGs, and consider how the SDGs are linked together.But change can start with you: LEARN:Learn more about the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (see video).

Early on, it's often symptomless. In its later stages, symptoms such as abdominal bloating, weight loss, pelvic pain, constipation, or frequent trips to the washroom can mimic those of more common, and potentially less serious conditions (1;2). In over half of women, ovarian cancer is not diagnosed until it has spread to other parts of the body (3-6). This makes it more difficult to treat. Roughly one-third of women with late stage ovarian cancer will still be alive five years after their diagnosis (5;7), and among the 80% of women who initially respond to treatment, the cancer will return in 70% of them (5;8). Therefore, it’s important to know your risk. Being over the age of 50, having certain gene mutations or a family history of ovarian cancer, or using estrogen replacement therapy may put you at higher risk, as does starting menstruation early or entering menopause late (2). Catching ovarian cancer early can improve your chances of beating the disease. The problem is that previous research has shown that ovarian cancer screening does not work well in symptomless women, and may even be harmful (3). In some cases, women who underwent screening were incorrectly given the all-clear, while other women were told they had cancer when they did not (3;9-11). In 2012, the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommended against screening for ovarian cancer in this population of women (3). Since then, more research has emerged, prompting the USPSTF to undertake anewsystematic reviewof the evidence around ovarian cancer screening in women who are over the age of 45, symptomless, and at “average risk” of the disease (that is, they have no family history of ovarian or breast cancer, or other high-risk cancers). They looked at ovarian cancer screening that was carried out by transvaginal ultrasound (an imaging test of the ovaries) and/or by a blood test (1;3). So, does the new evidence change the previous recommendation? The review found that ovarian cancer screening, compared to no screening, does not lower the number of deaths from ovarian cancer. False-positive test results (when women tested positive for cancer but did not have the disease) also resulted in unnecessary surgeries (3). Based on these findings, in 2018, the USPSTF recommended against ovarian cancer screening in women with an “average risk” of ovarian cancer who do not have symptoms (1), a recommendation that is supported by the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care (12). The Canadian Cancer Society also recommends that women at higher risk of ovarian cancer speak with their doctor to develop a personal plan for ovarian cancer screening (13). As always, you should speak with your health care provider about the pros and cons of ovarian cancer screening, and whether it is a good choice based on your own health, risk factors, and preferences. You should also speak with your health care provider if you have concerning symptoms.""]"

The arts can enable such introspection, whether it's\xa0painting, sculpture, literature, music, theatre or cinema.\xa0We feel the urge to try new things, but also to leave our mark and find meaning in our lives. It is well known that the arts help to improve social engagement and well-being among older adults, and can reduce certain health problems such as hypertension, anxiety and depressive symptoms.(1; 2; 3) Social movements, but also programs and policies, have emerged to increase participation in art therapy, and to provide artistic activities designed to foster social interaction.(2) Could we also use the arts to share information and knowledge related to aging? Can the arts change the negative perceptions of health professionals or the general public towards aging (or towards older adults suffering from debilitating illnesses, like dementia)? A recent systematic review examined 11 scientific articles to understand how the arts are used to raise awareness about different phenomena associated with aging, including dementia, the lives of centenarians, widowhood, social isolation, chronic diseases, and frailty.(4) All the artistic approaches studied in these articles have incorporated a narrative component, most often through theater. The review revealed that the arts have great potential to inform the public, researchers and health professionals about aging-related issues. Professionals and researchers could use the arts to identify the problems that older adults face and solutions to address them (for example, plays triggering discussions\xa0between actors, the public and professionals about aging-related problems, like the risks and consequences of falls). The arts could also be used to share knowledge, change attitudes and behaviors, or combat ageism (for example, creating literary and visual works depicting the lived experiences of centenarians, or highlighting the negative perceptions that some professionals and the public may have towards older adults suffering from debilitating illnesses). In many studies, life stories (particularly in theater) are frequently used to discuss health issues, social isolation, illness, and life experiences related to aging. Theater appears particularly promising, given\xa0its capacity to share clear key messages based on action, interaction and reaction to life events. The studies also indicate that such stories can be used to share research evidence with the public and professionals, or to raise awareness and change attitudes. Studies that have examined the used of arts in the context of older adults living with dementia (and their caregivers) have found that sharing stories and life experiences offers a real collaborative exchange that everyone can benefit from. The arts should not be seen as a mere form of recreational activities. It is possible to take advantage of the arts to improve well-being, of course, but also to share information and knowledge in order to promote healthy aging. Let’s encourage older adults, caregivers, professionals and researchers express themselves creatively and artistically about aging-related issues.""]"

So, your heart may quiver and flutter, but not in a good way. If you suffer from Afib, you’re not alone. Afib is the most common type of abnormal heart rhythm in adults (2-6), affecting 350,000 Canadians (7) and around 1 in 4 adults aged 40 years old and over (3;8). As the world’s population ages, this condition is expected to become even more commonplace (3;9-11). During Afib, the heart often beats faster than normal, with the top half of the heart beating out of sync with the bottom half (1). This means that blood doesn’t move in and out of your heart as it should. Although Afib is usually not life-threatening, it sometimes requires emergency medical treatment (1-3;12). It can also lead to complications—people with Afib are at higher risk of stroke and potentially dangerous blood clots deep in the veins or lungs. This increased risk is thought to occur because of changes in blood flow, blood composition, or the blood vessel walls (3;13). People with Afib are often treated with “blood thinners” to reduce the chance that they will develop a blood clot. Older types of blood thinners include aspirin, as well as vitamin K antagonists such aswarfarin. Newer to the arsenal are non-vitamin K antagonists (NOACs), includingdabigatran,rivaroxaban,apixaban, andedoxaban(2;14). Each of type of blood thinner has their own risks and benefits. But, which ones work best to prevent stroke and blood clots and how safe are they? Arecentsystematic reviewexplored the evidence (2;3). Overall, the review found thatwarfarincan reduce the risk of stroke/blockage of blood vessels by blood clots and death in people aged 65 years old and over with Afib, compared with aspirin or no treatment. What’s more, there was no increased risk of major bleeding. Older adults taking the newer NOACs seemed to fare even better than those takingwarfarin. As a group, NOACs were associated with a lower risk of stroke and blood clots, as well as a reduced risk of major bleeding (2;3) and death (2), compared towarfarin. That said, these findings may differ depending on the person and NOAC that is used—while some NOACs were superior, others were on par withwarfarinin terms of stroke/blood clots and major bleeding (2). An important consideration to keep in mind when it comes to NOACs, is that they may not be for everyone. As with any medication, factors such as your health status, other medications you take, and more play a role in what your health care provider is able to prescribe. Price is also a factor, as NOACs tend to be more expensive thanwarfarin. Although Afib can send your heartbeat into temporary chaos, this chaos doesn’t need to wreak havoc on your life. Newer blood thinners may be a safer and more effective way to ease your fluttering heart and the complications it brings. Speak with your health care provider about which treatment option is best for you,\xa0and before making any changes to your medications.']"

These older adults rely heavily on informal and family caregivers to support them.\xa0The job of a caregiver can be an emotional rollercoaster and they often require much needed breaks. As for the older adults, they may be at greater risk of becoming socially isolated, and may require safe and stimulating environments that could help to maintain their autonomy.(1; 2)Many older adults and caregivers are benefiting from day centres, which offer programs of activities in professional care settings. These activities are designed for older adults who require supervised care during the day, or those who are lonely or socially isolated. Day centres enable older adults to socialize and enjoy planned activities among a group of older adults, while still receiving needed health and social services. In doing so, day centres also offer informal and family caregivers respite from caregiving duties while knowing that their loved ones are in a safe and stimulating environment.(3)But what does research tell us about these day centres? A recent scoping review examined 77 English-language studies published between 2005 and 2017 on how day centres are perceived, their benefits and their purposes.(4) Of note, the review focused on ""general"" day centres and thus excluded studies of day centres exclusively for older adults with dementia, or for those receiving palliative care or end-of-life care. What are the purposes of day centres?The review identified four main purposes of day centres: 1. Providing social and preventive services By offering these types of services, day centres aim to:- promote the maintenance of physical, psychological and social capacities (older adults attending day centres feeling more stimulated and confident and are more likely to pursue social activities outside day centres);- develop a support network for older adults (and thus encourage them to continue to attend day centres);- improve their mental health (less depression and anxiety) or prevent the decline of their mental health; and- provide access to other services, such as occupational therapy, nutrition or screening services for example. The studies identified in this scoping review revealed a diversity of programs offered in day centres aiming to provide social and preventive services, including: programs based on humor; transportation, exercise and self-help programs; organized volunteer programs; psycho-social group work; group discussions to promote social engagement and learning; health awareness programs; or auditory and visual screening programs. 2. Supporting independenceIt seems that attending day centers delays the time when long-term care is needed. By allowing older adults to maintain their functions longer, it allows them to stay longer at home.The studies revealed many programs offered at day centres to support the independence of older adults, including: moderate intensity exercise programs aimed at improving stability and flexibility, and fall prevention programs. 3. Supporting health and daily living needsThe studies identified a multitude of programs offered at day centres to support health and daily living needs, including: blood pressure monitoring programs offered by nurses (sometimes via a telehealth kiosk); self-management education programs; or medicine review programs offered by pharmacy students. Research evidence shows that, in day centres with exercises and nutritional programs, older adults experienced fewer falls and reported better overall health. 4. Providing respite to caregiversLastly, another key purpose of day centres is to provide respite to caregivers. Research evidence suggests that caregivers of older adults who attend day centres may have a better psychological quality of life than others. Who benefits from day centers?Older adults\xa0who are socially isolated and lack support networks seem to be more likely to visit day centres. Research evidence shows that these are mainly elderly women living alone or who are widowed, divorced or single, low-income, who have different health issues and who take multiple medicines.How are day centres perceived?Although they are recognized in the continuum of care in many countries, day centres are not always fully recognized by health professionals. Some studies found that managers of day centres felt that the terms used to describe their services (for example, ""day care centres"") could contribute to the stigmatization of day centre clients as being disabled and very old. In addition, these managers had the impression that health professionals do not understand the added value of day centres.As for older adults, they have mixed perceptions of day centres. Some of them do not want to define themselves as old, isolated, sick or unhappy, and are thus reluctant to use services offered in day centres. Others view day centres much more positively as community places to practice different activities and to socialize. Canadian studies show that day centers seem to be part of our culture and are quite well recognized and respected by their clients. There may be many day centres out there. While some of these day centres are providing services to older adults with a wide range of health and social needs, others are dedicated to older adults suffering from specific conditions (for example, Alzheimer\'s disease and related forms of dementia) or receiving certain types of care (for example, palliative care or end-of-life care).Before deciding if a day centre is right for you (or your loved ones):- discuss with your health and social care providers to identify your needs, and to identify a day centre that could respond to them;- check the websites of your ministry of health, your regional health authority, or disease-specific organizations (for example, the Alzheimer Society of Canada) for any listing of existing and recognized day centres near you; and- plan to visit at least three day centres (if possible) so that you can meet the personnel, ask all your questions, and get a general feeling of the environment of each day centre.']"

Invest in the right ones and you may see gains in your heart health. Heart disease is an umbrella term for diseases that affect the heart and blood vessels (1;2). These diseases most often result from the narrowing and blockage of arteries by plaque deposits, and this is often caused by high cholesterol (1;3). Luckily, healthy lifestyle choices—like diet modifications—are a good way to combat heart disease (4;5). Enter the Portfolio diet—a plant-based diet that is made up of four core foods: ≥ 45 grams of nuts, ≥ 50 grams of plant protein from soy or beans, ≥ 22 grams of viscous fibre from things like oats, eggplant, apples, or barley, and 2 grams of plant-sterols from items like plant-sterol-enriched margarine (6). The premise of this diet is simple: grouping foods that have their own cholesterol-lowering ability when eaten alone will have a larger effect when there are combined into a “portfolio” as part of a regular diet. Preliminary research supports this idea (6-12), with the diet’s benefits being recognized by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society, Diabetes Canada, and other world renowned experts in heart disease and diabetes (6;13-14). While the Portfolio diet is backed by emerging evidence, arecentsystematic reviewtook a closer look to find out if this diet provides a good return on investment for one particular group of people: those who are overweight and have high cholesterol, but have not yet developed heart disease or diabetes. In this review, people started out on a low-fat National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP Step II) diet, where ≤30% of their energy came from total fat, <7% of their energy came from saturated fat, and they consumed <200 milligrams of cholesterol per day. They then switched from an NCEP Step II diet to a version of the Portfolio diet or to receiving nutritional advice encouraging the consumption of foods within the Portfolio diet (6). The current evidence is encouraging! The review found that, compared with people who followed the NCEP Step II diet alone, people who followed the combination of a Portfolio diet and NCEP Step II diet lowered multiple risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. “Bad” LDL cholesterol and other fats found in the blood such as non-HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were all reduced, as were inflammation and blood pressure. Even better, this was accompanied by a reduction in the ten-year risk of coronary heart disease. In contrast, the Portfolio diet did not have any effect on weight or “Good” HDL cholesterol. Although promising, larger, high-quality studies are needed to confirm that these beneficial findings translate into real improvements in heart health (6). Struggling to keep your cholesterol levels under control? The Portfolio diet may be a good way to manage your cardiovascular risk.']"
143,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2019/08/14/empowering-caregivers,14 August 2019,Empowering caregivers,"['Canada, like most high-income countries, is experiencing an aging population, with those over 65 being on track to represent 25% of the Canadian population by 2050. This shift in population demographics is requiring significant changes in the delivery of health and social services including an increased focus on helping individuals to age well at home. Canadians have thus been called on to provide a significant amount of caregiving to their friends and families. A pan-Canadian study from 2012 show that each day bout 28% of Canadians provide care for a family member, friend or neighbour, and that approximately half of Canadians will do so over the course of their lifespan.(1)Despite their critical roles, caregivers often feel unprepared to provide care and often receive little guidance from healthcare providers. How can we empower them so that they can have the confidence to deliver care to their loved ones? A recent rapid synthesis examined 27 systematic reviews and 15 primary studies to identify the knowledge, skills, attitudes, behaviours and resources required to empower caregivers.(2)Research evidence reveal that caregivers need to be empowered with disease-specific knowledge for them to understand the health conditions and how to manage symptoms, plan for future decisions, make timely decisions about preferences for future health and personal care, maintain community connection, and access peer support. Research evidence also emphasizes other key knowledge required to empower caregivers, including knowledge of care transitions (for example, how to manage the transition from hospital to home), community services available, as well as knowledge about the health system more generally and the roles of the various healthcare providers.In terms of required skills, research evidence emphasizes the importance of caregiving skills such as how to provide personal care and rehabilitation care. Coping skills, problem-solving skills, communication skills, and note-taking skills have also been identified as critical to empower caregivers. Research focusing on caregivers of older adults with dementia also highlights the need to develop caregiving skills in order to deal with people who may be confused, incontinent and depressed.There is limited research evidence about the attitudes and behaviours needed by caregivers. With regards to attitudes, research evidence indicates the importance of cultivating positive attitudes towards people with dementia (since people with dementia may exhibit\xa0behaviours that make their care more challenging and can disrupt the lives of\xa0caregivers and others at home). In addition,research evidence shows that caregivers often have difficulties working in an unrecognized role without adequate financial, informational or educational resources to support them. In particular, caregivers often grapple with constantly changing roles, grasping medical knowledge, emotional stress, financial strains, and changing family dynamics. Thus, caregivers need greater affirmation and validation of their roles to really feel empowered. If you feel the need to be more empowered to provide care to your loved ones, some strategies could help you, such as:- using structured information tools (for example, patient decision aids) and sharing life stories can help to improve communication and shared decision-making between patients, caregivers and healthcare providers;(3)- interventions to improve coping and problem-solving skills can help to support caregivers’ well-being and reduce the number of problems they experience;(4; 5)- mindfulness training can reduce depression, anxiety and burden, as well as increased quality of life, hope and overall mental health of caregivers;(6)- web- and computer-mediated programs can be as effective as face-to-face interventions to deliver information, education, training, and psychosocial and behavioural supports to caregivers;(7) and- peer helpers can provide caregivers with greater affirmation and validation of their roles.(8) The content of this blog post is based on arapid synthesisprepared by the McMaster Health Forum on empowering caregivers to deliver home-based restorative care.']"

Such participation can also help people keep a healthy, active and engaged life. These benefits can be observed in older adults, civic participation allowing them to build relationships, reduce loneliness and social isolation, but also improve their health and quality of life.(1) But what else is known about the different forms of civic participation? A recent systematic review examined 429 studies published over the last five decades about the civic participation of older adults.(2) This review made several key observations: Individual and collective forms of participationCivic participation includes individual activities (also referred as private or informal participation) or within a group or organization (referred as collective, public or formal participation). For example, someone could help individuals in their neighborhood (an individual form of participation), or sit on the board of a community organization (a collective form of participation).From participation to engagementCivic participation aims to help others, solve community problems, or produce a common good, without necessarily having political intentions. Such participation conveys the idea of social action, such as helping friends and neighbors, donating to a charity or organization, or volunteering for a community organization.Research shows that civic participation can also lead to engagement which is more political. The difference between the terms “participation” and “engagement” may seem trivial. However, engagement reflects a deliberate attention to social and political issues. Thus, some older adults may defend a cause, vote, contact their elected officials, sign petitions, write letters or blog posts on pressing health and social issues, stand for public office, or participate in events and social movements.Still limited research on the civic participation of older adultsDespite the diversity of forms of civic participation, research conducted in the past five decades has focused on collective forms of civic participation of older adults, particularly volunteering. Other forms of participation (and engagement) have thus been largely neglected in research.In addition, research on civic participation has also neglected to provide a diverse portray of older adults. In fact, older adults who actively participate in their community are far from forming a homogeneous group. They have very different characteristics, in terms of gender, the expected civic roles for men and women, ethno-cultural background, health status, age, socio-economic status, or core values. All of these factors can influence the civic participation of older adults. Organizations in your community surely need you. Civic participation (especially volunteering) seems to be the key to meeting the needs of older adults in terms of proximity, meaningful relationships and reciprocity.(1)But beyond volunteering, you can also be an agent of change by defending a social, environmental, or political cause. Make your voice heard in order to influence decision-making processes. Consider becoming familiar with social media and other online platforms. These are increasingly used for public debates and consultations.(3)']"

Although it can be frustrating and stressful, it’s not an unusual occurrence. In fact, about one in three men will experience premature ejaculation at some point in their life, making it the most common sexual disorder in males (1;2-4). Premature ejaculation is when a man experiences ejaculation before they wish to, with very little sexual stimulation (1;5-6). It can occur before, at the time of, or shortly after penetration. Not only does premature ejaculation put a damper on sexual satisfaction—it can also take a toll on relationships and quality of life (1;7-8). This condition can affect a man at any age, and no one knows why it happens. For some, it’s a lifelong problem, whereas for others it may creep up later in life (1;9-10). The bottom line is that health, not age, is a key factor that affects a person’s sexuality, and premature ejaculation is one condition that can play a role (11). Although there is no cure for premature ejaculation, there is hope. From behavioural techniques to creams, sprays, medications, acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, and delay devices, there are plenty of treatment options available to help.Onesystematic reviewexplored the pros and cons of each (1). Overall, the findings of the review were promising! Many of the treatments showed that they have the potential to increase the time from vaginal penetration to ejaculation by 1 to 6 minutes, and improve sexual satisfaction. But, just which treatments worked for each outcome, and what side effects need to be considered? Well, behavioural therapy was one treatment that increased both time to ejaculation and improved sexual satisfaction, without any negative side effects. A huge number of drugs were also tested, including opioid-based painkillers (tramadol), anti-depressants (citalopram,escitalopram,fluoxetine,paroxetine,sertraline,fluvoxamine,dapoxetine,duloxetine, andclomipramine), drugs for erectile dysfunction (vardenafil,tadalafil, andsildenafil), and drugs used to treat high blood pressure (terazosin). All of these drugs were found to be effective in increasing time to ejaculation, except forfluvoxamineandsildenafil. Some also appeared to assist with improving sexual satisfaction—includingcitalopram,paroxetine,dapoxetine,tramadol, and erectile dysfunction drugs. However, despite these desired benefits, many drugs were associated with side effects like nausea, dry mouth, headache, dizziness, nose irritation, flushing, palpitations, low blood pressure, and drowsiness. What’s more, it turns out that behavioral therapy and medication may be a ‘dynamic duo’, with reports that their combined use could provide greater benefits than using either alone. For those looking for non-drug options outside of behavioral therapies, time to ejaculation may also be improved by anesthetic creams and sprays, delay devices (e.g., numbing band with a stop–start technique), acupuncture, and Chinese herbal medicine. But, it’s worth noting that after about 20 minutes or more of using creams and sprays, loss of sensation, irritation, and loss of erection can occur. Reports of soreness from overusing delay vices were also seen. Side effects of treatments such as acupuncture and Chinese medicine were not adequately reported in the included studies. For those experiencing premature ejaculation, the news is good—there is an arsenal of treatment options out there that can work. Individual preferences and side effects vary, so it’s important to speak with your health care provider about which option might be optimal for you. Future research will need to explore whether these treatment options are safe and effective over the long-term and which ones work best (1).']"

If so, make sure your feet are in good health. This ground-up approach might be just what you need to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground. You’ve heard it before…falls are the number one reason why older adults in Canada end up in the hospital (1). Aside from minor scrapes and bruises, a fall can make youfearful of fallingagain, and can also lead to serious injury, or even death. Falls—which can happen just about anywhere (2;3;4)—also cost the health care system billions of dollars each year (2;5;6). There are lots of ways to prevent falls, including exercise, reviewing your medications, or getting your vision checked (2;7;8). Foot health is also important, but this strategy tends to receive less attention…until now, that is. Recently, there has been more research connecting falls to things like foot pain, week muscle strength, poor range of motion in your ankle, and bunions (2;9;10). Shoes can also be a problem, especially if they have a high heal, don’t have a strap, or have little contact with the sole of the foot (2;9-12). If you’re worried about your foot health, you may want to see a podiatrist. Podiatrists specialize in taking care of feet, and will assess, diagnose and treat lower limb problems to improve your ability to move. Possible treatments include removing unhealthy tissue, surgery, changing footwear, or orthotics (2;13). In Canada, you don’t need a referral from your doctor to see a podiatrist. And although they are not covered everywhere, podiatric services may be covered, at least in part, by some provincial health plans or by private insurance (14). But is a visit to a podiatrist a good investment? Arecentsystematic review—the first of its kind—looked at whether podiatry care (or foot care) reduces falls among older adults living in care homes or the community. Few of the studies in the review looked at older adults in care homes, so more firm conclusions can only be drawn for adults living in the community. Three different types of podiatry care were considered: 1) single component care: podiatrist care with insoles or off-the-shelf footwear; 2) multicomponent care: podiatrist care with advice, information, exercises, and footwear and/or orthotics, if needed; and 3) multifaceted care: risk assessment from a multidisciplinary team (a team of professionals from a variety of different specialties) and a referral to a podiatrist. All types of care took place for at least three months and up to two years. This review showed that both multicomponent and multifaceted care may decrease falls in older adults, although some people did report that they had increased foot pain after one year of multifaceted care. On the other hand, single component care was not effective. What’s more, people using insoles and off-the-shelf shoes reported ankle pain, blisters, and bruises, but these side effects did lessen over time. As you age, taking care of your feet could improve your chances of staying on them. This means that visiting a podiatrist may be one type of ‘trip’ worth making.']"
147,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2019/07/16/supporting-caregivers-of-frail-older-adults,16 July 2019,Supporting caregivers of frail older adults,"['The number of frail older adults in Canada is expected to rise from 1.1 million to more than 2 million by 2035.(1) Frailty is difficult to define, but most definitions consider it in terms of vulnerability,(2; 3) which can relate to physical, emotional and social factors.(4; 5) In relation to physical factors, this often means having a general lack of strength; being more vulnerable to disease (for example, having one or more chronic conditions) or disability (for example, a lack of mobility); and deteriorating in health more quickly as a result of diseases and disability (including cognitive deficits and/or dementia).(1) Emotional and social factors can relate to many things that lead to vulnerability (and eventually greater risk of functional impairments and diseases), including lack of emotional and social support and social isolation.(3) Frail older adults are at greater risk for chronic illnesses (6; 7) and disabilities which make it difficult to perform basic daily activities.(6; 8)Frail older adults have significant care needs, and often rely heavily on caregivers to support them.(9) A caregiver may be an intimate partner, a family member, a friend, or a volunteer who may also themselves be frail or at risk of becoming frail. The roles of caregivers of frail older adults can be significant and may take various forms, such as:(10)- providing emotional support;- transporting or accompanying patients to medical appointments;- reporting or managing side effects;- giving medicines;- keeping track of interventions (for example, for nutrition and exercise), medicines, test results and papers;- providing physical care (for example, feeding, dressing and bathing);- coordinating care (including navigating the system and advocating on behalf of their loved ones);- keeping family and friends informed; and- making legal and financial arrangements. Despite their crucial role, support for caregivers is often lacking or inconsistently available.(11; 12; 13) This lack of support can have a negative impact on the physical and mental health of caregivers, on their personal and professional lives, and on the quality of care that they provide.(14) As reported during a forum with caregiver groups: “Failure to recognize, acknowledge and support family caregivers heightens their risk of becoming ‘collateral casualties’ of the illness, compromises their health, reduces the efficacy of the help they can provide to their relatives, and increases costs to the health and social service systems.”(14) There is a growing body of research evidence examining interventions to support caregivers in their efforts to prevent, delay the onset of, and manage the burden of frailty. Addressing the economic security of caregiversWhile we found no systematic review on employment arrangements or income supports for caregivers, some policy proposals have recommended that there should be supports for employed caregivers to continue to work, and that assistance should be provided to those that are most in need.(11) Engaging caregivers in decision-making about needed care, and about how care and support is organizedOther interventions aim to engage caregivers in decision-making about how care and support is organized to ensure it is appropriate for their needs. Engaging caregivers was found to: create a more rewarding experience for healthcare staff; increase access for those with disabilities; simplify appointments; result in more efficient transportation between services; and increase organizational attitudes that support caregiver and patient involvement.(15)Providing materials to help caregivers make decisions (often called decision aids) were found to increase the understanding of care options, risks and outcomes, improve involvement, and support professionals in counseling and sharing information with patients and caregivers.(16; 17; 18; 19)Caregivers could also be provided with training to better prepare them to participate and engage in policy and care-planning discussion, and to determine what they see as appropriate supports for their specific situations.(20; 21)Providing education and supports to reduce caregiver burden and to help them cope and build resilienceThere is mixed evidence about whether education and training reduced caregiver burden.(22; 23; 24; 25) However, training in coping strategies was found to improve the mental well-being of caregivers.(26) In addition, providing assistance and emotional support to caregivers was found to improve their mental and physical health. It was also found to improve their engagement with social activities and reduce depression.(27) When education and training about the health needs of the person they are caring for was provided alongside assistance and emotional support, caregivers were found to have a reduced level of burden and stress.(28; 29) However, not enough evidence could be found to determine whether respite care (meaning, the services that provide a ‘break’ for caregivers) reduced caregiver burden.(30) It can be particularly challenging to provide care to a loved one.

However, there are ways lessen the blow on important aspects of your life. Heart failure is a progressive condition in which your heart no longer pumps enough blood and oxygen throughout your body (1;2;3). High blood pressure, heart disease or heart attack, and certain types of medications or chemicals—such as alcohol or illicit drugs—are a few of the many potential causes of heart failure (1). In Canada alone, over 90,000 adults over the age of 40 are diagnosed with heart failure each year (6). Heart failure that occurs overtime, as opposed to suddenly, is known as Chronic Heart Failure (CHF) (1). Unfortunately, CHF is on the rise around the globe (4;5). With about one-half to three-quarters of people dying within 5 years of their CHF diagnosis, such a diagnosis is more than enough to make you unsteady. Because your muscles and organs don’t get enough blood, completing everyday activities on your own can become difficult (2;7). Inevitably, your quality of life suffers (2;4;6). CHF is also very expensive for the health care system because of long, reoccurring (2), and unplanned hospital stays (5;8). It’s no surprise, then, that after your CHF diagnosis you may find yourself struggling to cope with the stress of your new reality. Although this paints a bleak picture, addressing those areas of your life that are negatively affected by CHF can make a big difference (2). One target is physical function—your ability to carry out the movements needed for everyday life (dressing, eating, etc.) and for activities that you enjoy (2;9). A second target is quality of life—your feelings about your position in life relative to your values, goals, and expectations (2;10). How you experience CHF can be just as important as the severity of your CHF (2;11). So, if you have CHF, what can you do to improve these two target areas? One option is to stay active. The heart is a muscle, after all! Arecentsystematic reviewlooked at the effect of different types of exercise on physical function and quality of life in people with CHF. Both aerobic exercise and strength training, or a combination of the two, were evaluated; dance, yoga, and tai chi were not. Exercise was done 2 to 5 times per week, lasted between 10 and 60 minutes, and was carried out over 8 weeks to 10 years. The review found that people with CHF who exercise may experience a large improvement in both physical function and quality of life. Interestingly, the researchers reported that exercise appeared to improve these outcomes regardless of the type of exercise, its duration, its frequency, or its intensity. It also didn’t seem to matter whether exercise was carried out at home or in a supervised setting. If you have CHF, take heart—exercise of any kind may improve your quality of life, as well as your ability to independently go about your day-to-day activities and do the things you need and love to do (2). For your own safety, remember to discuss any changes in your treatment plan, even the addition of exercise, with your health care provider first.

There may be many other individuals who do not seek support who continue to experience social distress, debt or other symptoms associated with problem gambling. Gambling-related harms may result in a number of individual challenges, including: health-related harms (including substance-use problems); emotional or psychological distress; relationship disruption, conflict or breakdown; reduced performance at work; financial harm; and criminal activity. These gambling-related harms may also affect family members, broader communities and the population as a whole, for example by placing strain on relationships or by negatively influencing the financial situations of families.The changes to both the gambling industry (including online gaming and venue expansion) and to the mental health and addictions sector provide a unique opportunity to consider what changes could be made to reduce gambling-related harms and better support those at risk of problem-gambling behaviours.(4; 5) There is a body of research evidence that could inform ways to improve the availability and accessibility of gambling services to reduce gambling-related harms, particularly through approaches that focus on entire communities and population (as opposed to focusing on individuals). This could mean pursuing any of the following: There is a wide variety of reliable tools available to screen individuals for gambling problems. However, there is some uncertainty about whether these can be relied on to identify problem-gambling behaviours in those who gamble online due to a limited number of studies and different characteristics of online gamblers such as poker players.(6; 7) Using internet and mobile technologies, such as cellphones and tablets, to deliver programs and services to help reduce gambling-related harms have shown promise, and have been found to be both time- and cost-effective.(8; 9) Different forms of gambling are more and less responsive to changes to the cost of playing (for example, requiring an entrance fee, increasing the price of a lottery ticket or increasing the price per play). Research evidence shows that when the cost of lottery tickets and horse racing increases, less people participate in these activities. However, this was not found to be the case when the cost of casino-based gambling increased.(10)Warning messages that pop-up over a player’s screen and require them to close the message can be used to reduce risky gambling behaviour.(11) In addition, research evidence shows that each of the following approaches supported healthy behaviour changes among individuals who gamble:- mandatory limit setting on the amount to be spent in one session;- individual bet limits when set as a low dollar value, such as $1;- mandatory shut-down at a certain hour or reducing casino operating hours; and- on-screen clocks that display cash spent rather than credits.(12) Gambling is not always just a game. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health has identified key signs of problem gambling,(13) which include\xa0: Behavioural signs:the person stops doing things he or she previously enjoyed; misses family events; changes patterns of sleep; ignores self-care or family tasks; or has conflicts with other people over money.Emotional signs\xa0:the person withdraws from family and friends; seems anxious; or has mood swings and sudden outbursts of anger.Financial signs\xa0:the person often borrows money; cashes in savings accounts, retirement savings, or insurance plans; alternates between being broke and flashing money; or has family members complaining that valuables are disappearing.Health signs\xa0:the person complains of stress-related health problems (for example, headaches, stomach and bowel problems, difficulty sleeping, or overeating or loss of appetite).

Say no to alcohol,"['If there is ever a time to refrain from drinking alcohol, it’s before you go ‘under the knife’. But why is abstaining so important before surgery? It all comes down to how well you come out on the other side. Worldwide, the number of people who drink alcohol is decreasing. However, among people who do choose to partake, the amount consumed per person is on the rise (1). Excessive drinking is associated with all sorts of health issues, including liver disease, damage to the pancreas, neurological problems (2-4), cancer, and HIV/AIDS (1). These conditions, alongside other infectious and chronic diseases, intentional injuries (from suicide or violence), and unintentional injuries (from falls, car crashes, drownings, etc.), help contribute to the 3 million global deaths that result from harmful drinking each year (3;5). Alcohol is not just a concern for long-term health. People who drink multiple alcoholic beverages per day are also at higher risk of complications after surgery (3), such as infection, bleeding, or heart and lung problems (3;6). This is especially true for people who engage in “risky drinking”, which equals 3 standard drinks per day or 21 drinks per week (3). One standard drink is a 12-ounce bottle of beer, a 1.5 ounce shot of hard liquor, or a 5-ounce glass of wine (7). Why are alcohol and surgery such a bad combination? Well, alcohol consumption can reduce heart (3;8) and immune system function, prolong bleeding time, and increase the body’s stress response (3;9). All of which are risk factors for developing complications following surgery (3). Arecentsystematic reviewlooked at the effect of intensive approaches—included patient education, treatment of withdrawal, medication to prevent relapse—that aimed to help “risky drinkers” scheduled for surgery to quit drinking before surgery. These surgeries were either planned in advance for non-emergency conditions (e.g., hip replacements), or were for emergency conditions requiring relatively speedy care (e.g., serious ankle injuries). For pre-planned surgeries, intensive programs took place in the weeks leading up to the surgery, while in emergency cases, the programs took place right before or after the surgery. The review found that intensive approaches occurring over 4 to 8 weeks may reduce post-surgery complications, such as the need for a second surgery, issues around the wound, or heart and lung-related problems. It also appeared that these intensive programs may increase the number of people who successfully quit drinking by the end of the program, while potentially reducing the amount of alcohol consumed in those that continued to drink following surgery. Unfortunately, there was not enough information to determine how these intensive approaches impacted length of hospital stays or the risk of death from complications due to surgery. Despite the promising results, more high-quality research on this topic area is needed. Future research should include a greater number of participants, be conducted in different settings (e.g., countries), and evaluate strategies other than intensive approaches (3). The bottom line is, the less alcohol you drink before surgery, the better. Kicking alcohol to the curb may help maximize your chance of a speedy, complication-free recovery.

This is especially true for parents of children with serious health problems or disabilities requiring constant care. For example, parents of children with intellectual disabilities must sometimes provide constant care for their children, even during adulthood. This is even more common as the life expectancy of these children has improved overall, partly due to medical and social innovations. For example, more than 40% of people with Down syndrome now live to the age of 60.(1; 2)These parents often face considerable challenges, including planning for their children\'s future care arrangements while anticipating their own aging and death. It is important to understand their reality and their concerns in order to better support these older parents and their adult children. A recent systematic review examined 14 studies of older parents of adult children with intellectual disabilities living at home or in the community.(3) More specifically, the review explored older parents\' perceptions of future care arrangements for their children.Overall, studies have shown that these older parents are aware of the need to plan the care arrangements for their children or, at least, they have preferences for such arrangements. However, a combination of factors seems to hinder the planning process. The obstaclesStudies have identified important barriers for older parents that contribute to their lack of planning. These parents often have a sense of helplessness, avoidance, denial and guilt about leaving their child in other people’s care. Sometimes older parents are hopeful that the problem will solve itself when the time comes, or are under the impression that their child will most likely pass away before them.Studies focusing on adult children living at home highlighted other factors that may explain why older parents do not plan their child\'s future care arrangements, including: a lack of information, a lack of knowledge regarding services available (for example, available residences or home care options), distrust in available services, and dissatisfaction with the bureaucracy that manages programs and services. These findings appear particularly salient for families who are culturally and linguistically isolated. Other studies also pointed out that older parents do not perceive having professional support to plan future care arrangements; the work of professionals being more focused on crisis management.Studies focusing on adult children living in an institution in the community indicated that older parents did not feel the pressure to plan future care arrangements. These parents feel that the services are already in place to meet the needs of their child and that the role of caregiver no longer belongs to them. Various types of ""plans""The review revealed a variety of ""plans"" and ways to plan future care arrangements. Some parents say they have developed ""plans"" without talking to their child or other family members. Many others focused only on planning for the social and emotional needs of their child rather than seeking solutions for financial and legal issues, for example. We never know what the future holds. It is therefore important to get your affairs in order: - Check with the office of the public guardian and trustee in your province or territory to understand how to protect yourself or your child, or consult a lawyer or notary.(4)- Communicate your values and wishes for treatment and care for you and your child. If possible, involve your child, their care providers and your loved ones in these conversations.(5)']"

Take the heat out of menopause with these treatments","['Irregular periods (1;2), hot flashes, night sweats, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, mood changes—you guessed it…menopause (3;4). As women age, they produce less and less female sex hormones like estrogen and progesterone until one day they no longer menstruate (5). Otherwise known as “the change”, a woman has officially reached menopause when she has not had a period in 12 months (1). This typically happens at about age 50, but it can start earlier too (1;6). Although menopause most often occurs from natural changes in hormone levels (3), other culprits include surgical removal of the uterus, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or when for certain reasons—like disease or genetics—ovaries are unable to make the needed levels of female sex hormones (5). Whether menopause is triggered by a natural or unnatural process, its many symptoms can range from mild to severe and can be a challenge to deal with. For instance, in some women, symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be mildly annoying (3;7). But for others, these symptoms leave them desperate to escape the unrelenting waves of heat and sweat that hinder their ability to go about their daily lives (3;7;8). In fact, those pesky hot flashes and night sweats are among the most common complaints (2), affecting up to a whopping 85% of all women (9;10). Luckily, several treatments are available to help women cope with menopause’s hormone-induced heat waves (8), but just which options are actually backed by evidence? Arecentsystematic reviewfound that there are a few different drug and non-drug treatments that may reduce the frequency of hot flashes and night sweats in women experiencing natural menopause and with an intact uterus. The treatment options looked at included: real and “fake” acupuncture, hormone replacement therapy patches or pills containing estrogen and progestogen, other hormone replacement therapies—liketiboloneandisoflavones, non-hormonal drugs likeraloxifene, antidepressants, Chinese herbal medicine, black cohosh (a plant root), and multibotanicals. Results showed that hormone replacement patches, as well asisoflavonesand black cohosh were all effective in reducing how often women experienced hot flashes and night sweats compared toplacebo, and generally with minimal side effects. However, becauseisoflavonesand black cohosh were prepared differently across the studies included in the review, it was not possible to pin point which preparation of each worked best. The individual safety of every preparation does also need to be considered. In addition to these three effective treatments, there was also some evidence to suggest that hormone replacement therapy pills might work. Unfortunately, for those looking for more treatment options to choose from, fake and real acupuncture,tibolone,raloxifene, antidepressants, Chinese herbal medicine, and multibotanicals did not appear to have an effect when compared toplacebo. Although no treatment was shown to be clearly better than the others, the authors of the review concluded that hormone therapy patches may work best. Do you feel like you are suffering amid your own personal heat wave? If your answer is yes, there are a few promising options to discuss with your health care provider.']"

It involves psychomotor, visual and cognitive skills. However, as you get older, some of these skills may gradually decrease and affect your driving. Over time, our pupils become smaller and this can affect our ability to adjust to changes in light and to perceive contrasts. Hearing loss can affect our ability to respond to our environment. A decrease in motor skills can affect our reaction time (for example, evaluating distances, seeing intersections or staying in one's lane). Not to mention other health factors that can affect older adults’ ability to drive, such as arthritis, stroke, heart disease, and cognitive disorders.(1)Automotive technologies are evolving rapidly. New so-called ‘smart’ technologies facilitating driving have emerged and are now increasingly available in vehicles. But what does research tell us about the impact of these smart technologies on older drivers? A recent systematic review examined 28 studies on smart, in-vehicle technologies. Two types of technologies were identified: 1) in-vehicle information systems and 2) advanced driving assistance systems. The studies examined whether these systems met the needs of older drivers, improved their comfort (both physical and psychological), and improved their safety (that is, reduced the risk of errors or collisions). Some of these studies have been conducted on driving simulators and others on the road. Only two studies focused on older drivers with at-risk medical conditions, more specifically Parkinson's disease or Alzheimer's disease.(2) The systematic review identified 15 in-vehicle information systems, nine of which were effective in improving the safety of older drivers, such as: - audible message systems providing safety-related messages led to fewer strong decelerations and route errors, and helped control speeds when approaching an intersection\xa0; - collision avoidance systems providing auditory and visual cues led to faster reaction times for forward and side collisions with objects; - curve speed warning systems helped drivers moderate their speed when approaching curves; - speed adaptation systems reminded drivers of local speed limits and prompted them to slow down; - intersection warning systems providing visual, auditory and tactile warnings helped to stop drivers at intersections when conditions were dangerous; - lane change or lane departure warning systems reduced unintended lane departure, without increasing distraction\xa0; and - night vision enhancement systems providing tactile and auditory warnings improved drivers’ detection of pedestrians. While the review identified other in-vehicle information systems, the research evidence about their effectiveness was either mixed or inconclusive. Overall, the benefits of in-vehicle information systems are decreasing as the information presented to drivers becomes more complex. For example, the visual, auditory or cognitive limitations of drivers affect their ability to comprehensively perceive and interpret information presented on both the dashboard and their environment, and influence their ability to quickly process the information or to react to avoid a collision, for example. The systematic review identified five effective advanced driving assistance systems: - adaptive cruise control systems improved speed control in traffic, built-up areas, and low-speed limit areas; - assisted parallel parking systems reduced the number of times needed to back-up into a parking space; - active steering assist systems helped drivers maintain their lane position; - brake assist systems improved stopping distance when there is a need for emergency braking; and - lane keeping systems providing steering assistance improved lane maintenance, as well as the perceived comfort of older drivers. Overall, all these smart in-vehicle technologies seem effective only if they are consistent with the driver's capacities. For example, a beep to warn of a collision will not be effective if the driver has hearing loss. In addition, smart in-vehicle technologies can improve safety and comfort while driving, but only if they do not increase the cognitive workload of drivers (meaning the level of mental effort a driver must provide in response to one or more cognitive tasks). For example, if a driver needs to focus on the dashboard screen to try to understand all the information presented, the driver may no longer look at the road and see that the traffic lights are red. Finally, it is important to note that none of the studies identified in this systematic review examined whether these technologies actually met the needs of older drivers. Drivers can now rely on new technologies to drive more safely. Remember that it is possible to have your vehicle adapted to respond to your specific needs. An occupational therapist can assess your needs and recommend adaptation to your vehicle. It is also important to become familiar with your vehicle's new technologies. Again, an occupational therapist can provide you with training on the optimal and safe use of new technologies in your vehicle.(3)""]"

What about acupuncture?,"['Many people have a love-hate relationship with their joints. While healthy joints allow a person to enjoy many of life’s activities, painful joints can be extremely debilitating. Osteoarthritis is one of the most common sources of joint pain, affecting almost five million Canadians (1) and almost half of people over the age of 65 with arthritis. It often rears its ugly head at or after age 50 (2;5) when the cartilage that normally protects the joints starts to wear down (2;3). Women are more at risk than men (3;4), and certain jobs, sports (3), and lifestyle factors (e.g., obesity, lack of exercise) can also increase the risk. Unfortunately, osteoarthritis can severely impact a person’s quality of life (4;6). Along with pain, it decreases joint mobility, weakens muscles, and makes it more difficult to carry out daily activities (2;8). Although osteoarthritis can affect any joint, it’s most often found in the knees, hands, spine, and hips (2;9). In fact, it makes older adults quite literally ‘weak in the knees’, with knees being the joints where they most often experience osteoarthritis pain (7). While there is no cure for osteoarthritis (2), many treatments are available to help manage it (10;11). These include medication,exercise(11), physical therapy, assistive devices, and surgery (12). A more recent addition to this arsenal is…acupuncture (11;14)! This ancient practice in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (13) uses needles to stimulate specific points around the body. These points represent the vital energy ‘qi’ that flows through the body (15). Sustaining the flow of ‘qi’ is believed to play an important role in improving and maintaining health (16;17). Although there are several theories, it is not clear exactly how acupuncture works (15), but for those in pain, the more relevant question is…how well does it work? Twosystematic reviewsaimed to answer this question. Thefirstsystematic reviewlooked at whether acupuncture could improve pain and joint function in people with chronic osteoarthritis knee pain (e.g., lasting more than three months), compared to ‘fake’ acupuncture, usual care, or no treatment. People received 6 to 23 sessions of acupuncture at least once per week for 3 to 36 weeks. Each session involved at least four acupuncture points, and was carried out for at least 20 minutes. Overall, the results were promising! People who received acupuncture had less short-term pain (up to 13 weeks) and better short-term (up to 13 weeks) and long-term\xa0(up to 26 weeks) physical functioning, although there was no effect seen on long-term pain (11). However, one newerreviewprovided evidence that acupuncture could relieve chronic pain for 12 months or more, and to a degree that wasclinically significant(14). Painful joints from osteoarthritis can have a huge negative impact on quality of life. Acupuncture may offer an alternative way to treat this debilitating condition.']"

We may become incapacitated. There are various degrees of incapacity: it can be partial or total, temporary or permanent.(1) This incapacity can be due to a mental illness or intellectual disability, the consequences of an accident, a stroke, or a degenerative disease like Alzheimer's. Many incapacitated people can rely on family members or friends who can step in and act as their protector, representative, or substitute decision-maker. These people can thus protect their health and well-being, and manage their affairs.(2) However, many incapacitated individuals are alone. They do not have the ability to make decisions, they do not have advance directives (it is a legal document that only takes effect if they are unable to communicate) or the ability to carry out their directives, and they do not have a family member or friend who may be their protector, representative or substitute decision-maker.(2; 4) These individuals require a public guardian. A public guardian is a case manager whose job is to make legal and personal decisions on behalf of incapacitated individuals. Such situations are already common and will be even more so in the future. The 2016 census reveals that one-person households are the most common in Canada (accounting for 28.2% of all Canadian households).(3) Combined with a longer life-expectancy and growing geographical mobility, the chances of aging alone (and becoming incapacitated) are therefore considerable.(3) But what can we learn from the research on unbefriended older adults? A recent systematic review was conducted by Canadian researchers to identify studies published since the 1990s on unbefriended older adults in Canada and the United States.(4) Despite an extensive documentary search, only five studies conducted in the United States have been identified, revealing a very limited body of research evidence on this pressing issue. Existing research evidence paints a grim picture of unbefriended older adults, particularly in terms of their poor quality of life. Unbefriended older adults are more likely to be single and childless, to have fewer siblings, and to have limited financial resources compared to older adults with a family member or friend who acts as their guardian. Unbefriended older adults often have dementia (or a cognitive impairment affecting their ability to remember, learn new things, focus or make decisions that affect their daily lives) and multiple chronic diseases. The review also revealed a lack of coordination among governments, which has resulted in variability and inconsistency in the monitoring of unbefriended older adults. In addition, the authors pointed out the alarming lack of population data about unbefriended older adults. This is all the more disturbing as it is a high-risk and vulnerable population, and that public-guardianship systems face serious challenges, including long waiting times, considerable workloads and limited resources.(2) The researchers concluded that future research should monitor unbefriended older adults over time and identify their unmet care needs. In addition, future research should also examine whether guardianship programs and services are used differently based on the demographic characteristics of unbefriended older adults. Such research could inform how to strengthen or reform public-guardianship systems. We never know what the future holds. It is therefore important to get your affairs in order:- Check with the office of the public guardian and trustee in your province or territory to understand how to protect yourself or your loved ones, or consult a lawyer or notary.- Prepare a power of attorney for personal care (so that the trusted person you designate can make decisions about your health care, housing or other aspects of your life) and a power of attorney for property (so that the trusted person you designate can make decisions about your financial affairs) if you become mentally incapable of making these decisions.(5; 6)- Communicate your values and wishes for treatment and care - this will help your substitute decision-maker that you designated to make the best health decisions if you become mentally incapable of making these decisions, which can be very complex and emotional (especially at the end of life).(5)""]"

The situation is crummy but you assume it will pass…until things take a turn for the worse. What you thought was a minor hiccup in your day is actually a full-blown cold, leaving you wondering how you might prevent such an unwelcome turn of events in the future. Acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs)—which are often caused by bacteria or viruses (1)—are the source of roughly five million deaths around the globe each year (2). They are infections that get in the way of normal breathing (3), and come with symptoms like congestion, runny nose, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, and fatigue (3). The common cold (3), ear infections, bronchitis, tonsillitis (4), and pneumonia (2) all fall under this umbrella. When it comes to colds and other similar illnesses,vitamin Csupplementation has generally been the ‘hot’ topic of conversation. But…while we were all talking about vitamin C, another supplement was thrown into the mix. Enter our good ol’ friend vitamin D, a vitamin classically known for building and maintaining strong bones (5). It turns out that this superpower vitamin also protects against germs that affect the respiratory system (6;7;8;9). The two main forms of vitamin D are vitamin D2 and vitamin D3. Vitamin D2 is not made naturally, but is found in foods such as egg yolks, mushrooms, and fortified milk and yogurt (10). On the other hand, vitamin D3 is made in the body after exposure to the sun (10), and is also found in foods such as fatty fish (5). Both forms of vitamin D can also be taken as supplements (5;6;10). Research has found that people with low levels of vitamin D may be more likely to get ARTIs (6;11). So, the next logical question is…can vitamin D supplements help prevent them? Arecentsystematic reviewlooked at whether taking vitamin D supplements reduces the risk of ARTIs. The potential benefits were studied in people of all ages, and in both healthy individuals, as well as those with respiratory conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In most cases, vitamin D was taken by mouth as vitamin D3 pills for seven weeks to one-and-a-half years. Supplements were consumed at lower doses (generally 0.02 to 0.05 mg) daily or weekly, or higher doses (generally 2.4 to 3 mg) every one to three months, or through a combined effort of frequent low-dose and infrequent high-dose schedules. The results were generally positive! The review found that vitamin D3 supplements did, in fact, lower the risk of developing ARTIs, with no serious side effects observed. The greatest benefit was seen with daily or weekly supplementation, especially in people who had low vitamin D levels to begin with. Interestingly, people who received one or more large doses of vitamin D (e.g. once, monthly, or every two months), in addition to their daily regimen, did not experience these benefits. While vitamin D3 reduced the risk of developing an ARTI, it had no effect on the risk of hospitalization or emergency department visits due to ARTIs (6). All in all, it’s important to remember that while vitamin D can help ward off respiratory infections in some people, always make sure to discuss taking supplements with your healthcare provider—because supplements may not always be safe for everyone.']"

The number of young workers entering the labour market is not offsetting the loss of older workers who are retiring, which is causing a labour shortage that is already being felt in many sectors.(1) As a result, recruiting experienced and skilled workers has become a challenge. No wonder companies are putting in place incentives to hire older workers or to retain older workers who are contemplating retirement. Governments are also involved in introducing fiscal measures to delay workers' retirement or to encourage those in retirement to return to the labour market.(2)Although there is a desperate need for experienced and skilled labour, older workers are facing challenges. In fact, many of them face stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination because of their age.(3) This phenomenon, known as ageism, is widespread and has adverse effects on the health and well-being of older workers, while marginalizing and excluding them. It can also have devastating impacts on the work climate and organizational productivity.(4) Can research evidence shed light on this phenomenon? A recent systematic review examined 43 studies on ageism in the workplace.(5) Four main themes emerged from the analysis: Stereotypes and perceptions of older workers Some studies show that positive stereotypes exist about older workers, who are sometimes seen as more sociable, reliable or loyal than younger workers. Nevertheless, the majority of stereotypes associated with older workers are negative: less competent, less productive, unable to use new technologies or learning new things, cognitively and physically limited. These prejudices are unfortunately shared by several employers or human-resource managers, among others. Intended behaviours towards older workers Studies show that many employers have negative intentions regarding the hiring of older workers. With equal qualifications, employers seem to prefer hiring a younger worker. Also, human-resource managers are less likely to ask an older worker to update their knowledge and encourage them to take training. Most employers do not intend to retain their older workers for a long period of time, and many older workers end up internalizing these negative perceptions: these older workers will be more likely not to seek training and plan to leave their organization early. Discriminatory practices denounced by older workers Studies revealed that there are discriminatory practices in terms of recruitment, hiring, training, promotion and retention of older workers. For example, employers have reported using Internet advertisements to limit older workers' access to job opportunities, believing that older workers do not use the Internet in their job search. Strategies used by older workers to deal (or negotiate) with ageism Although few studies have addressed this theme, it appears that older workers who have internalized ageism in their workplace are increasingly disengaged, remaining away from promotions or lowering their job expectations. On the other hand, many older job-seekers have adopted strategies to prevent employers from guessing their age, for example by withdrawing years of graduation from their resumes. Older workers are an asset to our society. Thus, we need to create an environment conducive to their participation in the labour market and thus combat ageism. But dealing with ageism is not an easy task because we have to combat stereotypes, prejudices and discrimination against older people who go beyond the workplace. That said, many governments and organizations seek to promote the participation of older people in the labour market, including through:- awareness campaigns to combat ageism;- financial incentives to hire older workers or support their retention;- occupational health and safety initiatives targeting older workers;- favourable fiscal measures such as adjustments to retirement income systems;- training for older workers to upgrade their skills; and- adaptation measures in the workplace.(2) If you are employed (or if you are looking for a job) and you think you are discriminated against because of your age, remember that this is illegal. You cannot be denied a job, training, or promotion, or forced to retire, because of your age.\xa0With very few exceptions, mandatory retirement is not allowed\xa0in Canada. You can make a complaint to your organization, to your provincial or territorial human rights agency, or to courts that may be competent depending on the circumstances.""]"

And yet, many people—as many as 1 in 8 adults in Canada—find themselves on it at some time in their life (1). In fact, when it comes to older adults 60 years of age and older, depression is the most widespread psychiatric disorder (2;3;4;5). When depression hits, it can be like a heavy fog that settles in, enveloping a person in sadness and a loss of interest in doing the things they once enjoyed. Anger, frustration, and exhaustion may also latch on (6). Although depression can affect people of any age, it can be particularly hard to diagnose in older adults (2;7). Symptoms to watch out for in this age group include memory difficulties, personality changes, physical pain, fatigue, low appetite, staying home, or suicidal thinking (6). When someone is in the midst of depression, happiness can seem a million miles away. Fortunately, there are a variety of options—both medication and therapy—to treat depression. There is also research exploring ways to escape its grip before it takes hold. One of those ways is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT is a type of psychotherapy that aims to identify negative or false thoughts, and replace them with healthier, more positive ones. This allows people to respond to challenging situations more effectively (8;9;10). We already know that CBT can help treat depression andmindfulness-based cognitive therapycan help avoid relapse. But, can CBT or other approaches help prevent depression all together? Onesystematic reviewexplored whether psychological or educational approaches—such as CBT, self-help, counselling, education, or support—can help prevent depression. The impact of these strategies on preventing depression was assessed among individuals who did not have an actual depression diagnosis, although some may have had depression like symptoms, while others may have been at high risk for depression. This review found that CBT—the most commonly used approach—and other psychological and educational approaches, delivered by a variety of providers, had a modest effect on preventing depression. What’s more, the benefits of these therapies increased when the participants receiving them did not already have symptoms of depression. Although the current evidence is promising, more research is needed to determine which types of depression prevention programs are the most effective, and how these effects hold up in the long-term (8). As the saying goes, prevention is the best medicine. Fortunately, psychological and educational approaches, including cognitive based therapy, do appear to help ward off depression before it grabs hold. Prevention programs developed around these approaches just might help people steer away from this difficult road.']"

Retirement is synonymous with freedom for many, but for others it brings its share of anxiety and questioning. Retirement perceptions, expectations and planning vary from one individual to another. But what are the main factors that influence the transition period between work and retirement? A recent systematic review examined 230 studies conducted in member countries of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).(1) Here is an overview of the top eight factors that appear to be influencing retirement perceptions, expectations and planning: Figure 1. Eight factors influencing retirement perceptions, expectations and planning There appear to be significant differences between men and women in retirement attitudes, retirement readiness, and adjustment capacity in retirement. Overall, studies show that men have a more positive attitude towards retirement and are more engaged in retirement planning than women (the latter often reporting uncertainties in preparing for retirement). These differences are rooted in individual and historical differences in men\'s and women\'s participation in the labour market (women have a greater burden as caregivers and are often in more precarious situations). Women\'s retirement plans are much more closely linked to their health and that of their partners, than are men’s plans. Finally, women seem to have more difficulty adjusting to retirement than men. Studies show that it is more the perception that people have of their financial situation, rather than their actual situation, that influences their feeling towards adapting to retirement. That said, people in a better financial position are more likely to plan for retirement. In addition, people from disadvantaged socio-economic groups generally have more negative retirement experiences. Few studies have examined ethnic and cultural differences in retirement, which prevents researchers from drawing definitive conclusions. That said, some studies indicate that people from ethnocultural minorities tend to have more positive expectations about retirement. However, they plan less for retirement and their economic situations during retirement are often more precarious. There is a fair amount of literature on the impact of family status, especially marital status, on health and well-being during retirement. Overall, marriage is associated with better retirement planning. In addition, collaboration among married couples can help them during the transition to retirement. However, the researchers noted that the studies had a ""hetero-normative"" bias, that is, they focused on heterosexual couples and thus neglected to study same-sex couples. It is well known that people with health problems are likely to retire earlier than those in good health. In addition, poor health is often associated with poorer retirement planning. However, people with disabilities will tend to plan their retirement more carefully. When health problems lead to early retirement, this appears to have a negative impact on the ability to adjust to retirement. How we perceive the world and how others perceive us can have a tremendous impact on what we do, when, and how. Ageism in the workplace (which are forms of discrimination, exclusion and age-based biases) may encourage older workers to retire earlier than they might want to (especially older men). Conversely, positive views about aging and retirement appear to be associated with better retirement planning and the intention to retire early. The nature of work (and the perceptions older workers have about their profession and their work environment) plays a key role in the timing of retirement and retirement experience. For example, workers with limited autonomy tend to take early retirement. In addition, when work is important to a person\'s identity, retirement becomes a source of conflict and anxiety. Retirees who have not taken the time to plan for retirement generally do not feel in control and experience more negative effects and stress. Overall, studies reveal a widespread lack of preparation for retirement. This can be exacerbated for people experiencing a decline in cognitive capacities which can be related to aging. Such a decline can have a major impact on people\'s retirement planning and sense of control. We are not all equal when it comes to retirement, but we can all take steps to prepare for it in order to achieve the most harmonious transition possible.- Clarify your expectations and preferences for work and retirement, in light of your personal and family circumstances.- Think about what meaningful roles you could play in your new retiree life.(2)- Practice your financial literacy skills. This is an essential skill, especially in retirement, as seniors and their caregivers face the challenge of preparing a realistic budget based on fixed and often limited incomes, while reconciling many priority expenses.(3)']"

But, for many of us, there will come a point when we will be unable to do so (1;2). Fortunately, Canadians are becoming more and more interested in expressing their wishes about the healthcare they would like to receive at the end of their life (3). One way to make these desires known and ensure that they are honoured is through advance care planning. This form of planning involves discussions between you (the patient), your family, and your healthcare providers around understanding your end-of-life wishes, and planning for future healthcare decisions in the event you are unable to communicate or make these decisions on your own (1;4). It provides clarity, and takes care of the overlap between health care, ethical values, and legal rights (3). In aprevious blog, Dr. Michelle Howard from McMaster University explained that she encourages all older adults to have ‘the talk’—sooner rather than later. So, say you take that advice and engage in advance care planning, what does this mean for you and your loved ones? Onesystematic reviewfound that advance care planning may be beneficial for both patients and their families. Here, advance care planning included strategies such as information about advance care planning, communication between patients, family members, and healthcare professionals within home, hospice, nursing home, hospital or community settings, or even education for healthcare providers. This research showed that advance care planning can increase documentation around end-of-life care preferences (for instance through durable powers of attorney or living wills), as well as the chances that the care provided aligns with the patient’s end-of-life wishes. Improved patient knowledge about living wills and life-sustaining treatments was also seen in some studies. Additionally, there was some evidence to suggest that implementing advance care planning strategies in nursing homes and long-term care may lead to reductions in avoidable and distressing hospitalizations in frail older adults. The review wasn’t done yet…the good news kept on coming! For caregivers and decision-makers, it was demonstrated that advance care planning strategies may reduce the stress, anxiety, and depression that they often experience when their loved one passes. What’s more, these strategies may also leave caregivers more satisfied with the care that was provided.\xa0While these findings are promising, the review also highlighted the need for better-conducted research, which uses appropriate study designs and looks at a wide-range of outcomes and settings, in order to draw more definitive conclusions on the effects of advance care planning (1). So, there it is…end-of-life care is difficult to discuss. But, despite how hard ‘the talk’ is, advance care planning may be an important piece of the health care puzzle, which can benefit both you and your caregivers by providing clarity around sensitive care decisions.']"

In the past, several generations were living under the same roof and grandparents contributed to the education and development of their grandchildren. Today, families are smaller, scattered and geographically dispersed. That said, parents often seek help and support to fulfil their parental responsibilities. Many families rely on grandparents to take care of their children on a regular basis. According to Statistics Canada, it is estimated that 47% of Canadians aged 45 and over are grandparents. Each grandparent has an average of four grandchildren.(1) They are generally very engaged with their grandchildren, whether babysitting them, or supporting and accompanying them during school activities.(2) Nearly 8% of grandparents live with their grandchildren in a shared home.(3) The majority of grandparents who live in a shared home with their grandchildren (88%) also live with one or more persons from the ‘middle generation’ (most commonly a younger couple or a lone parent). The remaining grandparents (12%) live with their grandchildren as primary caregivers and the parents are not present.(4) Although they have some experience, having raised their own children, grandparents may face new challenges, some of which are unique to their grandchildren's generation. Can parenting interventions equip them to fulfil their role with grandchildren? Despite the key role played by grandparents in caring for their grandchildren, the literature on interventions to improve their parenting skills remains limited. A recent high-quality systematic review identified eight studies conducted mainly in the United States, but also in South Africa and Australia. These studies examined the effects of various parenting interventions targeting grandparents, including: parental coaching programs (including self-help strategies, expressive writing activities, parenting and social skills training, training on common health problems in children, and legal assistance); home visits; social-work activities in group or individualized settings; and summer camps. The small samples in the studies, the great heterogeneity in the duration of the interventions and the elements evaluated, and the wide range of interventions and professionals delivering these interventions (including parents, social workers, nurses, regulated and non-regulated professionals, and legal professionals) do not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn. However, studies revealed some positive effects of interventions in reducing mental health issues experienced by grandparents, such as depression (six studies), stress (four studies) and anxiety (two studies), as well as improving the quality of life (one study), social interactions (two studies) support (two studies), parenting skills (four studies), communication skills (one study) and adaptability skills (one study). Grandparents often have an unconditional love for their grandchildren. They are therefore willing and enthusiastic to play a growing role in the lives of their grandchildren. However, it is not easy to define your role and responsibilities as grandparents, so the following tips are suggested:- remember that, as a grandparent, you can play a significant role in fostering your grandchildren’s early learning and shaping their social and emotional skills;- have a frank discussion with the parents about how best to support them and support the development of your grandchildren (keeping in mind your own capacities and means);- call parent support services in your community to talk with other grandparents raising their grandchildren and learn about programs and services that can support you (6); and- if you think the parents are unable to keep their children safe and to take care of their physical and emotional needs, or if you think your grandchildren are being abused and neglected, report it immediately to the authorities.(6)""]"

But what if you could take charge and manage your illness instead of letting it manage you? Chronic diseases—such as cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory diseases, and mood and anxiety disorders (1)—are growing at an alarming rate (2;3). The risk is particularly high in the aging population, with many Canadians over the age of 50 suffering from multiple chronic illnesses at once (4). Unfortunately, the more chronic conditions you have, the more likely it is that your quality of life will be poor, that you will end up in the hospital, and that you will get conflicting information from your healthcare providers (5). Most often, the management of chronic illness is ""reactive"", meaning that action is taken when you are sick. But, a different way to deal with chronic illness is to be ""proactive""and meet it head-on, this means placing the emphasis on nourishing your ability to manage your own condition(s) and health instead. This shift is the aim of the Chronic Care Model (6;7;8;9), which looks to empower and encourage you to be an active participant in your own health, by making you more knowledgeable about your health condition(s) and involving you in decisions around your care (6). Personalized care planning is one strategy that follows this model. At its core, it involves you and your healthcare provider (and potentially even your caregiver) discussing the treatment and management of your condition(s), and then working together to develop appropriate management goals and an action plan for achieving them. At its most comprehensive, personalized care planning is a seven-step process that involves: patient preparation, goal setting, developing an action plan, documenting the process, coordination of the process by the healthcare provider, patient support, and monitoring of progress. Planning can lead to conversations about tests, treatments, information about self-management, education, support, or ways to change behaviours, problem solve, or manage stress (6). Sounds great, right? But how beneficial is it? Onesystematic reviewlooked at the effects of personalized care planning on physical and mental health, the ability to self-manage medical conditions, and the use of health services in people with chronic diseases—including diabetes, asthma, mental health problems, heart failure, and kidney disease. Personalized care planning was compared to instances where healthcare professionals were the sole decision makers. So, after all was said and done, what was the takeaway? Well, it may come as no surprise that personalized care planning was found to have several benefits for patients. In particular, the review showed that this tailored approach can result in decreases in blood sugar levels and some aspects of blood pressure in people with diabetes, improve lung function in people with asthma, reduce depression symptoms, and increase confidence and skills for disease self-management. Although these effects were often small, personalized care planning may be most beneficial when it includes more stages of the seven-step process, involves more frequent contact between patients and healthcare providers, and is used by the patient’s usual healthcare provider. Even better…negative side effects as a result of this approach were not seen (6). For many people, chronic illness is a fact of life. But, personalized care planning can inform and empower you to better manage your health and care decisions. Maybe it’s time to talk to your healthcare provider about how you can collaborate throughout your health care journey!']"
163,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2019/03/27/taking-action-together-to-address-homelessness,27 March 2019,Taking action together to address homelessness,"['On any given night, more than 35,000 individuals are experiencing homelessness in Canada. Each year, it is more than 235,000 individuals who will experience homelessness in the country.(1) Historically, homeless people in Canada were older, single males. That being said, the current crisis seems to reveal a much more diverse picture. Indeed, there are more women, families and youth today who are homeless than in the past. The number of people aged 50 and over who are homeless, however, continues to increase. They represent 24.4% of users in homeless shelters.(1)These statistics resonate with other reports indicating that older adults are at increasing risk of homelessness due to a lack of support, precarious health, economic and housing situations, and a lack of age-appropriate programs and services.(2; 3; 4) The risk of homelessness can also be aggravated by many factors, including the death of a spouse, the lack of social housing, social isolation, or a past filled with abuse and violence. But what can be done to reduce homelessness? A recent high-quality systematic review examined 43 studies, including 37 from the United States.(5) These studies examined the effectiveness of interventions to reduce homelessness and increase residential stability for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.Overall, several housing programs combined with case-management interventions appear promising compared to usual services (for example, day centers, hospital emergencies, outpatient clinics). The authors of the systematic review indicated that there is still some uncertainty in these findings since most of the studies may have overestimated or underestimated the true intervention effects due to some limitations in how the studies were conducted. And given the very diverse homeless population, there is still some gaps regarding some age-specific groups, including disadvantaged youth and older adults. Having said that, here are some specific observations regarding the interventions examined in the review: Case managers are individuals guiding homeless people (or those at risk) into the health and social system, and facilitating their access to resources and services. Support provided by case managers reduces the number of people with mental health and addiction problems who report being homeless by almost one-third. Individuals who received more intensive case management were less likely to be homeless and more likely to be in stable housing, compared to individuals who are offered the usual services. This program considers housing to be a fundamental right. Two core elements of the program include psychiatric rehabilitation and consumer choice. Users are thus encouraged to define their own needs and goals. Housing is provided to them and there are no restrictions related to sobriety. However, treatment is offered, as well as access to a nurse practitioner. This program improves the residential stability of people with mental health or chronic conditions and reduces homelessness compared to usual services. Other programs emphasize the need for a transitional period of sobriety and adherence to treatment before allowing homeless people to live independently in their own apartments. Housing is available to these people, but they must stop using alcohol or drugs. This program reduces the number of days spent homeless compared to usual services. However, its effects are uncertain due to the demands of users to abstain from alcohol and drugs. For adults with mental health and addiction problems, a combination of housing and case management appears more effective in reducing the number of days spent homeless. It also appears to be more effective to promote residential stability in the short and medium term. Some governments provide financial support for individuals to be able to find housing. These allowances can help homeless families move out of temporary shelters faster and stay out of shelters for extended periods of time. Combined with case management, this financial support is probably more effective than usual services or case management alone for adults with mental health problems and chronic conditions.Homelessness is a tragic and complex phenomenon, which may affect youth, families, older adults, and many others. The current body of synthesized research evidence offers a glimmer of hope. It reveals that we can collectively take action and leverage the assets of our health and social systems to address homelessness.']"

Getting influenza, or the “flu”, is a miserable experience for anyone. Sudden fever, muscle aches, chills (1;2), cough, nasal congestion, and a sore throat can make you feel like you’ve been hit by a truck (2). Luckily, for many the flu will resolve on its own. But for some it can lead to serious complications (1;2), including inflammation of the heart or brain, pneumonia, or even death (1). Older adults (1), people living in nursing homes or long-term care, or people with weakened immune systems or certain chronic health conditions are especially at risk for these complications (2). Regardless of the match between the flu vaccine and circulating flu viruses in any given year, the flu vaccine is thesingle best wayto protect yourself against the flu (1;3;4). Among the general population, the flu shot can reduce flu risk by 40% to 60%, which helps prevent thousands of flu-related hospitalizations annually (5). Age also plays a role in determining the effectiveness of the flu shot. For example, while the vaccine reduces the likelihood of getting the flu by up to 90% in children, adolescents, and young adults, among older adults the risk of getting the flu is reduced by 30% to 40% (1;6). But, what if there was a simple way to boost the effectiveness of the flu vaccine among older adults? Recent research explored whether prebiotic and probiotic supplementation could do just that (1). Probiotics—also referred to as “good” bacteria—are live bacteria that support overall health. Prebiotics, on the other hand, are substances that promote the growth of these beneficial bacteria (1;7). Both are found in food—oats, beans, and bananas are prebiotic foods, while kimchi, sauerkraut, and kombucha tea are probiotic foods (7). So, does supplementation with these immune-boosters enhance the protection offered by the flu vaccine? A recentsystematic reviewandmeta-analysisfound that taking prebiotic or probiotic supplements before a flu shot can improve the effectiveness of the vaccine. This review evaluated people who had taken probiotic supplements alone, prebiotics and probiotics together, or prebiotic supplements mixed with other substances like vitamins, minerals, oils, or fermented milk. Supplements were taken for at least two weeks, and up to 28 weeks before receiving flu vaccines designed to protect against the H1N1, H3N2, and B flu strains. Overall, people who took prebiotics or probiotics before receiving their flu shot had increased protection from certain strains of the flu compared to those who received aplacebo. Specifically, healthy older adults who took the supplements over longer periods of time seemed to benefit the most. These results are promising, but future research will be useful in determining the best combination of supplements, dose at which they need to be taken, and for how long in order to achieve the most benefit and to help further support the findings seen here (1). Clearer conclusions around side effects and safety are also needed. So there you have it! The flu shot remains the best way to protect yourself against the flu, but supplementation with prebiotics or probiotics before getting the vaccine may be one way to boost its protective effects.']"

An environment is totally immersive if it stimulates the five senses (vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste), but also allows interaction and communication with others. Some immersive technologies use ""virtual reality"" to artificially reproduce a sensory experience (for example, you can recreate a virtual environment to help patients confront their fear of heights), while other technologies rely on ""augmented reality"" which superimposes virtual images on the real environment (for example, a smartphone application that enriches the visitor experience of a museum by providing content if the person watches through their phone).(4)Immersive technologies are developing at great speed and have spread to many areas, such as arts, entertainment, education, the military and medicine.(4) Some people even envision that immersive technologies may be a promising way to break social isolation and loneliness among older adults.(3) But what does research tell us about this technological solution? A systematic review identified 28 studies examining the use of immersive technologies in older adults.(5) The effects of immersive technologies on the social aspects of aging are still poorly studied, with emphasis mostly on cognitive, physical and sensory effects of these technologies. However, some studies reveal that immersive technologies have the potential to promote healthy aging.The studies included in the systematic review examined a limited number of immersive technologies used by older adults: 1) games and simulations; 2) social-assistance robots; and 3) social technologies. The games included action games, strategy games, or multi-player online games. These types of games appear to have a positive influence on the attention, information processing and memory of older adults. More specifically, shooting games improved visual attention and speed of response. Strategy games helped to improve memory. Role-playing games improved memory and reasoning skills. As for multi-player online games, they improved the speed of response, reasoning and memory in the context of social interactions with other players. Social-assistance robots (including robotic pets) aim to improve the quality of life of seniors. These robots can help to perform daily activities (eating, bathing, managing drugs), but also can improve mobility, improve cognitive functions and provide a sense of security. Some robots interact verbally and with facial expressions to simulate emotions, which in turn encouraged older adults to express themselves more. They showed potential to improve the psychological well-being of older adults by addressing certain emotional needs, decreasing loneliness and promoting social interaction. The so-called ""social"" technologies aim to help older adults communicate with the outside world. These technologies offer older adults opportunities to socialize and develop their social networks. Some social technologies can be integrated in the furniture in older adults\' houses and can be connected with online social networks (for example, a digital picture frame connected to Facebook allowing users to view updated photos of their family members and interact with them). Although these technologies can facilitate social interactions despite mobility problems and bridge the distance between older adults and their loved ones, there are still obstacles that prevent some older adults from using them actively, such as the complexity of social technologies and the declining cognitive capacities of some older adults. Our world may become smaller as we get older. Mobility problems can limit our activities and confine us to our homes. Our social networks can become more limited. Therefore, immersive technologies appear attractive to open a whole new world (even virtual) to older adults who may suffer from loneliness and social isolation.(3) That being said, the evidence on the effect of immersive technologies on loneliness and social isolation among older adults remains limited. Moreover, some experts expressed concerns about possible adverse effects of immersive technologies, which may actually increase social isolation.(6) Since these technologies are likely to take a much greater part in our daily lives, more and more people may prefer to spend the majority of their time in virtual spaces.(6) Other experts also revealed that people can be ostracized, ignored and excluded in virtual environments,(7) which may have negative consequences on their health and well-being. So, if you want to immerse yourself in these new technologies, proceed with caution and be aware that they may affect your health and well-being.']"

I know because I’ve done it thousands of times”. Everyone knows that smoking is bad for you—it increases the risk of countless diseases, including heart disease, stroke, and cancer (1). In fact, 100 Canadians die of a smoking-related illness every day (2). But despite these warnings, about 5 million Canadians—that’s 16% of us—regularly light up (3). On the flip side, quitting smoking is a powerful way to improve health. Within a year of quitting, the risk of heart attack goes down; 2-5 years later, the risk of stroke and many types of cancer also plunges (1). Although the benefits of quitting smoking are well known, many smokers find it hard to kick the habit. Why? The culprit is nicotine, a highly addictive drug. Nicotine keeps people reaching for their next cigarette by causing pleasant physical and mood-changing effects in the brain. Also, withdrawal symptoms such as cravings, irritability, anger, insomnia, hunger, or restlessness occur when nicotine is withheld (4). Despite the power of nicotine, there is reason for optimism in the fight against smoking! Enter… nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), a strategy that works to help smokers quit (5;6). NRT, which comes in the form of gum, lozenges, inhalers, sprays, or patches, is designed to take the place of the nicotine that a smoker would receive from a cigarette (5). In doing so, it relieves some of the physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms that occur when a person tries to quit (5;6). Luckily, in many countries these products are available over-the-counter and do not need a prescription from a doctor (7). Previous research has shown that smokers using NRT are two times more likely to cut the number of cigarettes smoked per day in half (8)—but can it help people stop smoking in the long-term? A recentsystematic reviewexplored whether NRT can increase the chances that people who are motivated to quit smoking will successfully quit in the long-term; beyond six months. Different forms of NRT were considered, including gum, patches, oral spray, inhalers, tablets, or lozenges. The intensity of additional support provided varied from low and limited to routine medical care, to high such as numerous visits to clinics. As many would hope, the results were positive. The review found high quality evidence that all the forms of NRT studied were effective in helping smokers who wanted to quit increase their chances of long-term quitting. In fact, these chances increased by 50% to 60%. Interestingly, the level or intensity of additional support received did not appear to impact the effectiveness of NRT, meaning NRT was effective either way.\xa0 Side effects of NRT were dependent on the type of NRT being used, and commonly included irritation at the location the NRT was applied or taken—so skin, nose, throat or mouth irritation. However, side effects were often minor. Chest pains and heart palpitations also occurred, but rarely, with no increased risk of severe heart complications observed. So there it is, in those motivated to quit smoking, evidence supports that NRT is effective in increasing chances of long-term quitting... helping them nip the habit in the “butt”!']"

They are designing their garden plans and thinking about timelines to execute their plans, and some are about to start their seeds indoors.Gardening is sometimes considered as a simple hobby, but think again! It is an amazing activity that can have positive effects on health and well-being. You may have heard people mentioning the therapeutic benefits of gardening, whether it is to maintain physical fitness, improve flexibility, coordination and strength,(1) enhance physiological and psychological relaxation,(2) improve self-esteem and depression symptoms,(3) encourage creativity,(4) and create social bonds (and even intergenerational relationships).(5) Well, there is research evidence to support many of these claims! A systematic review identified 22 studies that examined the benefits of gardening for older adults living in the community or in institutions.(6) The majority of studies included in the review revealed that gardening is an activity appreciated by older adults that has positive effects on their physical health, cognitive abilities, nutrition, spirituality and social engagement. Gardening can even improve their level of autonomy and their quality of life.The review also revealed that gardening allows seniors to reminisce childhood and family memories. It is therefore a comforting activity for older adults who can reconnect with their past, their culture and nature. Gardening activities conducted in a group can also promote social interaction and community support.While the observed benefits of gardening are promising, they may not be the same for everyone. The review highlighted the need to further explore the effects of gardening on people with dementia and older adults with disabilities. Before taking out your shovels and rakes, take some time to plan your gardening activities:(7) Think about your health and safety: You may have a condition that prevents you from enjoying some gardening activities. You also need to assess your garden and the landscape to identify potential risks for falls, to protect yourself from the sun at all times, and to vary positions when working in the garden. Adapt:The gardening activities, the tools, and the garden itself can be adapted to suit your needs and capacities (for example, installing raised garden beds or using lightweight and ergonomic tools may reduce the physical demand associated with gardening). Socialize\xa0:Don’t go at it alone! Take advantage of community or local garden groups to connect with others, and share your passion and knowledge. By sharing gardening tasks with others, you may be able to find tasks that can better suit your needs and capacities (for example, digging, planting, watering, or harvesting fruits, vegetables and flowers). And nothing is better than enjoying the fruits of your labors with others!']"

Although these changes may not be permanent—with some people regaining partial or full limb function (1;3;4;5)—the road to recovery can be long. But did you know that it is possible to trick the brain into believing what it sees? Mirror therapy is being used more and more in stroke rehabilitation to dupe the brain and restore limb function (1).Stroke affects up to 10% of older adults in Canada (6), making it the third leading cause of death nationally (7), and one of the leading causes of disability worldwide (1;8). Stroke occurs when the blood supply to the brain is interrupted or reduced, causing brain cells to die (9). This can cause a variety of temporary or permanent disabilities, including paralysis (1;3), pain (1;10) or difficulty completing daily activities such as walking, eating, or getting dressed (1).Mirror therapy may be one way to help stroke survivors recover movement in their arms and legs (1). During mirror therapy, a mirror is used to create a reflection of an unaffected arm or leg in place of the affected limb (1;11). When the unaffected limb is moved, the mirror image “tricks” the brain into thinking that the affected limb is moving (1;12). Although it is unclear exactly how this process works (1), it’s been suggested that this illusion causes changes in the brain that help the person recover their mobility (1;13). Even better, mirror therapy is relatively easy to do, and has the potential to be completed at home by the individual themselves (1).But does this approach really work, or is it all smoke and mirrors? A recentsystematic reviewshowed that mirror therapy is a promising approach to stroke rehabilitation. Mirror therapy was studied in the time shortly after stroke and up to 6 months later, for both arm and leg rehabilitation. It was delivered in hospitals, as part of inpatient and outpatient rehabilitation, and at home. Most studies included in the review used a mirror box to deliver the therapy, although two studies used virtual reflection on a screen. In some cases, mirror therapy was combined with other strategies such as electrical stimulation. Mirror therapy was carried out 3-7 times a week for 2-8 weeks, and for 15-60 minutes at a time.This review found that mirror therapy can be safe and effective. In fact, it improved upper and lower limb movement in affected limbs and the ability to conduct daily activities for up to and potentially beyond 6 months after stroke, with no side effects reported. While there was also some evidence that mirror therapy may reduce pain, definitive conclusions could not be made based on the studies included in the review. It’s also important to keep in mind that it’s not yet clear if mirror therapy can replace other types of stroke therapy—since more research is needed comparing mirror therapy used on its own to other strategies.Overall, there is cause for optimism, as mirror therapy appears to be a good strategy that can be added to other stroke rehabilitation approaches (1).']"
169,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2019/02/13/aging-behind-bars,13 February 2019,Aging behind bars,"['In 2015-16, an estimated 120,568 adults were in custody or under supervision in Canada. Although the inmate population tends to be relatively young, admissions to detention centres of persons aged 50 and over increased by 22% in federal institutions and by 7% in provincial and territorial institutions over the previous five years.(1) One in four inmates in Canada is over the age of 50.(2; 3)Aging behind bars poses challenges. A recent systematic review of international studies shed light on how prison conditions can affect the health of older inmates: the limited and noisy physical environment; the bullying and physical violence experienced by older inmates; involuntary negligence of prison staff due to limited training and inadequate knowledge of the care required by older inmates; limited health education and lack of access to medical care; high costs of specialized resources required; the often overlooked mental health issues that are exacerbated by the loneliness and social isolation of the prison environment; and poor access to health care and social services upon release from prison.(4)It is said that 10 years can be added to the chronological age of an inmate according to the Correctional Investigator of Canada, Ivan Zinger. This reflects the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases among inmates,(5) but also the impact of living and aging behind bars. Indeed, older inmates are more likely to develop aging-related conditions compared to the general population. This poses challenges for the prison system. Not only are older inmates the most expensive inmates to incarcerate, but the system is often poorly equipped to cope with an aging prison population. A damning report by the Correctional Investigator of Canada sounded the alarm in 2011: mobility and accessibility problems for older inmates; limited access to care that could maximize the independence of older inmates and access to palliative care; limited employment and vocational training programs; and vulnerability and victimization of older inmates.(6) In recent years, the Correctional Service of Canada has been developing a strategy to adapt the prison system to the needs of older inmates.However, it is not easy to find effective, acceptable and safe solutions to address aging-related issues in detention facilities. Some experts proposed specific facilities for older inmates who are serving their sentences, parole programs for older inmates, and compassionate releases for those with advanced and serious illnesses.(7; 8) Others also proposed the implementation of aged-care programs for older inmates. A recent systematic review examined such age-care programs for older inmates.(4) The evidence on the effectiveness of physical, psychosocial and spiritual activity programs is rather limited, but it seems they may not be effective in reducing distress, depression or anxiety among older inmates, and may not improve prison adjustment and other health outcomes. Studies, however, identified some promising practices, including those that address the specific needs of older inmates (including age-related health issues, loneliness and isolation, anxiety and avoidance behaviours common among older inmates), those that encourage the participation of older inmates, those that nurture collaboration with prison staff, but also those that promote a sense of control and independence among older inmates, their creativity and peer support.Of course, the problems experienced by older inmates are unlikely to raise a lot of public concerns: ""Why should we care?” Beyond the legal and moral arguments for better support for older inmates, we should consider how this can help society as a whole.(9) Since the vast majority of inmates end up being released into the community, it is important to look into how prison conditions affect older inmates and the support provided to them in order to ensure the success of their rehabilitation and social reintegration.']"

Unfortunately, about 40% of older adults experience loneliness, while 7-17% report being socially isolated. Although these terms are often used in place of one another, social isolation and loneliness are not quite the same thing (1). Social isolation refers to an actual lack of social support and meaningful contact, whereas loneliness refers to a person’s belief that they are lacking or have lost companionship, and the negative feelings that stem from this (1;2).Whether actual or perceived,social isolationandlonelinesscan have real impacts on the overall health and well-being of older adults (1;3). In fact, social isolation is linked with increased death (1;4), dementia (1;5), depression, and risk of elder abuse (6); while loneliness is associated with increased blood pressure (3;7), cognitive decline (3;8), and reducing the body’s ability to protect itself from infections (3;9).There are many reasons why older adults may spend more time on their own—living alone, the death of loved ones, certain health conditions, and a lack of access to transportation are just a few examples (6). Fortunately, efforts are underway to identify strategies to combat social isolation and loneliness, and the worrisome health effects that come along with them (1;3;10). Onesystematic reviewexplored the effectiveness of a variety of programs aimed at reducing social isolation and/or loneliness in older adults. This review found that some of these programs may help improve physical, mental (e.g. depression and mental wellbeing), and social (e.g. social support and loneliness) health in older adults who are or are thought to be lonely or socially isolated. Overall, programs that were group-based, grounded in theory, and incorporated active input from participants and social support/activity appeared to provide the most benefit.Some of the specific programs that were found to be effective include: a psychosocial activity group involving art, discussions, therapeutic writing, group therapy, and exercise that led to new friendships; a coping group that led to improved functional health in people with chronic rheumatic disorders; a psychosocial group focusing on health education, coping skills, and stress management that helped women with breast cancer gain more confidants and reduce loneliness; and a bereavement support group for widows that led to enhanced socialization and reduced depression (1).Another systematic review assessing health promotion strategies –such as bereavement support, peer support, and education– further supports the idea that the characteristics of programs or strategies that aim to address loneliness and social isolation in older adults play an important role in effectiveness. Here it was found that the small number of strategies that were effective in reducing or preventing loneliness and social isolation were once again group-based, included support activities or this time education as well, were geared towards specific groups of older adults (e.g. women, widowers, caregivers), and provided older adults with the opportunity to assist in developing and carrying out the activities involved in the strategy or program (10).A more recentmeta analysistargeted solely on loneliness also introduced the idea that strategies that focus on changing a person’s negative perceptions and thoughts –for example through cognitive behavioral therapy– may be even more beneficial for reducing loneliness than those that focus on enhancing social support (3).Overall, the current evidence-base around approaches to tackling social isolation and loneliness in older adults shows some promising strategies, while highlighting that the characteristics of the program or strategy being used are important in determining success. A need for more recent high quality studies, which are well-designed and properly report on outcomes is also apparent, so more definitive conclusions can be made (1;3;10).']"

This could be to satisfy their thirst for knowledge, to achieve personal fulfillment, to build new bonds, to stay active, to find meaning in their lives, to adapt to change or to develop new skills.(1) But participating in lifelong learning activities can also improve health and well-being in later life. Indeed, it has been shown to improve psychosocial outcomes, selfâ\x80\x90esteem, selfâ\x80\x90efficacy, a sense of purpose and hope, competences, and social integration.(2; 3) No wonder so many older adults go back to school, while others turn to online learning. Online courses have become a common alternative to traditional classroom learning and have been promoted to democratize higher education.(4) By the end of 2018, it was estimated that more than 900 universities had announced or launched more than 11,400 online courses that are referred as Massive Online Open Courses (or MOOCs).(4; 5) And these do not include the countless online learning opportunities offered by businesses and other organizations around the world. Online courses offer learning that can be flexible, interactive and collaborative, that allow you to learn from instructors all over the world.(5; 6) Whether it’s a course in anthropology, arts and culture, computer sciences, criminology, economics, geography, health, history, or sociology, there is an online course for you! A systematic review published in 2016 revealed that few studies have examined the experiences of older adults participating in online courses (specifically in Massive Open Online Courses).(7) However, the review showed that older adults are interested in learning online, with people over 56 representing up to 40% of learners in the ten courses that have been examined. Findings from the review also indicated that older adults have more time to dedicate to online courses, which, coupled with their life experiences, allows them to be very active and to help other learners through online platforms. Engaging in online learning also appeared promising to foster a sense of belonging to a group (albeit virtual), improve self-esteem, and help address social isolation among older adults.(7) There are countless online courses offered by a multitude of providers from around the world. Before registering to an online course, take some time to make an informed decision:- Make a list of your learning interests and identify your priorities;- Set learning goals (for example, do you want to enroll in a course because you are simply curious and want to learn casually, or do you want to earn a degree);- Choose the course that best reflects your learning interests and goals (for example, check the list of online courses offered by the university of your choice, or consult sites listing online courses offered by providers from around the world);- Test the online platform to see if it is user-friendly (and spend some time familiarizing yourself with how it works); and- Actively learn (do not forget to schedule time for the course in your daily routine and interact with other learners).']"

Do popular diets actually work?,"['Do you need to lose weight? If so, you’re not alone. The number of people carrying excess pounds is on the rise around the globe (1). In Canada, roughly 34% of Canadians are overweight, and an additional 20% are obese (2). This amounts to a weighty problem—extra pounds carry with them an increased risk of many health problems, including heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. In a bid to lose weight, many people turn to trendy diets. There is no shortage of options out there—a whopping 38 popular diets were listed in a recent U.S. News & World Report of “Best Weight-Loss Diets”. Although popular, experts have questioned if these diets really work and if they are safe (3). Arecentsystematic reviewtook a closer look at which of the popular diets outlined in the U.S. News & World Report are backed by evidence when they are practiced in their original format – meaning without calorie targets, meal replacements, commercial products, or structured exercise programs beyond what the diet itself recommends (3). It turns out that of the 20 diets that met the inclusion criteria, only seven—Atkins, DASH, Glycemic-index, Mediterranean, Ornish, Paleolithic, and Zone— had undergone rigorous testing. The Mediterranean Diet includes mostly fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts, and olive oil (3). The Paleolithic Diet emphasizes protein and discourages carbs (4). The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) Diet includes foods that are high in fiber and low in fats, such as fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products (5). The Glycemic-Index Diet includes low glycemic foods like non-starchy vegetables and beans (6). The Ornish Diet limits the amount of fat that you can eat (2). Lastly, the Zone Diet recommends eating a lower amount of carbs (7). So, what’s the bottom line? Can these diets help you lose weight and keep it off? The review evaluated which popular diets produce weight loss in the short (within 6 months) and long-term (beyond a year) (3). It covered seven different types of diets: Atkins, DASH, Glycemic-index, Mediterranean, Ornish, Paleolithic, and Zone. Although there are plenty of other popular diets out there, many have not been well-studied or studied at all. All the studies included in this review required people to stick with their diets for at least 12 weeks (3). Of all these diets, Atkins—which focusses on limiting carbs (7)—was supported by the most evidence that it can lead to short-term and long-term weight loss (3). As for the other 6 diets, there is simply not enough evidence to say if they are effective or not. Two diets—the Mediterranean and Paleolithic diets—were promising, as both were associated with short-and long-term weight loss, but based on only one study for each outcome. For the Zone Diet, evidence was mixed, but any weight loss may be limited to the short-term. In contrast, the DASH, Glycemic-index, and Ornish diets did not produce any meaningful effect over time. Although this review found that a low-carb diet was successful for weight loss, the safety of this type of diet, as well as other popular diets still needs to be assessed. People considering trendy diets should also take stock of the fact that participants in many of the studies had a hard time actually sticking to the diets, with only a small number maintaining the diet beyond the study (3). The verdict:while there are many diets out there that promise to trim your waistline, only Atkins is supported by evidence that it can produce both short-and long-term weight loss. However, the safety of Atkins and other popular diets is unknown at this time.']"

This is especially true when they are moving to a long-term care facility, assisted-living centre or nursing home. Residents are particularly vulnerable to abuse due to their loss of independence, diminished physical and cognitive capacities, and the fact that they live near many strangers (including other residents, employees and visitors).Sexual assault is one of the most heinous forms of abuse, and older adults living in facilities may become victims. This is a largely hidden problem. Sexual assaults are rarely disclosed by victims, and they are often poorly documented by staff and rarely reported to authorities: reports on elder abuse often refer to abuse in general without clearly identifying sexual assaults. In addition, nursing-home staff appear poorly trained and equipped to deal with such problems.(1)What can research tell us in order to shed light on this problem? A recent systematic review of 15 studies examined the profile of sexual assault victims and the profile of perpetrators, as well as the medico-legal characteristics of sexual assaults occurring in nursing homes.(2)According to the studies analyzed in the review, sexual assault was the least frequently observed, suspected and reported type of abuse in nursing homes. Victims of sexual assault were more likely to be women with disabilities who received financial assistance to live in a nursing home. The perpetrators were more likely to be male residents or staff with criminal histories. Assaults usually occur in the evening when there are fewer staff.The review also emphasizes that it is difficult to intervene. Even if it is suspected that a sexual assault has occurred, it can be complex to obtain information from a potential victim whose health status and cognitive capacities are impaired. The concept of consent is also difficult to assess with such vulnerable victims. In addition, the negative stereotypes that predominate with respect to the elderly and sexuality, the increased dependence of residents on others, and the solidarity of staff members are obstacles that hinder the declaration, detection and prevention of sexual assaults in nursing homes.The studies also highlight the lack of training of nursing-home staff regarding how to deal with sexual assaults. In addition, studies also reveal that signs of sexual abuse were not systematically documented, and the evidence was sometimes accidentally destroyed (for example, following the washing of sheets and maintenance of residents' rooms). The collection of biological evidence left by the aggressors is challenging since many nursing homes do not have adequate tools (such as forensic kits) or established intervention protocols.Not only do these obstacles mean that perpetrators will not face justice, but it also means that many victims will not receive the care they need. In fact, sexually assaulted women suffered from 50% to 70% more gynecological, central nervous system, and stress-related problems. A study even revealed that more than 50% of the victims died within one year of being assaulted. It goes without saying that it is important to frequently visit (and get news from) your loved ones living in a long-term care facility, assisted-living centre or nursing home. Stay alert for signs of physical and sexual abuse, including:- unexplained depression, fear or paranoia;- discomfort or anxiety in the presence of certain people;- visible scratches, bruises, nicks, swelling or burns that are unexplained;- clothes that are ripped, soiled or covered with blood;- sexually transmitted diseases and other unexplained infections; and- vague or illogical explanations regarding injuries (whether these explanations are provided by your loved ones or the nursing-home staff).(3) If you see something, say something.(4)""]"

So, when that window clouds over, our lives are impacted.Cataracts are one common source of cloudy vision—caused by clouding of the lens inside the eye (1;2)—and can lead to partial or total blindness (2;3). In fact, cataracts are the cause of approximately half of all cases of blindness worldwide (4).Cataracts usually develop slowly (5), and often go unchecked until they start to affect daily activities like reading or driving (3). Common symptoms include blurry vision, seeing haloes around lights (1), glare, and changes to colour vision (2). You may also find that you need to crank up the lights while reading (1), or that your eyeglass prescription is constantly changing (1;2).Aging is a common cause of cataracts, but they can also occur with injury (5). Diabetes, previous eye surgery, and steroid medications put you at even greater risk (5). You are also at higher risk if you smoke, drink large amounts of alcohol (5), are obese or have high blood pressure, so keeping these factors in check can help ward off this condition (1).Cataract surgery—which replaces the cloudy lens in the eye with an artificial lens (3)—is becoming more and more common (6). In fact, as many as 175,000 surgeries are performed in Ontario each year (7). Although cataract surgery is the only way to treat cataracts that cause more than mild symptoms, different types of artificial lenses can be used. The two most common choices are monofocal and multifocal lenses (2).But just how do these two lens options compare? Onesystematic reviewshows that there are pros and cons to both monofocal and multifocal lenses for cataract surgery. Monofocal lenses correct either distance or near vision, whereas multifocal lenses correct near and distance vision at once.For distance vision, monofocal and multifocal lenses appear to produce similar results. However, multifocal lenses may have some advantages over monofocal lenses—such as potentially producing better near vision, and helping people reduce their likelihood of needing glasses. The downside is that people with multifocal lenses did report more cataract-like symptoms—such as seeing glare and halos—following surgery than those with monofocal lenses. Unfortunately, most studies in the review did not assess the effects of the different lenses on outcomes such as satisfaction with the surgery or quality of life, and where data did exist, the findings were inconsistent (2).Cataract surgery provides an opportunity to see the world through a different lens. Although the quality of the evidence varies, both multifocal and monofocal lenses are effective options for cataract surgery (2). Speak with your healthcare provider about which lens might work best for you.']"

After all, this is one of the pillars of democracy.(1) Yet, the role of citizens has evolved significantly with recent advances in information and communication technologies. Public debates, as well as consultations led by governments, are increasingly being conducted online, including on social media.Popular social media platforms include Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, WhatsApp, Google+, MySpace, LinkedIn, and many others. While each has its own characteristics, they also share some common features. Social media can be accessed via Internet-based technologies on computers, as well on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets. They are interactive and rely on content generated by users (such as writing comments, participating in discussions, posting photos or sharing videos). They can facilitate the creation of online networks by connecting individuals and groups with shared interests and goals.(2)Social media are becoming common tools in politics. They have often been promoted as a democratic tool that can empower their users, but recent reports have also raised concerns about the risks of social media manipulations.(3) What is known about the use of social media by older citizens who want to be engaged and have their voices heard? A systematic review examined how older citizens were considering online tools such as social media to participate in public debates and to advocate for policy changes.(4) Unfortunately, few studies have addressed this issue so far. The majority of studies focused on the use of social networks by older people to socialize with family and friends, or to obtain health information.Studies highlighted significant barriers to the use of social media by older citizens. For instance, current social media structures seem to limit the participation of older citizens or exclude them outright from online public debates that concern them. For example, the design of computer tools and online platforms are rarely adapted to the needs and capacities of older adults. Similarly, social media have led to the development of new (and complex) social norms which govern activities on these online platforms, but also to the use of a new language with new words, acronyms and abbreviations. Older citizens may be less familiar with these new norms and language, and they often express concerns about privacy online which affect their desire and capacity to share information. Finally, limited income, as well as diminished cognitive and physical capacities associated with aging, appear to slow down the uptake of social media among older citizens. These factors can collectively contribute to the disengagement of older citizens from public debates on social media.So, should we forget about social media to engage older citizens? Not necessarily. Social media remain promising in many ways. They can help to rapidly share and access information, and allow people to participate in public debates from anywhere, anytime, and without restrictions related to mobility or geography. However, for social media to be relevant to older citizens, significant barriers must be overcome. These barriers extend beyond facilitating access to computer equipment or to the Internet, or improving the ability of older citizens to use social media. Older citizens must be actively involved in designing more inclusive online environments that are responsive to their specific needs.']"

Employers increasingly promote intergenerational collaborative work to use the skills of older employees and to transfer the tricks of the trade to new, junior employees.(1) Schools and recreational centers set up programs where children visits nursing homes to do some arts and crafts. Universities promote cohabitation programs to connect students looking for low-cost housing with older adults who have a free room and can benefit from support and companionship.(2) But what do we know about the effectiveness of intergenerational programs? Many intergenerational programs are supported by research evidence. A recent systematic review highlighted the benefits of intergenerational interventions, whether face-to-face, virtual or combined, in different settings and contexts: schools, health and social services centers, day centers, or private residences. (3) Findings from this systematic review indicate that intergenerational programs are appropriate and effective for older adults, including people with dementia. They have the potential to nurture a sense of being useful to society (such as the feeling that older people are able to guide and positively influence future generations), to improve the well-being of older adults, but also to reduce the stigma associated with aging and discrimination against older adults. In addition, by enabling older adults to mentor or tutor children and youth, intergenerational interventions have the potential to improve students' academic, behavioral, social-emotional and motivational outcomes. Intergenerational programs seem to benefit young people, older adults, and society as a whole. Some programs may be time limited and informal (for example, teaching children how to grow vegetables in a community garden, reading to children at the municipal library, or allowing young people to provide computer support to older adults), while others may require formal partnerships (for example, relocating a daycare centre or a primary-school class to a nursing home, or implementing an intergenerational mentoring program in a school). Guides are available to support individuals and organizations who wish to set up intergenerational programs.(4; 5) Let's take advantage of them to learn how to build strong communities with strong intergenerational bonds!""]"

Family caregivers must tirelessly adapt to ever-changing — and often emotionally charged — situations, all while watching their loved one’s mind and personality disappear into a fog (3). Although rewarding, the job can take a mental and physical toll.In Canada alone, more than 402, 000 people 65 years and older live with dementia (1). Dementia can rob a person of their memory, thinking, and social abilities, leading to difficulty communicating, confusion, personality changes, depression, and agitation (3).Caring for someone with dementia can be time-consuming and costly. Unpaid caregivers spend an average of 74 hours a week providing care, and up to $4,600 per year on the person they are caring for (1). But the cost of caregiving goes well beyond time and money. Family caregivers will often put their loved one’s needs ahead of their own, at the expense of their own health and well-being (4). They may become cut off from their social supports (6;7), spend less time with friends, or engage in stressful disagreements about the person they are caring for (5;7). This translates into 45% of family caregivers experiencing distress (2), and 39% experiencing depression (5). Depression and burden, in combination with declining social support and health in caregivers, can then lead to the person in care being more likely to end up in an assisted living facility (5;8).To overcome these challenges, dementia caregivers need effective support. Past studies have focused on single component strategies to help family caregivers cope. But how about strategies that combine multiple components? Can they help ease caregiver burden? New research has explored this question (5). Arecentsystematic reviewandmeta analysislooked at the effectiveness of combining multiple components aimed at supporting informal family caregivers of people with dementia who live with their care recipient. These components included education and skills training, counselling, support groups, stress management, exercise and health promotion, telephone support, role play, and environmental modification.Two specific programs were assessed in multiple studies: the New York University Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center (NYU-ADRC) psychosocial program, and the Resources for Enhancing Alzheimer’s Caregiver Health (REACH) II program. NYU-ADRC provides caregivers with six individual and family counselling sessions over four months, and ongoing support groups and phone counselling. REACH II includes a combination of education, support, role play, stress management, engagement in pleasant activities, phone support, and skills training.The review found that in comparison to single component strategies, usual care, or nothing, multicomponent strategies can reduce burden and depression, and improve health and social support in caregivers. It also appears that the NYU-ADRC program may reduce depression, potentially for up to five years; while the REACH II program may positively impact depression and overall health.Unfortunately, the review did not determine which combination of components works best, but education, skills training, counselling, support, and stress, and mood management were most often included in successful strategies (5).The emotional and physical demands of caring for a loved one with dementia are enormous. Fortunately, there are multicomponent strategies that can be used to support family caregivers, allowing them to care for themselves while continuing to care for their loved ones.']"

But being prepared to face disasters (natural or man-made) is not an easy task. Recent research on climate change and rapid urbanization predicts an increase in the intensity and frequency of natural disasters, including hurricanes, ice and snowstorms, floods, droughts and heatwaves.(1) Older adults are particularly vulnerable to such disasters.(2) But what does the research tell us about their ability to cope with and recover from disasters? A systematic review of 33 articles examined the key factors influencing the capacity of older adults to cope with disasters (also known as ‘resilience’).(1) Seniors' resilience to disasters is a complex issue involving many factors ranging from individual characteristics (for example, health status, age, income, marital status, beliefs or prior exposure to similar stressful events) to social and organizational factors (for example, access to social support, access to health and social services, and access to information and communication channels). Let’s take income as an example. We sometimes wonder why people living in flood zones do not move to a safer zone to avoid future floods. The reason may be as simple as not having the financial means to do so. Income also has an impact on how well people are able to recover from a disaster. Several studies show that low-income older adults are more likely to struggle financially and may be unable to rebuild their homes and their livelihoods. Low incomes can thus exacerbate the stress generated by a disaster. This is especially true for older adults whose incomes are dependent on natural resources that are affected by disasters, such as fishermen, tour guides, or fruit and vegetable producers. These individuals are more likely to experience mental and physical health problems after a disaster. Another factor is the level of social support of older adults. Social support has a certain influence before, during and after a disaster: all studies report a better response when older adults are well supported. The decision to evacuate is often made following discussions with relatives and neighbours. Having more social support means less depression, generalized anxiety disorder or post-traumatic stress following disasters. Also, being part of a community and helping with reconstruction help to shape a sense of belonging and purpose. Communication channels commonly used to provide information during disasters often disadvantage older adults. The authorities responsible for public safety in case of disasters increasingly use social media like Facebook and Twitter, as well as digital television, as part of their information and alert systems. Research shows that these channels seem to be used to a lesser extent by older adults. Finally, the health status of older adults is an important factor. Pre-existing health conditions often worsen after disasters, as older adults no longer have access to all the care they need (for example, lost medication, damaged medical devices, absence of support staff). In addition, studies show that authorities often implement evacuation or security procedures that are not always suitable for older adults, such as hiding under tables or requiring people to carry heavy equipment to build a dike. Older adults with mobility or cognitive problems will also have difficulty accessing emergency resources set up by the authorities. Being prepared for a disaster or other emergency means at least four key elements: 1. Identify the risks in your area.(3) 2. Prepare an emergency plan based on these risks and your own capacities (or if you live in a facility, find out about their emergency plan).(4) 3. Prepare an emergency kit that will allow you to be self-sufficient during the first 72 hours of an emergency.(5) 4. Form a personal support network of at least three people you know, trust, and can help in an emergency.(6)""]"

Modern times have brought new ways of getting around, leading many of us to be much less active than our ancestors (1). Older adults in Canada are more likely than any other age group to live a sedentary lifestyle (2). These days, nearly 70% of people aged 65 to 74 get around by car most of the time, while 5% use public transit. Even fewer – 3% – bike or walk as their primary mode of transportation (3).Despite its waning popularity among older adults, walking has many positives. Here are four research-based examples of the health benefits of walking, with two additional tips on how to enhance how you engage in this activity. Click on the links for more information about recent research and study findings. In older adults who were previously inactive, walking for 20-60 minutes per day, 2-7 days per week canreduce some risk factors for heart disease– including body fat, blood pressure, body mass index, and body weight (4;5). Walking groupscan also provide great opportunities to socialize and increase motivation to be more physically active (6). For older people with chronic conditions like arthritis, dementia, depression, and Parkinson’s disease, walking in groups can improve blood pressure, heart rate, body fat, fitness, walking speed, and reduce symptoms of depression (7). One to 6 months after a stroke, walking training (including musical feedback and treadmill training) can help toimprove walking speed and distancemore than traditional walking training. Six or more months after a stroke, any type of walking training helps improve walking ability, speed, and distance. Additionally, walking training may assist in improving people’s self-care abilities post-stroke (8). For people with chronic musculoskeletal pain, walking canimprove painfor up to one year. In fact, walking provides more effective pain relief than other common interventions such as education, usual care, other exercise, relaxation, or massage. Walking can also improve overall physical function in chronic pain sufferers (9).So, here are a few tips to incorporate walking into your everyday life! Nordic walkinguses poles like those used in cross-country skiing. This style of walking may provide a better total body workout than regular walking because it incorporates the arms and upper body (10). It also increases cardiac fitness despite being perceived as less challenging (10), and burns more calories (11). Musiccan also provide a great boost to your walking routine. Without thinking about it, you may find yourself stepping up the pace to keep up with the beat. Before you know it, you may be walking with greater speed, stride length, rhythm, and symmetry than ever before (12;13).If you want to stay healthy and mobile well into old age, lace up those shoes and put one foot in front of the other. Walking is a great way to boost your health!']"

No matter our age, we all have social needs – whether it’s the need to be loved, to be accepted by our peers, or to belong to a community. Satisfying these social needs can improve your quality of life and help protect against illnesses and depression. As we age, our social priorities and needs can change. They can also be more difficult to fulfill due to health problems, mobility challenges and a shrinking social network, which may contribute to the feelings of loneliness and social isolation experienced by many older adults.(1; 2) A recent systematic review of 14 studies examined the social needs of people over 65 and identified ways to contribute to their well-being.(3) This systematic review identified four main themes: 1) a diversity of needs; 2) the need for proximity; 3) the need for meaningful relationships; and 4) the need for reciprocity. A diversity of needs Research evidence reveals that not all older adults have the same social needs; there are individual and cultural differences. Some cultures may be more supportive of (and actively engage) their elders than others. Also, not everyone feels the need to have an extensive social network in order to be happy. It must be remembered that social needs are rooted in the personalities, desires, expectations and cultures of older adults. The need for proximity As we age, our social network often becomes less extensive and the frequency of contact with friends and loved ones tends to decrease. While relationships with close friends or family members are important, relationships with neighbours and other members of the community also play significant roles. Having a support network that is close by will contribute to older adults’ feelings of safety, comfort and connectivity. The need for meaningful relationships Meaningful social relationships help to provide affection, as well as a sense of purpose and respect. Research evidence shows the importance of social networks, which includes family, friends, neighbours and community members. Even casual conversations with strangers can fulfill some social needs of older adults and contribute to their well-being. A tight social network can be greatly beneficial to older adults by supporting their well-being and helping them maintain their independence. That being said, older adults are generally afraid of becoming a burden to their friends and loved ones (or being perceived as such). The need for reciprocity Reciprocity relates to both proximity and meaningful relationships: a relationship seems stronger when there is some reciprocity. Reciprocity means not only receiving from others, but also offering support and friendship, helping others and contributing to society (whether by volunteering or helping neighbours). Feeling useful is an important contributor to older adults’ sense of independence and purpose. In light of these findings, it is possible to draw some recommendations to address the social needs of older adults: - Consider individual and cultural differences while developing and implementing interventions to address the social needs of older adults. Everyone does not have the same social needs. - Encourage older adults to engage in volunteer activities that put their talents and expertise to work, which will nurture their sense of purpose and of belonging to a community. - Focus should also be put on interventions that encourage older adults’ social connections and engagement. Community hubs providing a central access point for a range of cultural and recreational programs and services (such as public libraries) can be particularly promising to address their need for meaningful relationships with people nearby.(4)']"

This unexpected turn of events can leave you with more than just bruises. A fall can also have lasting psychological effects, manifesting into a fear of falling again.For Canadian seniors, falls remain the leading cause of injury-related hospitalizations (1), so a fear of falling is not unfounded. In Canada, 34% of older adults report being concerned about falling (2), and this fear is most common in those who have hit the ground recently (3).A fear of falling can lead people to play it safe – older adults will often go out less often and participate in fewer activities (3), leading to less social interaction and a lower quality of life (4;5). A fear of falling can also lead to poor balance (5), and may even change the way a person walks (6). The irony is that playing it safe creates a circular problem in which a fear of falling becomes a risk factor for future falls (4).Many studies have examined ways to ease the fear of falling, with interventions such as fall-related programs that focus on multiple components and risk factors, tai chi, and exercise, in particular, showing promise (7).More recently, studies have examined whether cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) reduces fear of falling in older adults. CBT aims to change how a person thinks (“cognitive”) and acts (“behavior”), which can markedly improve how they feel. This approach can help people overcome their fear of falling by shifting their focus from pessimistic thoughts to things they can do – such as exercise – to lower their risk of falling. This shift in focus encourages people to safely increase their daily activity level (8). Arecentsystematic reviewandmeta analysislooked at CBT delivered in groups or privately, either in person or over the phone. CBT sessions lasted between 4 and 20 weeks and included goal-setting and promoting physical activity. This review found that CBT may lower the risk of falling and improve balance by small amounts in people 60 years of age or over who live at home. For risk of falling, effects began immediately after therapy ended and lasted for 6-12 months, while for balance effects were not immediate and only seen within 6 months of treatment ending. It also appears that individual CBT may produce stronger effects than CBT done in groups. These findings suggest that CBT is a promising strategy for addressing fear of falling among older adults. But despite the positive results, more research is needed owing to the small number of studies included, exclusion of older adults with certain health conditions, and variability among the CBTs used in the different studies (8).If past falls have filled your mind with worries, CBT may be a useful technique to help you quell these doubts, and encourage you to move around with confidence once again!']"

However, there seem to be taboos and preconceived ideas about the sexuality of older adults. Sexuality is defined by the World Health Organization as encompassing sex, gender identities and roles, sexual orientation, eroticism, pleasure, intimacy and reproduction.(1) Sexuality can be influenced by the interaction of biological, psychological, social, economic, political, cultural, ethical, legal, historical, religious and spiritual factors.A recent systematic review examined the attitudes and concerns of seniors over 60 in relation to their sexuality.(1) The review identified three main themes: 1) social conventions make it difficult for older adults to express their sexuality; 2) your health (and not age) affects sexuality; and 3) sexuality is often viewed narrowly as the sexual act. The systematic review revealed that older adults have the impression that most people assume that they are asexual and thus, they often feel sexually invisible. Society seems to value a sexuality that flourishes in youth and beauty. Older adults who internalize these values and norms are often ashamed of their bodies, and are less likely to express their sexual needs and desires for fear of being judged and excluded.Older adults also reported gender stereotypes that persist: older women expressing sexual desires appear to be subjected to negative social judgments, unlike older men who see their sexuality legitimized by the sale of drugs to improve their erectile capacities and allow them to ""function normally."" The systematic review also highlighted that health, not age, is what has a true impact on sexuality. Older adults who have physical limitations or have certain health conditions reported having a lower ability to engage in sexual activity. Some may take medications, which can alter their ability to have and enjoy sex. Some reported that they were confronted by stereotypical and narrow views when they approached their doctors to discuss sexual problems. Not surprisingly, older adults who face these attitudes from their healthcare providers feel that they do not receive appropriate counselling or care. The last theme that emerged from the systematic review is that older adults often narrowly define sexuality as sexual intercourse. The loss or decrease in sexual function can thus cause distress, disappointment, frustration and despair among older adults when they fail to experience this so-called ""normal"" sexuality. However, older adults facing health problems that affect sexual function tend to adopt broader definitions of sexuality and sexual activity. There are many different ways to be intimate and to express your sexuality. Some older adults may choose not to engage in sexual activity, and that is also normal.(2) Regardless of how you choose to be intimate, here are a few things to keep in mind:- There are normal changes related to aging that may cause sexual problems, but some sexual problems are not related to aging. Talk to your doctor when in doubt.(2; 3)- Age does not protect you and your partner from sexually transmitted diseases. Take steps to protect yourself.(2; 3)- Talk with your partner to better understand their needs and desires, and to explore the different facets of sexuality and intimacy.(2; 3) And let’s keep the conversation going. We all need to get over the taboos about the sexual life of older adults.']"

If so, you may have witnessed tai chi or ba duan jin, a sort of meditation in motion, and two ancient practices in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) (1).TCM has been practiced in China for over 2000 years (2). It is based on two main theories. The Yin-Yang theory describes everything as being made up of complementary opposites (like dark and light, or negative and positive). The Five Elements theory classifies phenomena in terms of five basic processes represented by the elements wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. It contends that there is a link between these elements in the environment and in the human body. A balance between Yin and Yang and the five elements of the universe allows the sustained flow of vital energy, otherwise known as Qi (pronounced Chi). This is needed to maintain or improve the functions of the human body (1;2).Diabetes is a disease that is familiar to millions in Canada (3) and worldwide (4;5). For most people, management of blood sugar levels is the name of the game. But despite the arsenal of treatment options available\xa0— healthy eating, exercise, insulin, oral medications, and blood sugar monitoring (6)\xa0— many people struggle to keep their blood sugar under control (1;7-8).Can age old practices such as tai chi and ba duan jin complement modern medicine’s standard approach to type 2 diabetes care? Asystematic reviewandmeta analysisshowed that TCM-based lifestyle approaches (alongside standard diabetes care) may improve the health of people with type 2 diabetes. Of the different TCM-based lifestyle approaches that were studied, tai chi and ba duan jin produced the most promising results. Although promising, these findings should be taken with caution, as more long-term and high quality studies are needed to better understand how TCM can help people with diabetes (1).Within the review, different styles of tai chi were practiced at least once a week and up to twice daily, and with or without supervision. Overall, it was found that tai chi may reduce fasting blood sugar levels and body mass index, and improve the physical aspect of quality of life (e.g. pain and physical function) (1;9). The greatest benefit for most of these outcomes was seen when tai chi was practiced for at least 150 minutes each week, with additional benefits to average blood sugar levels (Hb1Ac) and the mental aspect of quality of life (e.g. mental health)\xa0also seen at this duration (1).Similarly, ba duan jin sessions occurred at least three times per week and up to twice daily, and were either supervised or unsupervised. Overall, the review indicated that ba duan jin may lower fasting blood sugar and Hb1Ac levels, reduce body mass index, and improve symptoms of depression. The effect on Hb1Ac was most pronounced when ba duan jin was practiced for at least 150 minutes per week (1).If you are struggling to control your diabetes, you may want to consider adding tai chi or ba duan jin to your standard diabetes care routine.']"

Caring for a loved one can be challenging: scheduling medical appointments, ensuring they take their medication as prescribed, managing their finances and paying their bills, making sure there is food in the fridge, providing emotional support, making sure they are happy and safe... Caregivers play many significant roles, which can be particularly complex when they have to be accomplished remotely.According to Statistics Canada, more than 8 million Canadians provide care to a friend or loved one with a chronic health condition or disability.(1; 2) It is estimated that approximately 12% of family caregivers provide support to a family member who lives at least an hour away by car.(2)  If you are one of these long-distance caregivers, it’s important to realize that you are not alone. There is limited research evidence allowing us to paint a clear picture of long-distance caregivers.(2; 3) That being said, there appears to be a similar proportion of men and women who play the role of long-distance caregivers. Most of them have to juggle between their professional and caregiving responsibilities. They often come from smaller families and must share care responsibilities with professionals from the public and private sectors.Studies have found that, despite the distance separating them from their loved ones, long-distance caregivers provide the same types of support as caregivers living nearby.(3) This is particularly the case with regard to the maintenance of the house, planning medical appointments and coordinating follow-up care, providing temporary respite for local caregivers, managing finances, and preparing meals when visiting. This can be explained by the fact that these distant caregivers sometimes visit their loved ones for a few days at a time, and that they take advantage of these extended stays to accomplish more tasks. Yet, distance seems to complicate their role as caregivers, particularly with respect to sharing information about the care needs of their loved ones.On the financial side, studies indicate that being a long-distance caregiver increases the likelihood of making significant financial contributions.(3) Such financial contributions are sometimes a way for long-distance caregivers to show that they care.\xa0Nevertheless, long-distance caregivers are not more likely to receive financial assistance from government programs or to receive more tax credits.Studies on the experiences of long-distance caregivers have also examined what impact it has on their well-being. These studies appear to contradict the expression: ""out of sight, out of mind”. In fact, geographical separation seems to exacerbate stressors for caregivers.(3) Long-distance caregivers experience stress levels as high as local caregivers providing care to people with dementia. Finally, despite the similarity in the proportion of men and women who are long-distance caregivers, gender inequalities persist: career sacrifices, family conflicts and emotional distress seem more frequent among women. According to the U.S. National Institute on Aging,(4; 5) long-distance caregivers can play a number of crucial roles for their loved ones, including: And remember: your role as a long-distance caregiver will evolve over time, and will need to be aligned with the evolving needs of your loved ones.']"

Fall prevention for seniors living in the community,"['For older adults, the risk of falling is very real. In fact, nearly 20% of older adults in Canada who live at home reported at least one fall in 2008/2009, while over 250,000 reported an injury related to falls in 2009/2010 (1).There are many reasons why older adults fall, including chronic conditions, balance problems, poor vision, cognitive impairment, side effects from medications, improper footwear, and previous falls. With so many factors threatening to knock older adults off their feet, the fear of falling is no laughing matter. Fortunately, there are things you can do to keep your feet safely on the ground. Exercise, for example, is well known to prevent falls inlong-term carehomes (2;3). But what can exercise do for the 92% of older adults in Canada living independently in the community (4)? It turns out that exercise – alone or in combination with other strategies – can help reduce the chance that older adults living in the community will fall (4;5).Onesystematic reviewfound that exercise alone – carried out 3 times per week for about 12 months– may lower the risk of falls generally, and specifically falls that lead to injuries. Most studies evaluated strategies focused on improving walking speed, balance, and muscle strength. Beneficial exercises included tai chi, resistance training, and exercises aimed at improving flexibility. While exercise was sometimes associated with minor pain, bruising, or fall-related injuries/fractures, it did not increase the risk of serious injuries (5).Anothersystematic reviewandmeta analysisalso showed that exercise alone or combined with other strategies prevented falls (6;7), and particularly falls leading to injuries. Strategies such as orthotics, hip protectors, patient quality improvement initiatives (i.e. self-management, education), and environmental assessment and modification activities, when combined with exercise, were all found to reduce the risk of experiencing a fall. More so, the risk of more serious falls leading to injury was reduced when exercise was combined with vision tests and treatment, and when these two strategies were combined with efforts to eliminate risk factors from one’s environment. Unfortunately, the results of the review also indicated that exercise combined with certain strategies could lead to an increased risk of falling, as well as increased risk of an injury as a result of a fall. This heightened risk in some individuals could stem from their increased ability to move around as a result of exercising, however, any risk should be balanced with the need to improve mobility (6).For older adults still living at home, falling should not be considered inevitable. There are many things you can do to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground. Exercise may be an excellent option, but you should speak with your health care provider, and consider your own values and preferences, when deciding which strategy is best for you.']"

And yet, our social networks tend to shrink as we get older, which can lead to loneliness. Loneliness can be transient and associated with significant life events, but it can also be aggravated when our physical and cognitive abilities prevent us from socializing. Loneliness can have serious health consequences, partly because it promotes a sedentary lifestyle. It is an equally important risk factor for premature death as smoking, obesity or lack of physical activity.(1)But coping with loneliness is not easy. Are companion animals part of the solution? Many studies have examined the effects of companion animals and animal-assisted therapies on the health of older adults. These studies looked at the effects of dogs, cats, birds, fishes and even interactive robot-seals! These studies generally reveal that companion animals and animal-assisted therapies can improve the physical, emotional and social well-being of older adults. Some studies show that pets help relieve stress and anxiety, reduce blood pressure, emotionally stimulate older adults, promote memories of past experiences, encourage older adults to move and stay active, and improve difficult behaviours of people living with Alzheimer and dementia.(2)Some studies have also examined the effectiveness of companion animals to alleviate loneliness among older adults. A systematic review revealed that there are still few methodologically sound studies that have examined this issue, but there is evidence that animal-assisted therapies are promising for reducing loneliness (although this positive effect may be due to some aspects of the therapies rather than to the animals). (3) Other studies also highlighted that animals can help older adults feel useful (and have a sense of purpose), encourage them to talk, encourage loving physical contact, and act as a social catalyst to help connect and talk to others. It has also been demonstrated that the presence of animals can make a positive difference in bereavement and ease the transition to a new home (events that usually exacerbate loneliness among older adults).(4)Animals have the potential to be faithful companions in our old age. But the decision to adopt or offer a companion animal should not be taken lightly. It is important to consider the needs and capacities of older adults to care for these animals, but also the risks associated with the presence of animals (whether it is the risk of falls if the older adults are frail and have balance problems, as well as the risk of bites or infections). The loss of a companion animal (whether following the death of the animal or the placement of the older adult in a residence that does not accept animals) can generate distress among older adults. The possibility of having a companion animal should therefore be considered in the assessment before entering a residence or care facility. The animal may represent a relationship with a deceased spouse, a valuable source of companionship and emotional support, as well as a life choice for the older adult.(4) We must therefore proceed with love and respect with these companion animals.']"

On a positive note, cognition is not always a downward slide. While processing speed and memory may get worse with age in some people, well-practiced and familiar things like vocabulary often hold steady, or may even improve as the years go by (3). With that said, any changes in cognitive function should be discussed with a health care provider, in part because they may be an early symptom of dementia (2).Cognitive changes can affect our everyday lives, even in the absence of diseases like dementia. For example, older adults with impaired cognitive function are more likely to: fall; and struggle to take care of themselves, communicate effectively with their health care providers, and take medications as prescribed (2).Fortunately, lifestyle can influence the cognitive changes that come with age – giving us the power to do things that help keep our minds healthy (4). One major point of discussion has been the benefit of physical exercise on cognitive function (1).But before lacing up those running shoes or rolling out that yoga mat, take a look at what the benefits are, and what kind and how much exercise you need to do to give your brain a boost. A recentsystematic reviewandmeta analysisfound that supervised physical activity can improve cognitive function in men and women over the age of 50. This improvement was seen across the board – meaning it did not matter whether a person’s cognitive function was already mildly impaired or not. Many types of physical activity appeared to be effective, including aerobic exercise, resistance training, and a combination of the two. While the findings for tai chi were also promising, more research is needed to confirm if tai chi is an effective strategy. Yoga, however, was not found to have an effect on cognitive function.Overall, people who engaged in physical activity had better attention, executive function, memory, and working (short-term) memory. However, the impact on cognitive function differed according to exercise type, duration and intensity, as well as the specific area of cognition being looked at. For instance, it was found that resistance training may be especially effective for improving executive function, memory, and working memory, while tai chi improves working memory only. Although a variety of exercise types were successful, combined aerobic exercise and resistance training could be of most benefit, as could exercising at or above moderate intensity for 45-60 minutes. Interestingly, how often you exercise (i.e. frequency) and the total number of weeks you exercise for may not matter. In fact, positive benefits were seen across all exercise frequencies (low-high) and total number of weeks of exercise completed (short-long) (2).Exercise is a great way to keep the body fit and healthy. If that isn’t enough motivation to get you moving, the possible added benefit to your cognitive function just might!']"

Whether the danger is real or not, fear of crime is associated with negative effects on health and well-being, regardless of age.(3) This fear can be amplified among older adults who are vulnerable, frail, socially isolated, and who no longer benefit from the same family and community support they had in their younger years. This fear can exacerbate physical and mental health problems by forcing older adults to reduce outdoor activities and by isolating themselves\xa0even\xa0further.No one should be living in fear, but what can be done to alleviate this fear? Is it possible to reduce crime in the community and the fear of crime, without the need for police interventions? There are more and more local strategies where community members take on an active role in monitoring criminal activities, as well as educational roles to raise awareness about crime prevention among community members. Neighbourhood watch is a very common community-based intervention aimed at preventing delinquency and burglaries. Having emerged in the late 1960s in the United States, neighbourhood surveillance has gained popularity in Canada and Australia, but also in Germany and France. A neighbourhood watch program is often implemented with other complementary interventions – such as encouraging people to mark their valuable assets or to conduct risk assessment of their homes to make appropriate security changes. A systematic review revealed that neighbourhood watch is generally effective in reducing crime, with the reduction ranging from 16% to 26% depending on the studies.(4) Yet, neighbourhood watch has been the subject of severe criticism in recent years, particularly in the United States. Overzealous and aggressive members of neighbourhood watch groups have committed acts of violence against innocent victims. Such highly publicized events suggest that a neighbourhood watch may also have undesirable effects, such as nurturing some people’s feeling of insecurity and fuelling tensions in some communities.Other studies have looked at the impacts of interventions targeting the built environment (that is, any element in the physical environment that has been built such as streets, buildings and infrastructures). A systematic review revealed that some environmental interventions may reduce the fear of crime, but the evidence was not always conclusive.(3) Interventions to improve home security (for example, the use of a telecare intervention for older people in sheltered housing, or improvements to lighting, landscaping and driveways at someone’s home) and small-scale improvements in public spaces (for example, installing new training equipment in parks, or cleaning and repainting bus stations) were the most promising interventions for reducing the fear of crime. The evidence was inconclusive as to the effectiveness of multi-component interventions (for example, improving lighting, installing video surveillance using closed-circuit television systems, improving landscaping and removing graffiti in the neighbourhood). Studies focusing on the use of video surveillance using closed-circuit television systems revealed that it is not effective in reducing the fear of crime. Programs to relocate residents to ‘safer’ neighbourhoods were not effective at all. In fact, relocation seemed to increase the fear of crime. This could be explained by the fact that such relocation negatively affected people's social networks, thus increasing their sense of isolation and their fear of crime. It should be noted that the effect of these interventions may depend on age, but the findings were not conclusive about which interventions were most effective among older adults.One key lesson from the research evidence is that the social aspect remains essential. It is important to act as a community to reduce crime and to reinforce a sense of security among older adults (who are too often socially isolated). Look out for your older neighbours. Let them know that they can count on you. If you are a caregiver, ask your loved ones about their sense of security in their home and neighbourhood.The built environment also matters. Conduct a risk assessment to identify modifications that could be made to the homes of your loved ones to increase their sense of security, as well as modifications that could be made in their neighbourhoods. Bring these issues up to your municipal representatives. A growing number of cities and communities worldwide are striving to better meet the needs of their older residents. The World Health Organization\xa0Global Network\xa0for\xa0Age-friendly Cities\xa0and\xa0Communities developed guidelines to create age-friendly environments that can contribute to older adults’ sense of security.(5)""]"

Similarly, the growing worldwide epidemic of type 2 diabetes has also been in the spotlight – with an estimated 400 million people affected currently, and this number expected to be 642 million by 2040 (1;2). As type 2 diabetes rates continue to soar, there is an urgent need to find effective ways to tackle this disease. Vitamin D supplementation has emerged as a possible solution (1). But how effective is it really?Known as the “sunshine vitamin”, vitamin D is created in your skin in response to direct sunlight (3;4;5). However, the amount of vitamin D created can be hindered by a variety of factors including cloud cover, time of day, and smog (3). Vitamin D is also found in small amounts in some foods such as oily fish (mackerel, sardines and tuna) (3;4;5), as well as foods fortified with vitamin D such as dairy products, breakfast cereal, and orange juice (3). Most foods however, are not a great source of vitamin D (3;4;5), which has resulted in many taking supplements to boost their vitamin D levels. In fact, almost 34% of Canadians took some kind of supplement that contained vitamin D in 2015 (6).Many people with diabetes are low in vitamin D (7). This is an important finding because vitamin D is known to help regulate insulin levels (8). New studies have assessed if vitamin D supplementation helps in the management of type 2 diabetes (1). A recentsystematic reviewandmeta analysisexplored whether vitamin D supplementation improved blood sugar control in adults with type 2 diabetes. Studies included in the review administered vitamin D at varying doses, frequencies, and lengths of time, and in different forms such as tablets, drinks, and injections.The findings of the review indicated that overall, average blood sugar levels may be reduced with vitamin D supplementation, but not fasting blood sugar levels. However, these effects were not consistent across all participants. For example, individuals who were non-obese seemed to experience improvements in average blood sugar levels, while individuals with a vitamin D deficiency, as well as those who were both non-obese and deficient in vitamin D seemed to experience reductions in both average and fasting blood sugar levels. People with type 2 diabetes who were obese or not classified as vitamin D deficient did not experience benefits with supplementation.When it comes to blood sugar control, adults with type 2 diabetes who were deficient in vitamin D and who were of a healthy weight were likely to benefit the most from vitamin D supplementation. The greatest effects occurred when supplements were taken for longer than 12 weeks and at a dose of ≥ 1000 IU per day. While more research is still needed to confirm these results, currently there is reason to believe that vitamin D can have a role to play in managing type 2 diabetes for some people (1).']"

Alone or in groups, older adults often engage in art, music, crafts and other creative activities. With more free time, many people see retirement as an opportunity to finally get back to their artistic passions.The field of arts and health has been a thriving research sector for several decades.(1) Many arts and crafts activities are offered in nursing homes and other healthcare settings to promote health and prevent illness among older patients. Art therapy is gaining popularity because of the potential of artistic expression and creativity among patients to contribute to psychotherapeutic or personal development purposes.(2; 3) For example, many clinical studies have highlighted the positive effects of music to improve the physical and mental health of older adults with dementia and their caregivers,(4; 5) to reduce depression, and to improve physical function and quality of life for people who have had a stroke,(2) and to improve the health of people with mental health conditions.(3)Taking part in any of these artistic activities may also be beneficial for older adults living in the community. Studies examining the quality of life of older adults have looked at the effects of various participatory forms of art (rather than older adults being mere spectators), including singing and music, crafts, painting and drawing, dance, theatre, creative writing, photography and film. Interestingly, these studies have not defined ""quality of life"" in the same way.(1) Some have focused on the physical and mental health of older adults, their social interactions, their ability to learn new things, their cognitive abilities, or their level of creativity. Few studies have examined the comparative effectiveness of these different artistic activities.(1) That being said, research evidence shows the positive effects on the health and well-being of older adults, their memory, their level of creativity, their ability to solve problems, their ability to carry out daily activities, and their reaction time, but also the capacity of participatory arts to reduce loneliness and social isolation.(1; 6; 7) Some studies also reveal that arts and crafts can foster more harmonious intergenerational relationships,(8) which may help to promote linguistic and cultural heritage (particularly for older adults living in linguistic and cultural minority situations).Studies have also examined the effects of museum programs specifically designed for older adults. These may include reminiscence programs (for example, facilitating group discussions about personal memories, sometimes using some artwork or boxes of museum objects available for loan), storytelling programs (for example, writing prose or poetry using stimuli such as memories, music, objects, or images), or lectures specifically for elderly audiences. Research evidence shows that these museum programs can increase socialization and improve the mood of older adults.(9) Art may not be a panacea, but it looks promising to improve the health and well-being of older adults. It may be time to wake the artist inside you. Dust off the camera or the piano. If you are a caregiver, encourage your loved ones to pursue their artistic passions. Put their paint brushes within reach to facilitate their use. You could also promote (or participate in) arts and crafts activities in your community. Check out your local museums for activities dedicated to older adults. If nothing is currently offered in your community, why not join your local museum as a volunteer to help them develop such programs? To do so, many toolkits exist that can provide guidance about how to plan and support artistic activities in your community.(10; 11; 12)']"

With your treatment behind you, you may find yourself looking towards the next phase of your journey – staying healthy and cancer-free.Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, globally (1;2). Within Canada, it is the third-most commonly diagnosed cancer, accounting for 25% of all cancer diagnoses in females (3).Women with breast cancer can face many challenges stemming from the cancer itself or the treatment that comes along with it. These include: damage to the heart muscle and structure and functioning of the nervous system, weight gain, changes in self-esteem and sexual functioning, early menopause, having a hard time sleeping, feeling tired, swelling, leukemia, and infertility (2;4;5;6;7). There are many strategies and services available that can help you manage these challenges, so talk to your doctor about any concerns that you have. One topic worth discussing is exercise, and how it might help you on your road to recovery.The benefits of exercise are well known. Exercise can help keep yourbones healthy, improveblood sugar control, treatdepression, buildmuscle strengthand more. But what if you’ve undergone treatment for breast cancer? Is there evidence to suggest that exercise can combat some of the mental and physical challenges that accompany the disease and its treatment? Furthermore, does exercise reduce the chance of the cancer returning? New research has explored these questions (2). A recentsystematic reviewconsidered the effects of many different types of exercise including: aerobic exercise such as walking, cycling, or dancing; resistance training such as weight-based exercises; or a combination of both. On average, exercise programs lasted 8-12 weeks for sessions of one hour, with sessions usually occurring at least 3 times per week. Women completed these programs in groups, alone at home, or a combination of the two.So, let’s cut right to the chase. Unfortunately, due to a lack of high quality research it is unclear if exercise reduces your risk of cancer recurrence, or your risk of dying from the disease.But there is some good news! The review found that exercise could have benefits among women with breast cancer after they have completed chemotherapy and/or radiation. In the short term, exercise may increase quality of life by a small to moderate amount, while also possibly improving emotional well-being, anxiety, fitness, and perceptions of one’s physical functioning. If you exercise over a longer period of time, you may also start to feel less tired and feel motivated to exercise more, which can help maintain fitness improvements. What’s more, exercise after breast cancer treatment doesn’t appear to have much of a downside, with the review reporting few minor side effects such as discomfort and stiffness (2).Though the jury’s still out on the relationship between exercise and breast cancer death and recurrence, going out for a walk, getting on that bike, or picking up those weights may lead to physical and mental health benefits.']"
192,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/09/12/fiscal-measures-to-support-older-adults-and-reduce-poverty,12 September 2018,Fiscal measures to support older adults and reduce poverty,"[""According to Statistics Canada, Canada ranks 12th among Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries with an average poverty rate of 14.3% for older adults (ranging from 4.1% in Alberta to 26.7% in Newfoundland and Labrador).(1) Poverty reduction measures are an important approach to improving health and well-being. Although the number of low-income older adults in Canada has declined since 1976, the fact remains that older adults are more likely to be at the bottom of the income distribution ladder. Living in poverty is of particular concern to older adults, given the challenges associated with aging (for example, having multiple chronic conditions, the loss of autonomy, and reduced access to social and community support). Tax credits and benefits are often proposed to reduce the tax burden on older adults and, hopefully, reduce poverty among older adults.(1)At the provincial and territorial level, tax credits and benefits vary widely. There are tax credits for expenses incurred by older adults to maintain their independence, tax credits for home support, credits for older adults living alone, deductions for retirement income transferred to spouses, and many housing-related measures (including older adults' housing benefit programs, and renovation credits to help older adults age at home).At the federal level, the Old Age Security program is the largest pension plan offered by the Government of Canada. In addition to the Old Age Security program, other types of federal tax credits and benefits are available. - Guaranteed Income Supplement >> a non-taxable monthly benefit available to Old Age Security recipients who have low incomes. - Survivor Allowance >> a benefit available to people aged 60 to 64 who have low incomes and whose spouse is deceased. - Canada Pension Plan >> a program to provide contributors and their families with partial income replacement in the event of retirement, disability or death. - Registered pension plan >> an arrangement offered by an employer or a union that provides pension benefits in the form of periodic payments to retired employees. - Retirement savings plan >> a savings plan that allows the tax payment on contributions to be deferred to a future year and accumulates tax-sheltered capital. - Pension income splitting >> an arrangement whereby a person splits his or her eligible pension income with their spouse in order to reduce their taxes. - Other tax incentives, including tax credits, deductions and exemptions related to public transit or home renovations. Although several fiscal measures are proposed to reduce poverty among older adults, there is limited research evidence about their effectiveness.A recent rapid synthesis (a synthesis of research evidence done in a short period of time, but in a systematic and transparent way) found that there are few systematic reviews examining the effectiveness of fiscal measures in reducing poverty among older adults.(1) However, studies show that increasing the age of eligibility for Canada's tax benefits from 65 to 67 years of age would have a negative effect on the health of low-income older adults, and increase the percentage of low-income people, particularly women. Women are more likely to have precarious jobs and generally earn lower wages than men. They often have to act as caregivers, more often head single-parent families, and are more burdened with family management, which reduces their years in the workforce and therefore their retirement benefits. Research also reveals that changes to the Canada Pension Plan may affect the generosity of employers in contributing to registered pension plans. Finally, since retirement income is not all taxed in the same way, an increase in pension income may increase the marginal tax rate that could result in the loss of benefits for some older adults.Looking at international studies, a recent systematic review found that social pension plans (giving regular payments to older adults) have a protective effect for older adults and are associated with better health outcomes for older adults living in poverty.(2) In addition, social pension plans seem more effective at reducing poverty among older adults than social-housing measures. However, the authors of the systematic review were unable to determine which social pension plan is the most effective (universal pension plans that can be claimed by all older adults, regardless of their wealth, or pension plans available only to older adults with income below a certain level). Finding the fiscal measures to which you are entitled can make you dizzy! And understanding whether you are eligible for your particular situation (for example, your age, your family situation, your health status) makes things even more complex. Tax professionals, such as accountants, can help you navigate the fiscal system. There is also a simple tool developed by the Government of Canada that allows you to obtain a personalized list of benefits to which you may be eligible:http://www.canadabenefits.gc.ca/""]"

Once thought to be a disease of the wealthy brought on by too much rich food and drink, gout is now recognized to affect people from all walks of life.(1) Today, around five percent of Canadian men and two percent of Canadian women have gout.(2)Gout is a type of arthritis that is caused by a surplus of uric acid in the body.(1;3) This excess can trigger the formation of urate crystals in joints, cartilage, tendons, and bones, causing inflammation, swelling, and pain.(3)Gout flare-ups can be sudden (1) and can increase in frequency, length, and severity in certain people.(3) For some, gout is so severe that it can interfere with everyday activities, work, and family life. It also contributes to multiple doctors visits or even visits to the emergency department.(4)While many associate gout with being overweight – and this does increase your risk (5) – gout is also linked to kidney disease (6), drinking large amounts of alcohol (7), and eating foods that are high in purines (e.g. meats, seafood, peas, beans, lentils, spinach).(8) Risk for the disease increases with age; and males are at a higher risk than females.(1;2)New research has explored the best ways to treat a gout attack. The findings of asystematic review– which align with recommendations in a practice guideline for doctors – determined that several medications are effective in reducing pain from a gout attack, but each comes with specific side effects. While colchicine reduces pain from gout, even in low doses, its common side effects include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and cramps.(3;9) Comparison of different nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to one another (3) or to steroids (3;10) found they have similar effectiveness in reducing pain, however steroids produce fewer stomach and intestine related side effects, whileNSAIDscause fewer skin related issues such as a rash.(3;9)In addition to pain relief, it was found that some medications likefebuxostatandallopurinolcan lower urate levels and prevent future gout episodes when used long-term.(3) A doctor may recommend this treatment for people who get gout frequently. These medications should not be used, however, after an initial attack of gout or in people who do not get gout often.(3;9)The current evidence does not support non-drug treatments like traditional Chinese medicine, and changes to lifestyle and diet.(3)If gout has made an unwelcome appearance in your life, speak with your health care provider about what treatment is best for you. You should discuss the possible benefits, risks, and cost of each medication, as well as your preferences.']"

Opinions differ on the major transformations that many neighbourhoods are experiencing.Some use the term ""gentrification"" to illustrate this urban phenomenon. Gentrification is a phenomenon whereby wealthier people appropriate a space initially occupied by less privileged residents or users, thus transforming the neighbourhood\'s social and economic profile.(1; 2) Older, more affordable neighbourhoods then see an influx of middle- and upper-class people, as well as new businesses to serve them. This often has the effect of increasing rents, mortgages and property taxes, forcing some long-time residents, including elderly people, to relocate.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, gentrification is a complex issue that can change the history, culture and social fabric of a community. Some groups may be at increased risk for the negative consequences of gentrification, including the poor, women, ethnocultural minorities, and the elderly. Gentrification can exacerbate health problems among these vulnerable groups, by limiting their access to needed services (for example, access to health and social services, transportation choices, healthy food choices), affecting their social networks, and increasing their level of stress.(3)Is it possible to control the negative impacts of gentrification and make it socially acceptable? A recent systematic review examined strategies to control or mitigate the displacement of vulnerable populations when their neighbourhood is being gentrified.(4) This systematic review included studies published from 1980 to 2016. It covered a total of 64 studies on the gentrification and displacement of low-income populations in many countries around the world.While the quality of this systematic review remains limited, it does describe three types of strategies that have been used to control or mitigate the negative impacts of gentrification: measures to protect tenants, measures to control land ownership and development projects, and measures to nurture community empowerment. Measures to protect tenants Various strategies have been put in place here and abroad to mitigate the impacts of gentrification on existing tenants. These include rent subsidies for low-income tenants, rent controls, rents that vary according to income, and tax exemptions for homeowners to fill the gap between rent increases and what tenants can pay. In some countries, owners are obligated to offer the property to the tenants before putting it up for sale (also called first right of purchase or right of first refusal). Also, government assistance for the purchase or renovation can be offered. In addition, some low-income people can still get a loan to buy, which allows them to afford a higher mortgage while maintaining their standard of living. Some jurisdictions have also adopted laws against harassment to protect tenants who were threatened with eviction.When moving is inevitable, relocation assistance has been offered by some jurisdictions. Interestingly, from 1970 to 1995, the city of Washington, D.C., used a lottery system to sell abandoned properties at a very low price to low-income residents, and supported them with special mortgages that they could start to pay 10 years later. Measures to control land ownership and development projects Zoning-related strategies (for example, requiring the development of affordable housing and housing cooperatives in new developments, prohibiting the conversion of certain buildings, prohibiting non-owner-occupied housing) and fiscal strategies (for example, luxury housing taxes, progressive property taxes, and taxes to discourage speculative investors from buying and rapidly reselling properties) are commonly used to control land ownership and development projects. Expropriation can also be used as a policy tool to ensure affordable housing by putting private lands in the hands of the government. Measures to nurture community empowerment Finally, the third set of strategies identified aims to empower communities. Mobilizing community members to voice their needs and ideas about new developments, educating local populations about their rights, providing them with legal assistance, and engaging them in decision-making processes regarding land use and urban planning appear to be critical success factors to control the negative impacts of gentrification.While we may not be able to draw firm conclusions about which strategy is most effective, we know that there are many tools available to governments and communities to control the negative impacts of gentrification. And by meaningfully engaging long-time residents early on in the planning process, particularly those who may suffer the most, there may be a chance to make new developments more socially acceptable.']"

Search the internet, and you’ll be flooded with possibilities. One claim that you’re likely to come across is that dietary supplements, including vitamin and mineral supplements, have cancer-fighting abilities. The trick is to figure out which claims are supported by evidence.Selenium is touted to pack an anti-cancer punch.(2) This essential mineral is richly abundant in foods like seafood, organ meats, grains, and dairy products.(3) Despite being important to human health, selenium is reported to be toxic when taken at high doses that surpass the level needed to stay healthy. Additionally, a safe range of selenium consumption has yet to be clearly defined.(4;5) Many Canadians get the nutrients they need from a healthy and balanced diet,(6) and selenium is no exception.(3) Even so, two-thirds of women and one-half of men over the age of 70 – add nutritional supplements like vitamins, minerals, fibre, antacids, and fish oils to their diet, hoping that this will give their health an added boost.(6)When it comes to cancer, can selenium supplements help? Past research on the topic has had conflicting results, while recent research suggests that they may do more harm than good.(2) In the past, studies showed that taking selenium as a supplement helped prevent people from getting cancer. However, a more recentsystematic reviewsuggests that this might not be true. This review looked at many different types of cancer – including head and neck, esophageal, colorectal, liver, skin, lung, breast, bladder, prostate, and blood cancer – and found no evidence that selenium supplements reduced cancer risk. Selenium supplements were also associated with side effects such as an upset stomach. What’s more, some studies found that selenium supplements may increase the risk of prostate cancer, skin issues, and type 2 diabetes. The effects of selenium in people with certain genetic or nutritional backgrounds was not evaluated, but should be a topic of future research.(2)Considering selenium as an addition to your cancer risk reduction routine? You may want to think twice before reaching for this supplement, weighing the potential risks and the lack of evidence to support its use.']"

While poverty affects people of all ages, it presents unique challenges for older adults. Indeed, poverty adds to the challenges of aging, such as growing needs for health and social services, loss of autonomy, reduced mobility, and reduced social and community support. According to Statistics Canada, Canada ranks 12th among OECD countries with an average poverty rate of 14.3% for older adults (ranging from 4.1% in Alberta to 26.7% in Newfoundland and Labrador).(2; 3; 4) Poverty appears to be more prevalent among certain groups of older adults, including those living alone and women.That being said, it is not easy to paint a clear picture of poverty in Canada. Surprisingly, the federal government does not have a formal poverty line, that is, a dollar amount below which a person or a family would be considered ""poor.""(5) In addition, a variety of indicators are used across the country, but these have limitations. Income appears to be the most common indicator. Although this is a starting point, using only income as an indicator does not take into account all dimensions of poverty.(5)For many years, municipal, provincial, territorial and federal governments have expressed their commitment to develop and implement poverty-reduction strategies.(6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11) Various groups and researchers have also proposed new poverty lines and indicators.(12; 13) It is therefore timely to take stock of the indicators that can be used to measure poverty among older adults. A recent systematic review found that the majority of studies have measured poverty among older adults based on income and market-basket indicators.(14) These traditional indicators, however, seem to underestimate the poverty rates among older adults. To a lesser extent, studies have used poverty indicators based on assets or wealth of individuals, as well as indicators illustrating poverty as perceived by older adults (for example, the amount of money perceived as necessary to live in a given community).The systematic review also highlighted some research trends. In fact, studies increasingly focus on measuring poverty among older adults by using a combination of indicators. The purpose is to take into account the different dimensions of poverty and to establish more precise estimates. Other indicators proposed in the studies to measure poverty among older adults include: - the health status of older adults (and their needs for health and social services);- the level of education of older adults, such as the acquisition of skills and knowledge useful for life in society;- the ability of older adults to buy appropriate clothing or shoes;- the level of food security, including older adults’ ability to obtain adequate, healthy and nutritious food, and to eat at least one meal a day containing meat, fish or a vegetarian equivalent;- costs related to accommodation and access to adequate and safe housing, including the ability to connect to the internet or to maintain a proper temperature in their homes;- the level of social inclusion, and the opportunity to travel by car or public transport to participate in activities and community life; and- the characteristics of the communities where older adults live (for example, access to infrastructure and public services).(4; 14)Having an official poverty line and robust indicators are essential for poverty-reduction strategies. Without them, it is not possible for a government to set targets, assess the effectiveness of poverty-reduction interventions, and publicly report on the achievement of these targets.(5) Older adults and their caregivers must make their voices heard at the various levels of government and in poverty studies to develop more relevant, valid and reliable poverty indicators. After all, they know better than anyone the challenges faced by older adults who are trying to make ends meet.']"

After all, it warns us of threats to our well-being. But when pain becomes a long-term issue, it can have a significant impact on our quality of life. The approaching legalization of cannabis – better known as marijuana – in Canada has many wondering if it is a good option for pain relief.Chronic pain is no stranger to many Canadians – nearly 20% of adults live with it on a daily basis (1). Unfortunately, the odds of suffering from chronic pain increase with age, and women are more likely to be affected than men.Neuropathic pain – which arises from damage to the nerves – accounts for about one in five cases of chronic pain (2). Common culprits of this type of pain include accidents, injuries, or surgery, and symptoms or complications of an illness such as diabetes (3). People will often experience sensations like numbness, tingling, jabbing, freezing, or burning (4).Neuropathic pain is also notoriously difficult to treat (2). Medications that are normally prescribed for other types of pain (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatories or opioids) are often ineffective (3). Studies suggest that cannabis may help relieve chronic neuropathic pain (5). But does the evidence stand up to the hype, or are the pain-relieving properties of cannabis all smoke and mirrors? Two compounds in cannabis – THC and CBD – are thought to contribute to cannabis’s ability to relieve pain. THC can alter pain perception by reducing anxiety and stress, while CBD combats pain through its anti-inflammatory action. Cannabis-based medications come in several forms and can by inhaled by pipe or cigarette, or can be taken orally by spray or capsule.A recentsystematic reviewfound that compared to placebo, cannabis-based medications may provide moderate to substantial pain relief, and can reduce pain intensity, sleep problems, and psychological distress (5). Unfortunately, these benefits are often associated with side effects such as sedation, confusion, and psychosis. For some people, these side effects may be severe enough to outweigh cannabis’s pain-relieving benefits.Overall, the quality of the research around cannabis for neuropathic pain relief is low. That is not to say that neuropathic pain sufferers should disregard cannabis as a treatment option – it may work for some, but not for others. The bottom line is that there is currently a lack of good evidence supporting cannabis-based medicines for neuropathic pain relief. More high-quality research is needed to confirm its benefits. New research may be particularly important in older adult populations, and in people with health conditions that predispose them to nerve pain. In the meantime, cannabis may be a useful option for people who fail to get adequate relief from established treatment options (5).']"

They are community hubs, meaning that they provide a central access point for a range of cultural and recreational programs and services, along with health and social programs and services to nurture community life.(1)Over the years, public libraries have developed a diversity of programs and services to meet the evolving needs of older adults. Such programs and services often aim to offer lifelong learning opportunities. A systematic review examining the evolution of public libraries in the United States showed that older adults are quite eager to participate in lifelong learning activities.(2) This review revealed a wide range of topics of interest among older adults, including hobbies, leisure pursuits, humanities, social and international issues, religion, philosophy, arts, technology and health-related issues (such as common health problems, nutrition and stress management).It’s no wonder we see so many older adults going to public libraries to access books, watch movies, listen to music, read newspapers, take classes (for example, language, cooking or computer), and attend workshops and lectures. Older adults who do not have computer equipment at home often go to the library to use what they need – a computer, Wi-Fi, an iPad - and sometimes even access recording studios and 3-D printers. Public libraries often host events where people can discuss with authors and discover local emerging artists. Some libraries also lend, sometimes free of charge, musical instruments, and even passes to visit museums.(3; 4) Many people with a library card can also enjoy a wide range of digital services, including the capacity to access e-books and audiobooks, but also to stream movies.(5)Older adults with mobility issues or lack of access to transportation can also benefit from public libraries. Over the years, innovative outreach programs have been developed by public libraries. For instance, bookmobiles are hitting the streets to serve as mobile libraries to communities without a library branch in their area. These bookmobiles often stop at nursing homes and senior day-care centres.(6)The evolving role of public libraries is also illustrated by the wide range of programs and services to meet the health and social-care needs of older adults and their caregivers. While some public libraries act as one-stop shops for information about health-related topics and existing community services (7), others have individuals on site providing counselling and referrals to community services.(8) Those requiring support and guidance on housing, food, employment, finances, or mental health and addiction can sometimes find help at their public libraries. But of course, not all public libraries have been created equal. Over the years, the Canadian Federation of Library Associations has developed guidelines to support public libraries to design programs and services for older adults and people with disabilities.(9; 10) These guidelines offer some tips for adapting programs and services for this clientele. 1) Get current data on their needs and expectations, and integrate them into the planning and budgeting of activities offered, by setting up a committee of older adults, for example. 2) Make sure their specific needs and interests are reflected in the collections, programs and services offered. Offer ongoing educational programs, including computer and internet classes. 3) Make the facilities accessible, safe and inviting. Ensure that collections dedicated to older adults are easy to access and use visible signage. Plan voice-detection programs, audiobooks or alternative formats, wheelchair ramps and elevators to facilitate access. 4) Make the library a hotspot to access news and information related to aging. Group information about government or community programs and services for older adults and caregivers, for example, or create a dedicated website for this clientele. 5) Plan intergenerational programs, whether in collaboration with local schools or day-care centres. Promote your activities in newspapers, community centres and residences, and engage older adults as volunteers. 6) Some older adults may have mobility and transportation issues, so offer programs outside the library, such as a home-delivery service. 7) Train staff to serve older adults and people with disabilities with politeness and respect. So, having a library card is not just having access to a library collection. It’s having access to a community hub where you can quench your thirst for knowledge, make social connections, and get the help you need!']"

Exercises for your brain might help keep it fit,"['With aging comes the feeling that our brains are not what they used to be. We may lose our car keys more often, leave pasta to boil over on the stove, or forget the name of a person we just met. These brain hiccups can leave us wondering if there are things we can do to stay sharp. It turns out that healthy aging doesn’t just mean moving your body. Exercising your brain is important, too!How well our brain functions changes with age. As we get older, some functions start to decline – such as memory or the speed at which we process information (1).Cognitive function can be divided into four main categories – each category serving a different purpose. Any of these areas can be affected as we grow older, but there are exercises for the brain (e.g. cognitive-based training) that may help delay this age-related brain drain (8). Cognitive-based training aims to maintain cognitive function in older adults, rather than teaching new skills. It can include many different types of activities, such as video games, physical activity, computerized training, learning therapy, visual or auditory tasks, and interactive television-based training.A recentmeta-analysisfound cognitive-based training led to improved overall cognitive function and executive function among healthy older adults. Small gains were also observed in memory, attention, and visual-spatial ability. The training sessions lasted 20 to180 minutes and were carried out one to five days a week for two to 24 weeks. The greatest benefit to executive function occurred when cognitive-based training was done three or more times per week for 24 sessions or more, while training for eight weeks or more resulted in improvement to attention (8).If you’re worried about staying sharp as you age, don’t forget your brain needs “push-ups” too. Cognitive-based training may be just what you need to keep your brain in shape.']"

Developers may want to take advantage of the low cost of land and buildings in these neighbourhoods to bring in new businesses, cafés or rental spaces. The vocation of certain buildings in these neighbourhoods is therefore destined to change. Others are renovated from top to bottom or even demolished to make room for new, more luxurious buildings. Municipal taxes and rents can then increase drastically, forcing less affluent residents and business owners into peripheral areas.Gentrification is defined as an urban phenomenon by which better-off people appropriate space initially occupied by less-privileged residents or users, thus transforming the economic and social profile of the neighbourhood for the benefit of a higher social class.(1; 2)Neighbourhood gentrification can have a significant impact on older adults who often have low and fixed incomes. They often want to live as long as possible in their homes in neighbourhoods where they feel safe. They are used to doing their shopping on foot by walking to local shops, which contributes to their autonomy. Researchers have examined the phenomenon of gentrification to better understand its impact on older adults. Some studies reveal that older adults are more likely to experience exclusion when their neighbourhood is being gentrified.(3; 4) Existing research highlights that exclusion can take seven different forms, which may all contribute to great inequalities. 1) Symbolic exclusion: gentrification can nurture negative stereotypes about older people, but also contribute to their social invisibility.2) Exclusion of identity: gentrification can negate individual identities and reduce them to the identity of the ""elderly"" group alone.3) Socio-political exclusion: gentrification can contribute to a decrease in the participation of older adults in local political bodies, and to their influence on local institutions. Studies revealed that the ""voice"" of the gentrified zone becomes that of the middle class and the professionals who have settled there, a voice that resonates more with that of the local authorities who want to see businesses booming, and remove the unsightly social housing and poverty.4) Institutional exclusion: gentrification can hinder access to services required by older adults.5) Economic exclusion: gentrification can affect the financial resources of older adults by increasing rent, municipal taxes and services, among other things.6) Exclusion from significant social links: gentrification can upset the environment and the social bonds of older adults. Due to declining attendance, it is not uncommon to see churches, community centres, golden age clubs and recreation centres being shut down. These social spaces are some of the few locations where older adults can gather with their peers, discuss, and practice certain activities. Their loss often results in greater isolation of older adults.7) Territorial exclusion: gentrification can confine older adults to smaller spaces in peripheral neighbourhoods. The revitalization of neighbourhoods can bring a wind of positive change: new services, a new energy, new investments, and the rehabilitation of buildings and old houses.(2; 5) However, such revitalization should not contribute to the exclusion of vulnerable populations and their displacement to peripheral areas. Policymakers, community leaders and citizens can play an active role to find solutions, including new social, urban and housing policies, to preserve the social mix in neighbourhoods.(5)']"

Exercise your way to better bone health,"['Brittle bones can be a real problem as we age, especially for women after menopause. Osteoporosis is a condition that causes your bones to become weak and break more easily (1). Breaks occur most commonly in the hip, wrist, or spine (1;2). Aging alone increases your risk of osteoporosis, but you may be even more at risk if you are a woman, are past-menopause, have a family history of the disease, or have a small body frame. Lifestyle factors like smoking, alcohol, diet, and exercise can also play a role (1). Falling and breaking a bone happens frequently among older adults (3) and can significantly decrease quality of life (4). Worldwide, an estimated 9 million fractures (aka breaks) occur every year due to osteoporosis (5). In Canada, osteoporosis accounts for 80% of all fractures after 50 years of age. This means that of the 30,000 Canadians that experience a broken hip each year, 24,000 are due to osteoporosis (4). Is bone loss an inevitable part of aging? Yes – to a certain extent – but there are things you can do to slow it down. A recentsystematic reviewfound that combined exercise programs can improve and preserve bone density in postmenopausal women above and beyond the benefits offered by usual levels of daily physical activity. These benefits to bone density can prevent bone loss and potentially reduce the risk of fractures (2). Combined exercise programs may include activities such as resistance training (e.g. upper and lower body training – leg press, squats, weights) (2;6), impact exercises (e.g. jumping, skipping), and aerobic exercises (e.g. walking, jogging, dancing). Programs evaluated in the review were delivered either at a center, or in both one’s home and a center; were fully or partially supervised; occurred 2-6 days/week; and lasted between 8-30 months (2). For those who are worried that exercise may increase their risk of falling – no exercise-related injuries were reported in the review (2). We all know that exercise is good for building muscle, but combined exercise may be good for your bones too!']"

These are spaces dedicated to older men that aim to break their social isolation, provide them with a place to work and talk, and put them in contact with professionals who could diagnose physical or mental health problems.By attending these clubs, older men can stay active, develop new skills, help their community, engage in recreational activities, make new friends and even discuss health issues with healthcare and social-care professionals.The men's shed is an Australian concept dating back more than 20 years. This concept has taken root in Canada, with 17 men’s sheds in five Canadian provinces.(1-3) Created in response to the alarming rate of suicide among older men in Australia, these clubs are now focused on improving the overall health and well-being of older men around the world. Without wanting to perpetuate clichés of men always playing with their tools in their shed, and having difficulty establishing social relations, it remains that many older men thrive in this kind of environment, surrounded by men who share common interests. A systematic review of 14 studies, including 11 from Australia, two from the United Kingdom and one from Canada, examined the effects of men's sheds and other social activities for older men on their health and well-being.(4) Men often have habits that pose certain health risks (alcohol and tobacco use, for example), have more difficulty in developing friendships as they get older, tend to be more socially isolated, and are less likely to join social or community groups, unlike their female counterparts. Developing social activities for older men, especially those who are lonely or socially isolated, and encouraging their participation, is therefore often complex.Measuring the concrete effects of activities dedicated to men (whether in the context of men's sheds or other clubs) is challenging. However, the systematic review reveals that allowing older men to share their health concerns and experiences in a supportive environment that is not perceived as part of the formal health and social-services system seems to increase their overall well-being.The 14 studies identified in the systematic review provided answers to various questions to measure the effects of men's sheds on the overall health of older men. 1) What are the effects on the physical health of older men? Studies identified in the systematic review indicate that while participants themselves reported improvements in their physical health status, the researchers did not find robust evidence (or objective or validated physical health measures) about the effects of men's sheds on the physical health of older men. 2) What are the effects on the mental health of older men? Compared with other types of social activities designed for men, the review found more evidence about the positive effects of men's sheds on the mental health of older men, perhaps because they contribute to a strong feeling of belonging. 3) What are the effects on the well-being of older men? Men's sheds also appear to be beneficial to the social well-being of older men, as they give them a sense of personal and social accomplishment by enabling them to learn and share skills. This contributes to their self-esteem, but also to allowing them to play a meaningful and useful role in their community, which gives meaning to their lives. In addition, developing friendships with men of their generation helps to counter social isolation, and they benefit from a better support network. 4) What factors contribute to the success of men's sheds? It is important that men’s sheds be well located geographically, and that they offer a wide range of activities and extended hours of operation. Researchers also found that a qualified coordinator can support the operations of the men’s sheds and help to promote participation of older men.Men who frequent the sheds appreciate when activities are voluntary and not too structured. Studies have reported that men tend to see themselves as volunteers or members (rather than clients or patients). These men come together to enjoy hands-on activities and to give back to their community, rather than being the beneficiaries of a complex social intervention to improve their health and well-being. Finally, the sense of belonging to a social group, the friendships and the support that is built over time are key pillars of the men's sheds. Men's sheds specifically address the social needs of older men who are isolated by focusing on the social determinants of health. To reduce health disparities, healthcare and social-care professionals (including community workers) can take advantage of men’s sheds to offer conferences, prevention workshops, and screening activities dedicated to older men.Are you interested in creating or supporting a men's shed in your community? The Canadian Men's Sheds Association offers a comprehensive user toolkit and guide to create men’s sheds, and also to overcome the resistance among older men who are socially isolated:http://menssheds.ca/the-toolkitandhttp://menssheds.ca/build-your-own-utility-shed""]"

A new class of medications might help you breathe a little easier,"['If your life is particularly exciting, it may leave you breathless. Unfortunately, many who experience breathlessness on a regular basis suffer from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD. COPD – a lung disease that blocks air flow to the lungs – affects at least 4% of Canadians, and is a leading cause of illness and death nation-wide (1). In most cases, the symptoms of COPD start to appear after the age of 55, and the severity of the disease increases with age (2). Symptoms of COPD can include shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, and the production of mucus. Many people living with COPD find that these symptoms can interfere with basic daily activities; 45% percent of Canadians with COPD feel that they are in poor health, and 33% report that their health has declined within the last year (3). Cigarette smokers or ex-smokers are most at risk for COPD, but not everyone who gets COPD has smoked cigarettes. Other risk factors include oversensitive airways, genetics, second-hand smoke, and workplace exposure to dust, organic materials, or air pollution (4). COPD is a serious condition that unfortunately has no cure (4). However, there is a new treatment on the horizon – phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors – that may help people with COPD catch their breath (5). PDE4 inhibitors are a class of medications that open the airways and reduce lung inflammation. Two drugs, which come in tablet form and are taken orally, are currently available:roflumilastandcilomilast. A recentsystematic reviewfound that people with COPD who took PDE4 inhibitors experienced improved lung function. These findings were based on tests that measured the maximum amount of air a person can forcefully exhale in one second. However, it is not clear whether these improvements in lung function translate into detectable benefits for COPD patients. Additionally, research has shown that PDE4 inhibitors produce a small improvement in quality of life. People who took PDE4 inhibitors also experienced fewer episodes of severe breathing difficulty, but did not report improved exercise tolerance. PDE4 inhibitors were not without side effects. Common side effects included diarrhea, nausea, headache, vomiting, indigestion, and abdominal pain. In fact, over 10% of people taking PDE4 inhibitors experienced these troublesome side effects. People takingroflumilastwere particularly prone to weight loss, while high doseroflumilastwas associated with an increased risk of negative psychiatric effects. Although the results are promising, additional research needs to be done to determine the long-term positive and negative effects of PDE4 inhibitors, and whether these new medications can slow the progression of COPD (5). If you have COPD, talk to your doctor about whether PDE4 inhibitors are a good option for you.']"
204,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/06/20/breaking-down-the-walls-of-solitude,20 June 2018,Breaking down the walls of solitude,"['Many of us have heard a lonely older adult saying that he or she was waiting for death.This feeling of sadness and loneliness is experienced by many older adults. Mother Teresa said that ""the most\xa0terrible\xa0poverty is\xa0loneliness\xa0and the feeling of being\xa0unloved."" This feeling of loneliness can be transient, in relation to life events, but it can also persist when declining physical and cognitive capacities prevent seniors from seizing opportunities to socialize.Different risk factors can contribute to the feeling of solitude experienced by many older adults.(1) The death of a spouse may lead to symptoms of depression and withdrawal from social life. The negative consequences of widowhood seem particularly important among men. Older adults who live alone, and have few friends or family members experience greater loneliness. Women report more loneliness than men, especially because they live longer. Culture, personality traits and life experiences may also explain why some older adults experience a greater sense of loneliness than others.Although we have a better understanding of the risk factors and impacts of loneliness, it is important to better understand the phenomenon of loneliness from the perspective of seniors. A systematic review of 11 qualitative studies examined the perspective of older adults experiencing loneliness and its negative effects on their well-being, satisfaction of their needs, and quality of life.(1) In this review, loneliness was defined as suffering caused by the lack of social interaction, both in quantity and quality. The title of the systematic review is particularly evocative: Trapped in an empty waiting room.Four main themes emerged from the review: negative emotions, loss of meaningful interpersonal relationships, self-perception and coping strategies. Loneliness is seen by many older adults as a wall that separates them from their environment, leaving them helpless and imprisoned in a meaningless life.Older adults experiencing loneliness reported being overwhelmed by negative emotions such as sadness and pain, as well as anger or disappointment when they felt neglected, rejected or misunderstood by their loved ones. Fear and anxiety were experienced by many of these older adults because they were afraid of being a burden to others, did not want to be forced to move, and felt vulnerable because of illness and diminished capacities.Also, when the older adult is one of the last living representatives of his or her generation, the feeling of abandonment and the desire to die were often exacerbated. The death of a loved one contributes greatly to the feeling of loneliness. The quality of social relations is more important than quantity: older adults value authentic relationships with friends or neighbors rather than with family members who feel compelled to visit them.Many older adults find it difficult to be neglected by family or friends who are busy living their own lives.Loneliness is also more marked during significant moments of the day or the year: during meals, festivities, holidays, evenings and nights. Older adults who say they are lonely often feel useless in their community, which affects their self-esteem. Having meaningful social roles, and knowing that they mean something to their loved ones, can greatly improve their self-esteem.Retirement, loss of a driver\'s licence and the lack of public transportation to meet their travel needs, poor financial means, cognitive and physical decline, and the lack of appropriate services contribute to the social isolation of many older adults and their feeling of being worthless. Some older adults are ashamed to feel lonely and believe that they are responsible for this condition, which contributes to their withdrawal. Speaking of it remains difficult, because it is seen as an admission of weakness, a burden that they do not want to put on their family.Depending on their health status and capacities, some older adults are trying to be more active, through gardening, volunteering, phoning friends or relatives, listening to television, caring for an animal, looking for comfort in religion, and other coping strategies to deal with solitude. The decline in their health and a lack of energy, however, prevent many of them from performing \xa0activities that would make them feel better.']"

Yoga has been practiced for thousands of years, and many tout its ability to strengthen the body, mind and spirit. Mounting evidence suggests that yoga may also help us cope with various health conditions that affect us as we age, including cancer (1) and asthma (2).In fact, yoga has gained tremendous popularity in recent years (3), but what is it exactly?Yoga is a sequence of strengthening and stretching poses linked with deep breathing, meditation, or relaxation (4). Although there are many different types of yoga to choose from (4), all revolve around the core principles of balancing and improving a person’s physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual well-being. Closely linked to meditation, yoga is known for being a stress-reduction technique (5).Diabetes is a growing epidemic that affects millions of Canadians (6) and yields serious side effects, such as blindness, nerve damage, and stroke (7). Can embracing your inner yogi help you manage your diabetes? A recentsystematic reviewfound that people with type 2 diabetes who practiced yoga – for an average of 50 sessions, lasting one hour, over 12 weeks – experienced better control of their blood sugar, compared to people with type 2 diabetes who did not practice yoga. Small to medium improvements were also seen in cholesterol, blood pressure, and body mass index, but no effect on weight loss was observed (8).Similarly, another review found that yoga may be beneficial when used as a complementary therapy. That means when yoga was combined with other diabetes management techniques (e.g., standard diabetes care, education, lifestyle modification, diet control, or medication), people with type 2 diabetes were better able to control their blood sugar levels (9).When looking at yoga as a leisure-time activity, best results may be achieved when people engage in it more than 3 times per week, for eight or more weeks, according to the findings of a third review (10). More research is needed to determine the long-term effects of yoga on diabetes management (8;9).If you have type 2 diabetes, consider embracing your inner yogi. This doesn’t mean that you have to bend yourself into a pretzel, but making yoga part of your life may help you manage the disease.']"

Living in a familiar environment allows them to maintain some autonomy, which promotes a higher quality of life and better health, despite the negative effects of the disease. But providing home care to a loved one with dementia is not easy. Caregivers must learn to manage the difficult behaviours of people with dementia. They often experience physical health problems, psychological distress and social isolation.Over the last 20 years, alternative approaches such as art therapy and music therapy have been offered to older adults with dementia and their caregivers. These approaches focus on the importance of music. Music creates emotions and causes physical effects in people: happy or quiet music lowers the heart rate and reduces stress, for example. Did you know that choir-singing boosts the immune system's hormones while helping to strengthen social ties?Musical activities are often offered in residential and long-term care centres for seniors with dementia, and their positive impact is well documented. Can older adults with dementia living in their homes also benefit from the positive effects of music? Researchers have identified 17 studies that demonstrate that music positively influences people's lives by reducing agitation and improving their cognitive abilities and well-being.(2) Music reduces complaints, pain, verbal and physical abuse, and the confusion of agitated older adults with dementia. Studies have also found that music has a positive effect on the memory of older adults with dementia, allowing them to recognize familiar tunes, remember old souvenirs, and can help them play an instrument or perform musical activities.The impact of music on the social well-being of older adults and their caregivers is not insignificant. Music promotes engagement, support and communication between people. It can relieve some of the burden on caregivers providing care to older adults with dementia. For example, researchers examined whether listening to music, coupled with physical activity or discussion, helped improve caregivers’ moods and reduce caregivers’ distress. The results are clear: although the effects were positive among older adults with dementia, the caregivers’ response was the most positive in terms of relaxation, comfort and happiness.Studies have shown that listening to music allows older adults with dementia to be calmer, which indirectly helps to reduce caregivers’ levels of stress. Also, group music therapy sessions led by a trained music therapists helped reduce caregivers’ anxiety by allowing them to express and share their feelings.In the various studies, it has been observed that music has improved the relationship between the caregiver (who is often the spouse) and an older adult with dementia, allowing them to enjoy a common activity that is pleasant, and that they had experienced earlier in their life. It has also improved verbal and non-verbal communication between caregivers and older adults, by promoting reminiscing about shared memories, whether by playing music or singing together to express emotions. Also, music increases self-esteem and decreases caregivers’ anxiety and loneliness. Music is a catalyst for human relationships, enabling the creation of strong emotional bonds between people.Music is a simple and inexpensive strategy whose benefits are very real. To help older adults with dementia, why not allow them to listen to their favourite music, play an instrument, or even form a choir?(3) This is equally beneficial for caregivers. It would be wise, however, not to leave them the task of organizing and directing these musical activities to the caregivers alone, as the perceived benefits may diminish because of the stress and mental burden involved. Professionally-led musical activities are offered in nursing homes and by recreational services of several municipalities. So, let the sound of music brighten up our homes and communities for the well-being of our elders and their caregivers.""]"

Try these 3 self-care strategies,"['Coping with depression can be an uphill battle. You may feel like you have a boulder in tow as you move through your day, and this weight can leave you feeling sad, upset, angry, anxious, worthless, or guilty. Depression can rob you of your will to carry out daily activities – even those that you once enjoyed. You may also have trouble thinking, sleeping, and eating. You may even think about suicide (1;2).Some people are more at risk than others. For example, you are at a higher risk of depression if a close family member has had a mental illness, if you have a chronic illness, or if you have had depression before (2). As of 2012, about 2% of Canadians aged 65 or older were identified as having depression in the past 12 months (3). Although it is common, it is important to remember that depression is not a normal part of growing older (1).Depression can be diagnosed by your doctor and treated with medication, psychotherapy and alternative approaches. These treatments may be prescribed alone or in combination (1). In addition to the treatment recommended by your doctor, the following self-care strategies may help. 1.  Keep active When you are depressed, motivating yourself toexercisecan be a challenge. But research shows that exercise is a great antidepressant – without the negative side effects. In fact, physical activity such as aerobics, strength training, Tai Chi, or dancing can provide a big boost to your mood and sense of well-being (4). Older adults who practicedTai Chion a regular basis had significantly fewer symptoms of depression than people not practicing Tai Chi (5).Walking in groupswere also found to keep depression at bay in older adults (6). 2.  Practice mindfulness There has been increased interest in mindfulness in recent years, and for good reason. If you have experienced recurrent depression,mindfulness-based cognitive therapy(MBCT) could help prevent it from happening again. MBCT uses meditative practices that focus on being in the present moment. Research shows that people who try this type of therapy are less likely to relapse than people taking antidepressants or using other types of therapy (7). MBCT is also available over theinternet, making it relatively easy to access (8). 3.  Share memories Have you ever noticed that a particular sight, sound, smell, or taste can bring forth a rush of vivid memories? Reminiscence therapy, which involvessharing personal stories and memoriesin groups led by a trained facilitator, can be a powerful way to remember happier times (9). Talking about accomplishments, happy memories, or sharing experiences can promote comfort and help people connect the past to the present (10). For people living in long-term care homes, this approach has been shown to reduce feelings of loneliness and depression (9).']"

These can support home renovations, and can improve access to various assistive technologies to ensure a safer home environment, such as a panic button, an adapted bathtub, grab bars, or a chair on a rail to go up and down stairs.(2)Older adults who have cognitive and functional limitations and whose homes are not adapted to their needs sometimes consider moving to an assisted-living facility or nursing home. This can add to the financial burden for older adults, their families and the healthcare and social-care systems (not to mention the social and emotional impacts of such a change). However, home modifications may be a promising strategy to help older adults stay in the comfort of their homes, while improving their ability to carry out their daily activities and ensuring their safety and well-being. But what do we know about the effectiveness of such home modifications? A systematic review of 36 studies was conducted to examine the effectiveness of home modifications to support home care and community involvement of older adults.(2) The results indicate that home modifications can be beneficial in several ways. Improving cognitive and functional capacities of older adults Older adults whose homes have been adapted and who have also received services from professionals (such as occupational therapists, physiotherapists, or nurses) have seen an improvement in their cognitive and functional capacities. For example, frail older adults who had home modifications had less difficulty performing their daily activities, were less afraid of falling, were more independent, and lived in a home generally perceived as safer. These home modifications were done in addition to other interventions designed to provide them with education, and with training offered by occupational therapists and physiotherapists to improve their strength and balance. Supporting caregivers The positive effects of home modification interventions on caregivers of older adults with dementia have also been demonstrated. Being able to rely on effective assistive technologies in the home can facilitate care routines. By creating a safer home environment, these interventions also help caregivers feel less stressed and more competent, and they can better manage the difficult behaviours and memory loss of older adults with dementia. Reducing the risk of falls Home modifications are often coupled with at least one other fall-prevention intervention, such as those conducted by occupational and physical therapists (for example, conducting a residential risk assessment and developing a plan to eliminate identified risk). Such comprehensive interventions have been shown to reduce the risk of falls.Of note is that none of the studies identified by this systematic review examined the effect of home modifications on community participation by older adults,The findings from this systematic review can be used as a guide to which home modifications can improve the functional capacities of older adults, reduce the risk of falls, and help caregivers delivering care to older adults who wish to age in place. Home modifications coupled with other interventions have been shown to be more effective. It is likely that the rigorous assessment of risk factors in the home environment, the implementation of a plan to remedy the situation, and the education of caregivers and older adults in the safe use of assistive technologies, will allow older adults to age in their homes for as long as possible, safely and with dignity.Occupational therapists, whose role is to plan and supervise programs of activities for people with physical, psychological or mental disabilities, seem particularly well suited to support the implementation of these interventions. Also, do not hesitate to rely on other workers with the required expertise: construction professionals are increasingly familiar with the safety standards and home adaptations required for seniors with a variety of health problems.(1; 4)']"

In fact, you are probably reading this blog right now on your phone, tablet or computer. Unfortunately for some, chronic illness is also an everyday reality that comes with many new prescriptions and confusing rules to keep symptoms at bay.A chronic condition is one that doesn’t go away with time, usually lasting longer than three months. Conditions such as heart disease, type 2 diabetes, respiratory disease, and arthritis fall into this category (1). Many people who have a chronic condition, have more than one, making them more challenging to manage (2;3). Older adults are at an increased risk for chronic conditions (3).Chronic conditions are often “self-managed”. Self-management skills are daily activities that can help you take control of or lower the impact that a chronic condition has on your life (4). Some examples include taking your medications as instructed, improving your diet, or getting more exercise (5).But for some, self-management is an overwhelming task. This is where technology may help (3;6;7;8;9).“Telehealth” is emerging as a good way to improve a patient’s self-management skills. It uses communications technology – including audio, video and websites – to deliver healthcare services and health information to people near and far (10).A chronic health condition can be a heavy burden, especially when it comes to managing your own care. Can telehealth lighten your load? Research shows that telehealth can support self-management among older adults with chronic conditions, in part by building capacity for improving self-care skills and self-monitoring behaviors (3;6;7;8;9).For example, technology that improves long-distance communication between older adults and their health care providers helped patients with chronic conditions take their medications as directed and improve self-care. Patients were more knowledgeable about their health, and experienced a better overall quality of life (3). Additionally, when looking at respiratory disease, type 2 diabetes, and heart disease, telehealth led to a reduction in hospitalization rates (6), and improved blood sugar control (7;8) and weight and BMI (9), respectively.  For conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and an over-active bladder, web-based communication strategies (such as discussion boards and online surveys) were also effective at empowering patients to take better care of themselves (3).Future research should evaluate the long-term effectiveness of telehealth, because some studies have shown that the benefits decrease over time. The impact of additional factors such as ethnicity and culture also warrants attention (3).If you suffer from a chronic condition, cast your morbid thoughts aside – there are things you can do to self-manage it and improve your health. Embracing technology is one of them.']"

Factors influencing older adultsâ decisions about housing,"['Your parents or grandparents are getting older. They need daily care. You fear that they will fall and hurt themselves…You may think that the best solution for them would be to leave their home and move to a small apartment, an assisted-living facility or a nursing home. The decision seems logical and straightforward, but have you considered the social and psychological impact that such a change has on older adults? The decision to leave their home is sometimes painful. They must leave an environment to which they are attached and where they feel good. They must leave their neighbourhood and their friends. They may be afraid of sacrificing their autonomy and privacy.In Canada, about 90% of people aged 65 and over still live in their homes.(1) It is estimated that 30% of people aged 75 and over and 50% of those aged 85 and over receive care at home.(2) When help becomes insufficient and their autonomy and capacities diminish (both physical and cognitive), older adults and their loved ones must evaluate their options. These may be to stay in their home and adapt it, or to move to more suitable housing with or without additional care delivered. Such reflections are complex. It is therefore important to understand what the home represents for an older adult, as well as the range of factors that can influence their decisions. A systematic review examined the factors influencing housing decisions of frail older adults over the age of 65 (without cognitive impairment).(3) The studies included in this systematic review identified 88 factors grouped in six dimensions:1) the psychological and psychosocial dimension (for example, level of control, perceived safety, and physical and psychological comfort);2) the socio-economic and health dimension (for example, factors related to age and health status, income, and level of education);3) the economic dimension (for example, factors related to property, financial investment, savings and affordable housing);4) the social dimension (for example, places of socialization, concepts of intimacy and refuge);5) the time and space-time dimension (for example, living in an environment we know, to which we are attached, and which offer us memories); and6) the built or natural environment dimension (for example, factors related to urban or natural environments, access to commercial services and facilities, safety of the living environment, and accessibility of housing). The results reveal that the factors that had the greatest effect in housing decisions are often those related to social, psychological and psychosocial dimensions. Among the most important factors are the sense of control over the decision and the environment, relationships with the neighbourhood, routines and lifestyle, access to amenities, access to health professionals, feelings of comfort and independence, social activities and networks, proximity to services and siblings, the ability to adapt homes, familiarity with the environment, as well as triggering events (including events\xa0that can precipitate a decline in physical, cognitive, or mental health). Conversely, the socio-economic dimension appeared to have less weight in housing decisions.Deciding to stay or leave is a very delicate and complex decision. That said, having a better understanding of the range of factors influencing older adults’ housing decisions will help loved ones and professionals better support their decision-making process. Ultimately, it will help older adults make the best possible decision about housing based on their own circumstances and values.Research shows that we cannot focus housing decisions on care needs only, because the social, psychological and psychosocial factors are so important to older adults. We have everything to gain by adopting a holistic approach considering the full range of needs, values and preferences of older adults. The research also suggests the need to explore housing options that meet the social, comfort and independence needs of older adults. This could take the form of home modifications to avoid uprooting older adults who wish to stay in their house and community for as long as possible, or to design alternative housing in which older adults truly feel at home.']"
211,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/04/30/nsaids-a-hidden-heart-risk-in-your-medicine-cabinet,30 April 2018,Do you have a hidden heart risk in your medicine cabinet?,"['Millions of people have nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as Advil, Aleve, Anaprox, Celebrex, Motrin and Voltaren (1;2), sitting in their bathroom cabinet, and many people will pop one or two casually at the slightest pain. NSAIDs, are available as pills, creams or gels, and many can be purchased over-the-counter (1). So, they are safe, right? NSAIDs can be used to tackle inflammation and all sorts of aches and pains – headaches, sore muscles, achy joints, cramps and toothaches – to name a few (1). Possible side effects from NSAIDs include stomach pain, constipation, vomiting, diarrhea and dizziness. NSAIDs can also have more serious effects on the heart. Your risk for these side effects is higher if you are taking other medications, have certain health conditions, or have been taking NSAIDs for a long time (2). Studies have also linked NSAIDs to an increased risk of heart attack (3;4), with the level of risk tied to the type of NSAID, how much is taken, and for how long (3;4). Aspirin is also an NSAID (1), and can produce side effects such as stomach and intestinal ulcers, and internal bleeding (2). In addition to being used to treat pain, fever, and inflammation, it is also used in low doses to treat or prevent heart attacks and stroke (1). Unlike other NSAIDs, evidence shows that taking aspirin in low doses can reduce non-fatal heart attacks (5). But what about those other NSAIDs? Should you avoid taking them for aches and pains? A recently published review assessed the risk of heart attack with the use of the following NSAIDs:celecoxib,diclofenac,ibuprofen,naproxen, androfecoxib(which is no longer available). There is now convincing evidence that these oral NSAIDs (the pill form) – can increase your risk of heart attack, includingnaproxen(4), which was previously thought to be a safer option (3). Given its protective effect on preventing heart attacks, aspirin was not included in the review. The evidence also shows that you can be at increased risk of heart attack as soon as you begin taking an NSAID, and that the higher the dose, the higher your risk. In most cases, longer NSAID use (for more than 30 days) does not appear to increase your risk of heart attack beyond the risk seen with short term usage. Once you stop taking NSAIDS, your risk of heart attack returns to normal over time (4). Should you chuck the NSAIDs sitting in your bathroom cabinet over these findings? Not necessarily. NSAIDs are still a valuable tool for millions of people. But don’t take their safety for granted either. If you do need an NSAID for pain, make sure that you are aware of its risks. Also, work closely with your doctor to find the safest possible medication, dose, and duration to get the job done. If you are taking aspirin to prevent a heart attack, make sure you discuss with your doctor what to take for aches and pains before reaching for another NSAID.']"

Those with an employer-sponsored pension plan know that money will continue to flow regardless of how long they live, but not everyone has this benefit. They must therefore create their own retirement savings and manage their finances carefully to maintain their standard of living in retirement. Many people say they are ‘ready,’ but they often underestimate the costs of unexpected life events, such as taking care of a loved one, dealing with illness and disability, or covering the costs associated with new needs for health and social care services. Many are even in debt when they start their retirement. In 2012, it was estimated that 42.5% of people aged 65 and over had debts (an increase of 55% over 1999 according to Statistics Canada data)(1; 2).Once retired, older adults (and their caregivers) face the challenge of making a realistic budget based on fixed and limited incomes, while juggling many priority expenses. Consider also the difficulty of navigating the various programs and services that are partially (or not) covered by their insurance and governments, or the often opaque and complex fiscal systems at different levels of government.We often hear about the importance of improving the level of “financial literacy.” Financial literacy refers to the knowledge, skills and confidence to make responsible financial decisions.(3) In 2014, the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada\xa0 launched a National Strategy for Financial Literacy to help Canadians manage their finances.(3) A strategy specifically for older adults was also in development, with four main objectives: But what do we know about the effectiveness of interventions to improve financial literacy? A systematic review examined the effectiveness of interventions aimed at increasing consumers' knowledge, skills, attitudes and behaviours in terms of finances.(5) The 188 studies covered by this systematic review identified various interventions such as financial education sessions, outreach activities and even financial messages broadcasted during popular soap operas on television. The analysis of these studies does not allow definitive conclusions to be drawn about the effectiveness of the different types of financial education interventions. More than 140 studies indicate that these interventions appear to have a positive impact in some areas that are considered fundamental to good personal financial management, including increased savings and financial skills such as record keeping. That being said, these interventions do not necessarily seem to prevent certain problems, including defaulting on payments. Approximately 40 other studies, however, reveal that these interventions had no or little impact on financial knowledge and skills. Several studies also reveal that interventions have different effects depending on the target populations. These results highlight the importance of more robust studies to identify the most effective financial education interventions, as well as studies that focus more specifically on older adults and their caregivers.

Exercise can help prevent falls in long-term care,"['When you were young it was simple: if you fell, you got back up. But as you age, falls become more likely, and more dangerous.It’s not the fall that’s the problem – it’s the landing that hurts. In Canada, falls are the most common reason for hospitalization in older adults (1). Between 2017–2018, falls led to a staggering 112,008\xa0hospitalizations (1) and this number is on the rise (2).Falling can be a life-changing event, especially for older adults. One in five falls results in either a broken bone or a head injury (3). The wrist, arm, ankle or hip are the most likely places for a break to occur (3) and falls can even lead to death (2). The recovery from a fall can also be lengthy. Older adults spend an average of 6 to 9 days longer in the hospital for a fall than for all other reasons. Falling can also lead to a shattered sense of self-confidence linked to a fear of falling again (2).Older adults in long-term care are in a unique situation – although their risk of falling is lower than those living at home (1), they are at higher risk of breaking a hip if they do find themselves on the floor (2).The good news is that falls are not inevitable. One way for residents in long-term care to stand up to falls is exercise (4;5).So, how can residents living in long-term care prevent a fall? Exercise programs that focus on balance appear to be helpful in preventing falls, especially when they are combined with exercises designed to improve strength, mobility, endurance, and gait (how you walk) (4;5). The most benefit is achieved when fall prevention strategies are customized to an individual’s needs, and exercise is combined with other strategies such asadjusting medications, removing tripping hazards, education about fall prevention, and using mobility aids like walkers or canes (4).Research also shows that more frequent exercise is better. Programs that combine different types of exercise are most beneficial when they are offered 2-3 times a week. Both short and long-term programs have demonstrated beneficial effects. Although these programs have been shown to prevent falls, they do not help to prevent broken bones when a fall occurs (5).Life is a continual balancing act. If you are an older adult living in long-term care and worry about falling, exercise combined with other fall prevention strategies can help keep you steady on your feet.']"

Challenges faced by LGBTQ2 older adults,"['In November 2017, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau publicly apologized to LGBTQ2 members (lesbians, gays, bisexuals, trans, queers and two-spirited) about the systematic oppression and rejection the state has shown towards them. He pointed out that members of the LGBTQ2 community are, still today, the victims of violence and discrimination, as well as facing mental health problems and homelessness.(1)Nationally available statistics on LGBTQ2 persons in Canada remain limited – previous census not including comprehensive questions on gender identity and sexual orientation. Current statistics allow us to estimate that LGBT people make up about 13% of the Canadian population (no such data being available to estimate the proportion of persons identifying as queer or two-spirited).(2) However, LGBTQ2 people seem invisible among older adults, many still being afraid to disclose their sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, many fear moving to nursing homes where they may face discrimination, exclusion and prejudice.(3; 4)To better support LGBTQ2 older adults, it is essential to better understand the challenges they face. Two systematic reviews, which included 34 and 41 studies respectively, provide some insights on the subject.(5; 6) These systematic reviews were conducted to better understand the psychosocial influences, needs, and experiences of aging experienced by non-heterosexual and transgender individuals. The first systematic review revealed that transgender and non-heterosexual people often experience more physical and sexual violence, as well as family and social isolation, discrimination, economic inequality and mental health issues.(5) Throughout their lives, these people also face barriers to accessing education, employment and housing, while having difficulty accessing adequate social support networks. In addition, some members of the transgender community appear to be confronted with discriminatory policies and practices in health and social services, and also with a lack of professional knowledge about their physiology or the long-term effects of treatments and hormones.The second systematic review focuses on older adults from the lesbian, gay and bisexual communities.(6) The studies included in this review examine the psychosocial influences on aging among non-heterosexual individuals with respect to their identity (for example, their mental health and body image) and social factors (for example, intimate relationships, social support, discrimination, care received and delivered, access to healthcare services and housing). The findings suggest that lesbian, gay and bisexual older adults are doing well in managing their identity, as well as their mental and social health. That said, they still face different forms of discrimination in accessing health services, ranging from ageism to so-called ""hetero-normative"" discrimination (they may be confronted by norms and beliefs that impose heterosexuality as the only sexuality or legitimate way of life). A positive attitude towards oneself and one\'s sexuality seems to be the key to better mental health for lesbian, gay and bisexual older adults\xa0 - just like being in a positive emotional or sexual relationship. A decrease in age-related cognitive skills (for example, decreased verbal skills, non-verbal reasoning, or memory) appears to exacerbate stigma and social isolation among lesbian, gay and bisexual older adults. Although attitudes are changing and there is a growing recognition of the need to adapt the care provided to them, LGBTQ2 older adults still face negative experiences, including problems related to access to health and social services. Whether it is the prejudices or ignorance of a professional, or the impossibility of freely discussing their sexuality and their experiences, these and other factors tend to isolate them and prevent them from seeking care for fear of being treated differently or being ignored. Discrimination, exclusion and prejudice thus affect their mental and physical health, and lead to symptoms of anxiety or post-traumatic stress that may require specialized psychological interventions.Health and social-service professionals can help LGBTQ2 older adults build on their resiliency in times of emotional turmoil, and to overcome the physical and cognitive challenges of aging. In addition, these professionals could become more sensitive to the fact that LGBTQ2 older adults have negative experiences related to access to services, and try to better engage their ""chosen families"" in care planning. Indeed, LGBTQ2 community members disproportionately experience rejection from their biological or adoptive families. As a result, many are building deep and lasting bonds with other members of their communities who will form their new and “chosen” families. Lastly, better training for professionals and implementing programs specifically designed for LGBTQ2 older adults may help them to remain healthy, active and engaged as long as possible.']"
215,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/04/02/living-with-diabetes-your-peers-can-help,2 April 2018,Living with diabetes? Your peers can help!,"['You may be familiar with the old saying “You can’t understand someone until you’ve walked a mile in their shoes”. Diabetes can be a challenging disease. No one knows better about a diabetic’s experience than another diabetic.The number of people with diabetes is on the rise in Canada. It is estimated that 4.9 million Canadians will be living with diabetes by 2026 (1). Diabetes becomes more prevalent with advancing age – in Canada, 1 in 6 older adults report having the disease (2). Type 2 diabetes is the most common, accounting for 90-95% of all cases (3).Type 2 diabetes is not just about monitoring blood sugar – although this is an important aspect of diabetes care. Diabetes management also requires lifestyle modifications like diet, exercise and taking medications (4). If it is not managed properly, diabetes increases the risk of health complications like heart disease and nerve, kidney, eye and foot damage (5).Chronic diseases like diabetes are often “self-managed” – a model of care that empowers patients to be in control of their own treatments (6). But managing diabetes involves a lot of responsibility and work. This can leave some patients feeling overwhelmed and alone.This is where peer support may help. Peer support is based on the idea that people with diabetes understand what it is like to live with the disease day-to-day. Therefore, they are in a good position to provide support, encouragement and advice based on their own experiences. Peer support can complement other health care services by creating the emotional, social and practical help necessary for managing the disease (7).But can peer support really help people with diabetes stay healthy?Researchsought to answer this question. In most of the studies in this research, diabetes education sessions were provided by a trained peer supporter or community health worker in a group setting. Peer support participants met weekly or every other week for a total of 6-8 sessions of 2-2.5 hours each. Other studies explored peer support given to individuals rather than groups. Numerous topics were discussed, including the basics of diabetes, blood sugar monitoring, medication adherence, self-management skills, diabetes complications, and lifestyle changes. Peer support sessions also provided a place for social and emotional support (8). Research shows that peer support may help lower blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes, compared with people who receive standard diabetes care (8;9). More frequent peer support sessions (at least 1-2 times per month) and the inclusion of one-on-one support (vs. group support or a combination of the two) are the most effective in lowering blood sugar (8). People who have higher blood sugar levels or poor blood sugar control to begin with may benefit the most (8;9). More research is needed to determine if peer support is effective in low-income populations (8).If you struggle with managing your diabetes, peer support can improve your ability to self-manage your disease, leading to better health.']"

Thanks to robotics, we have now created prosthetic robot-arms, robotic surgical assistants, robotic aids to clean the house while we’re gone, as well as robotic dogs. The logical next step, in a context of aging populations, was to develop robots that can deliver care to older adults or could assist caregivers and health professionals. In recent years, socially assistive robots have been tested.In 2016, IBM created the Multi-Purpose Eldercare Robot Assistant (MERA) prototype based on the Pepper robot developed by SoftBank Robotics in Japan in 2014. MERA can analyze videos of a person\'s face and measure vital signs like heart and respiratory rates. The robot can also answer basic questions about health, as well as identify when an individual is falling (1; 2).In recent years, research has focused on the perceptions and experiences of people aged 50 to 95 related to socially assistive robots. A recent systematic review identified 23 studies on the subject. Four major themes emerged from these studies: 1) the roles of socially assistive robots; 2) their interactions with older adults; 3) their appearance; and 4) the ethical dilemmas that they raise.(3) The systematic review reveals that older adults envision socially assistive robots playing certain roles such as performing physically difficult tasks, reminding them to take their medications or go to an appointment, entertaining them and keeping them company. Such robots are also seen as a safety device that can warn relatives or health professionals in the event of a fall or deterioration of health.The means of communicating with socially assistive robots are greatly influencing the perceptions of older adults. If the robots recognize human voices or allow interacting through touch screens, older adults seem to perceive them more positively. It\'s even better if the robots can respond spontaneously with a ""human"" voice. The review also revealed that older adults generally expect the robots to perform perfectly at all times; otherwise they will become doubtful of the robots’ reliability.Older adults expressed divergent views about the appearance of socially assistive robots. Many liked humanoid-style robots, others preferred if they look like machines, while some favoured a hybrid look. Many older adults perceived humanoid robots as more socially acceptable, while others are uncomfortable with ""using"" a robot that looks like a human. Among those who preferred humanoid robots, many claimed that they preferred if the robot appeared to have the same “gender”. With hybrid robots, again views were mixed. Some older adults preferred a hybrid that is neither too mechanical nor too human, while others were afraid of such hybrid appearance. Also, interactions with robots were marked by preconceived ideas, such as associating a female appearance with care and a masculine appearance with rational decision-making. Moreover, the studies mentioned the presence of an ‘anthropomorphism’ phenomenon, that is to say that older adults attributed certain human moral, physical or psychological characteristics to socially assistive robots.With regard to the ethical considerations raised by these studies, older adults expressed concerns that the use of socially assistive robots may lead to a dehumanized society and a decrease in human contact. Also, despite their preference for a robot capable of interacting as a real person, they perceived the relationship with a humanoid robot as counterfeit, a deception. Security emerged as another key consideration, since older adults perceived the surveillance function of socially assistive robots as a threat to their autonomy and privacy. Also, many older adults considered the fact of needing help and using a support robot as negative, a sign of frailty and old age. Participants also asked about the costs of buying and maintaining robots, and whether these resources should instead be invested in human personnel.Scientific and technical advances in robotics have been enormous. Socially assistive robots are becoming more and more sophisticated. They can perform various daily tasks. They have the ability to listen, talk and monitor the health status of older adults living alone, and to notify caregivers and professionals in case of an emergency. Socially assistive robots thus seem to be helpful companions. The future is here — are we ready for it?']"

A recentbusiness news reportfrom the United States noted that victims of financial fraud or abuse are losing more than $36 million annually (1).The financial exploitation of older adults has been recognized as a serious problem, associated with major consequences such as increased mental and physical health problems, more hospitalization, shortened survival, and diminished quality of life. However, knowledge about the extent of the problem is mostly limited to ‘financial abuse,’ which is perpetrated within a relationship of trust, such as family or caregivers. Little is known about elder financial fraud and scams, which are perpetrated by strangers.A recent systematic review prepared by researchers from both Canada and the United States is the first attempt to estimate the prevalence of elder financial fraud and scams in the United States (2). The review included 12  population-based studies, with a total of 41,711 individuals who lived in the community. Ten studies involved only cognitively-intact adults, and two included adults with a range of cognitive functioning.The types of scams or fraud addressed in the review included investments, products and services, employment, prize and grant money, charities and identity theft. Overall, the review concluded that one in 18 (5.4%) of cognitively-intact, community-dwelling adults are the victims of financial fraud and scams annually in the U.S. However, the studies included showed a range of prevalence depending on how they were conducted and the age range of participants.Studies that used closed-ended and descriptive questions found a higher prevalence rate (7.1%) than studies using a single self-report question approach (3.6%). Studies that were of higher quality also had a higher prevalence rate (7.5%).The review notes that the findings likely underestimate the true prevalence of the problem for various reasons: particularly vulnerable populations, such as those with cognitive impairment and living in long-term care homes, were excluded from the studies; several studies had low response rates, possibly due to previous victims being reluctant to share personal information; and victims of financial fraud and scams tend to under-report the problem.The review could not determine whether older adults experience higher rates of being victimized by fraud or scams than other age groups, but older adults have distinct age-associated characteristics that make them more vulnerable to fraud and scams.Avoiding or resisting scams and fraudulent activities requires complex, higher-order cognitive functions that are more likely to decline in older adults. Age-related changes in cognition are associated with poor decision-making and greater susceptibility to scams, and older adults are disproportionately targeted by fraud attempts with schemes designed to exploit age-associated vulnerabilities.The research also found that in addition to financial losses, victims can experience emotional and health consequences, such as depression and anxiety. A majority of victims report anger, stress, regret, betrayal, embarrassment, sadness, helplessness and shame.The authors noted that given the prevalence of the problem, it’s likely that health- and social-system professionals who work with older adults will routinely encounter victims of elder financial fraud and scams, and could be key players in addressing this issue. Instruments to help professionals screen for victims of financial fraud represents an important area for future research.']"

Can a vegetarian diet help you lose weight?,"['Losing weight and keeping it off is no easy task. Should you go low-carb, gluten-free, Mediterranean, raw, paleo? What about trying a good old vegetarian diet? Or would it be better to go vegan? When you want to shed pounds, it’s hard to know which direction to go.Globally, almost 37% of adults were considered overweight or obese in 2013; a number which has been increasing for at least four decades (1).There’s no question that maintaining a healthy weight is good for you. Being overweight or obese increases your risk of numerous health conditions, including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, sleep apnea, mental illness, and cancer (2).Vegetarianism is also on the rise. In 2015, about 3 million Canadians – or 8% of the population – were eating a vegetarian or a mostly vegetarian diet, according to a poll conducted by the Vancouver Humane Society (3). Vegetarians can be divided into two main types. Lacto-ovo vegetarians avoid meat but allow milk and eggs, while vegans eat a plant-based diet with no animal products at all (4). Research has linked vegetarian diets to a decreased risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease (5).Vegetarian diets can promote weight loss because they focus on nutrient-dense, low-calorie foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, seeds and soy. Vegan diets go even further and cut out calorie-rich foods like cheese. But being vegetarian doesn’t automatically mean consuming fewer calories. After all, many vegetarian and vegan foods pack a high-calorie punch – think soy cheese, fried foods, snack bars, and even cookies and pie (6).So, can a vegetarian diet help with weight loss? People who follow a vegetarian diet are more likely to lose weight compared to people who follow non-vegetarian nutritional plans, and vegans tend to lose more weight than lacto-ovo vegetarians. Additionally, people who follow either a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet or vegan diet and purposefully eat fewer calories experience more weight loss than individuals on these diets who do not eat less calories. The weight loss benefit of vegetarian diets has been shown to last for at least 12 months, and possibly longer, but more research is needed to determine whether these diets control weight in the long term (5).Eliminating animal-based products from your diet doesn’t guarantee that the pounds will shed themselves. But if you feel motivated and make good food choices, a lacto-ovo vegetarian or vegan diet can help you lose weight.']"
219,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/03/12/are-you-a-victim-of-abuse,12 March 2018,Are you a victim of abuse?,"['Intimidation. Negligence. Emotional blackmail and manipulation. Theft. Push and shove. Infantilization. Threat. Aggression. Abuse and neglect can take many forms.Are you an older adult? Do you feel vulnerable in certain situations? Do you think you are being abused or neglected, but are afraid of reprisals or do not know what to do? Do you have an elderly parent and worry about his or her safety? Have you witnessed acts of elder abuse?If so, you are not alone. Did you know that in Canada, it is estimated that between 4% and 10% of people over 65 live in situations of abuse and neglect (1)? According to the World Health Organization, elder abuse is: ""a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person"" (2).A systematic review of 62 studies was conducted to identify ways to prevent and combat elder abuse and neglect in Canada, particularly in healthcare settings. These studies, conducted from 2000 to 2013, focused specifically on the identification, evaluation and response to abuse cases (3). How to identify abuse and neglect Recent deterioration of health status, mental illness, alcohol or drug use, dehydration or malnutrition, poor hygiene, bruises to the face, arms or torso: these are indicators and risk factors associated with abuse and neglect cases. Talk to your health- and social-system professional about your situation at your next appointment. They can screen for, question, identify and confirm potential cases of abuse. How to prevent Several studies identified in the systematic review suggest that different stakeholders do not have a good understanding of the laws and resources to protect older adults. Implementing measures to increase knowledge about abuse could help stakeholders, for example, better identify potential cases of abuse, as well as clarify their roles and responsibilities. To prevent abuse, studies indicate that strategies to support older victims, such as support groups and organized community activities, are promising as a way to build trust with different stakeholders, promote informal exchanges, and make assistance accessible if needed. The systematic review also reveals that caregivers are often stressed and do not always know how to adequately meet the needs of the older adults they care for. Better listening to their needs, as well as offering stress management training, support for older adults and care to address specific health issues seem to mitigate psychological abusive behaviours by caregivers. Funding mass media campaigns to increase public information and awareness about elder abuse seems promising to improve the situation by breaking the silence and promoting reporting of abuse cases. Such awareness can also help to change attitudes and behaviours towards abuse. Finally, establishing clear processes to report cases of abuse within health- and social-system teams is a good practice, as well as a better interdisciplinary collaboration of different stakeholders. What organizational and systemic policies are required? To reduce the incidence of elder abuse, the systematic review highlights the importance of putting in place measures to improve the working conditions of health- and social-system professionals, monitoring abuse in institutions providing care and services to older adults, creating training and support programs, as well as developing and publicizing the resources available to older adults and caregivers.Whether you are an older adult or caregiver, resources exist to help you deal with abuse. Do not hesitate to seek help from a health professional or social worker.']"

But if you do, you’re probably not laughing – in fact, you may be doing anything to avoid exposing your toes. This is because onychomycosis, or toenail fungus, can wreak havoc on the appearance of your nails, leaving you feeling frustrated and self-conscious.Fungal toenail infections are common, affecting 2 to 14% of the general population (4;5) and one-third of people with diabetes (2). Although toenail fungus is relatively harmless, people with diabetes are at increased risk of serious complications from an infection, such as the loss of a limb (3).Clearly, nail fungus is not just a cosmetic problem. At first, toenail fungus does not cause physical symptoms, but may make an infected nail appear different from the others. As the condition worsens, however, the fungus can cause pain and discomfort; in some cases, it can even cause numbness and loss of function in the affected toe. As the physical appearance of the toenail worsens, some people also experience loss of self-esteem or opt out of social activities, and this can harm their sense of well-being (1).You may be familiar with the adage “prevention is the best medicine”. This certainly applies to toenail fungus, which is notoriously difficult to treat and rarely goes away on its own. Prevention strategies include keeping feet cool and dry, clipping nails short, and wearing footwear in public places (7).If this pesky fungus has already made an appearance, numerous antifungal agents – both topical and oral – are available to help you mount an attack. Topical treatments tend to have a lower success rates (6), so many turn to oral medications to try to cure the problem.Whether it is sandal season or not, toenail fungus sufferers everywhere want to know – which treatment option is most likely to provide a cure so that they can proudly bare their toes? Research shows a similar effect among three widely used oral antifungal medications – terbinafine, griseofulvin, and azoles, although all produce side effects. Overall, terbinafine appears to have a slightly better cure rate than either the azoles and griseofulvin, and slightly fewer side effects which commonly include headaches, viral infections and nausea (6). Both terbinafine and the azoles have a similar ability to prevent the recurrence of infection (6). Griseofulvin – has a similar cure rate to the azoles, but produces more side effects, including headaches, stomach disturbances, loss of taste, nausea, and allergic reactions (6).If you have a fungal nail infection there are oral antifungal medications available that may help cure the fungus and get you back to enjoying open toed shoes again!']"
221,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2018/02/26/how-do-older-adults-perceive-abuse,26 February 2018,How do older adults perceive abuse?,"['As more adults reach the point where they need help with personal care, finances, health and other basic needs of day-to-day living, the potential for them to become vulnerable and in a position to be abused is also rising.Abuse affects between four and 10 per cent of older adults in Canada, but it’s estimated only one in five incidents is reported to someone who can help (1).And it doesn’t just happen in care facilities where residents can be emotionally, physically or sexually abused by non-family caregivers, with the most egregious incidents often making media headlines. Family members who are caring for aging relatives can also be the perpetrators, sometimes without even realizing it.The World Health Organization defines elder abuse as “a single, or repeated act, or lack of appropriate action, occurring within any relationship where there is an expectation of trust which causes harm or distress to an older person” (2).So does anyone really know how big the problem is, or the best ways to address it?Many countries have recognized and acted on the need to protect vulnerable older adults, much in the way that they recognized decades ago that vulnerable children needed protection. In Canada, federal,\xa0provincial\xa0and\xa0territorial\xa0governments are investing in efforts to deal with elder abuse. Quebec recently passed an act to combat maltreatment of seniors and other persons of full age in vulnerable situations (3).However, addressing elder abuse is significantly different from addressing child abuse, and developing a clear description of elder abuse – and ultimately how it should be addressed - has been the subject of much debate.There has been a great deal of research in the past decade looking at the prevalence of elder abuse, victim profiles, types of abuse, and the initiatives to prevent or stop it.But what do the potential victims think of all this? Despite the volume of research on the subject, most of this work is professionally-driven, and little is known about older adults’ understanding of the term abuse, or what behaviours they consider to be abusive.A recent systematic review analyzed 15 studies that focused on how older adults conceptualize abuse (4). This review provides insight on how perceptions of abuse can vary between victims, those providing care, and those who develop policies related to protection.The 15 studies used a range of methods such as interviews and focus groups to gather the views and perceptions of participants. Most of the studies involved small numbers of participants, but there were two large surveys that compared the perceptions of older adults and professionals. Older adults can have complex and diverse perceptions about abuse, some of which are related to their personal experiences, such as age, gender, family relationships, cultural background and living conditions. And while their views generally align with professional definitions of abuse - emotional, financial, or physical abuse, as well as neglect – there are subtle but important differences in how older adults view the severity of such abuse, compared to professionals.For example, older adults who are vulnerable are perceived to experience abuse more severely, and older adults tend to view elder abuse as a more serious challenge than caregivers and healthcare providers.The review also noted that while concepts of abuse tended to focus on the family unit, the research also identified broader themes related to society’s attitudes towards family, gender, race and age that contributed to the way people view abuse and the abuse itself.Another key finding in the review is that some older adults do not understand the concept of abuse, particularly sexual and emotional. The review noted that raising awareness of elder abuse, both among the general public and the older population, is essential.The varied findings presented through this research illustrate the need for greater efforts to ensure the voices of older adults are heard and acted upon when it comes to addressing the problem of abuse. The way older adults view abuse – based on their backgrounds, beliefs and life experiences – must be taken into account by those who can help them.Prevention and protection services will only be effective if those receiving such services have a clear understanding of why these services are needed and how they work.With that information, policymakers will be better able to develop adult protection services that are based on a clear understanding of the needs and wishes of victims.']"

Get active and improve your health with high intensity interval training!,"['If you’re carrying a little extra weight, you probably already know that exercise will be important to achieving your weight loss goals. You may also feel overwhelmed by the many exercise fads and trendy workouts that promise to transform your body. And really, how could you possibly fit one more thing – exercise – into your already packed daily routine?The number of people who are overweight or obese has reached epidemic proportions (1). In 2014, 20.2% of Canadian adults – or 5.3 million people – were considered obese, while 40% of men and 27.5% of women were overweight (2). Being overweight or obese is not just about how you look. In addition to impacting daily life through symptoms like fatigue, joint pain and breathing difficulties (1), being overweight or obese puts you at increased risk of developing health problems such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease and cancer (1;2;3).So, what can people who are overweight or obese do to improve their health? The short answer is still…exercise! Unfortunately, the number one reason people say they can’t stick to an exercise regimen is that they’re just too busy (4). But what if the benefits of exercise could be achieved in less time (5)?Enter high-intensity interval training, or HIIT for short. Simply put, HIIT involves short bursts of intense exercise interspersed with longer periods of slower activity as recovery time (6). Some examples of HIIT include rotating between running and walking, sprint cycling and rest, or swimming and rest (5). But is HIIT the miracle that we have been looking for? Research shows that, in overweight and obese adults, both short-term and long-term HIIT can effectively decrease risk factors for chronic diseases such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes. After less than 12 weeks of HIIT, people who were overweight or obese saw improvements in their waist size, diastolic blood pressure and blood sugar. While blood sugar reductions were not sustained, people who practiced HIIT over the longer term (for 12 or more weeks) saw additional improvements in systolic blood pressure, percent body fat, and resting heart rate. Maximum benefit was achieved when HIIT was performed at least three times a week for 12 or more weeks (5).If you feel pressed for time, HIIT may offer an effective exercise alternative for improving health and reducing risk factors for chronic diseases in adults who are overweight or obese.']"

But when it comes to road safety, statistics show that both the youngest and oldest drivers among us are most at risk of being involved in motor vehicle accidents.And with the 65+ age group being the fastest growing segment of the population, the number of older drivers on the road is also increasing rapidly. As we grow older, we are increasingly at risk of developing a health condition that can affect our driving ability. For instance, theCanadian Automobile Association(CAA) notes that:- over the years our pupils get smaller and can affect our ability to drive safely;- hearing loss can affect our ability to react to our surroundings; and- diminishing motor skills can affect reaction time (1).There are many other more specific declines in health that seniors are at risk for that can affect the ability to drive, such as arthritis, strokes, heart conditions and cognitive conditions like dementia.So how does an older individual or their doctor, relatives or caregivers, know when it’s best for someone to hang up the car keys for good?Governments in many jurisdictions are grappling with this question, but given the wide range of abilities among older adults and the strong emotions associated with the ability to drive, there are no easy answers.Most jurisdictions in Canada and the U.S. have various policies regarding mandatory driver testing for older adults, as well as regulations that require medical professionals to report to driver licence authorities when someone is considered no longer fit to drive.In Canada, these rules vary by individual provinces and territories, and in the U.S. each state determines the rules. For instance, in Ontario all drivers aged 80 and over must renew their licence every two years. Since 2014, that renewal process has included a vision assessment, in-class group education, review of the driver's record and two short exercises, the latter to determine if further assessment is required. Ontario also hasdefinitive regulationsabout medical professionals reporting people who are no longer fit to drive, regardless of their age (2).Whether these policies are making the roads safer for all has been the subject of much discussion and research in recent years. A recent systematic review conducted in the U.S. and focused on policies to enhance older driver safety sheds some insight on their effectiveness in reducing motor vehicle crashes involving older adults (3).The review included 22 studies that looked specifically at licence renewal rules and seven studies focused on medical reporting of older adults who should no longer be driving. All studies involved people over the age of 65 and included some type of transportation-related outcome, such as rates of crashes, fatalities or renewal of licence. Not all states have policies requiring in-person licence renewals for older adults. However, the ones that do saw a 17% reduction in risk for fatal crashes among the oldest drivers.There is mixed evidence about the effectiveness of vision tests as part of the license renewal process. Several studies found that states that require vision tests as part of the licence renewal process have lowered the relative risk of fatal crashes. For instance, in Florida, after a new requirement for visual testing for older drivers was implemented, fatalities for drivers aged 80 and over decreased significantly, by 17%. However, a study examining 10 years of data across the U.S. found that vision tests for all older drivers do not offer independent benefits toward lowering fatal crash rates among older drivers.The review also included studies that examined other types of aged-based testing at licence renewal, such as cognitive or functional tests, but found little support for the effectiveness of these measures. Likewise, neither driver education programs or knowledge tests geared specifically to older adults produced any benefit for older drivers.The studies that looked at medical reporting found that these regulations were effective at removing unfit drivers from the road. However, only a small fraction of older drivers is ever the subject of a medical report, and there is limited research on the topic, so it wasn’t possible to determine if voluntary or mandatory medical reporting requirements were more effective at reducing fatalities. But both approaches were effective at forcing reported drivers to cease driving.It was also noted that many healthcare providers admit they are unsure about how, what, or when to submit a medical report. A survey of members of the American Geriatrics Society found that 87% felt obligated to assess driving competency, but only 40% had ever made a referral for a formal driving evaluation.""]"

How can we live independently, while maintaining an active social life and good cognitive health? Technology may be part of the answer.A study published by Statistics Canada reveals that 68% of those\xa065\xa0years of age and older  used the internet at least a few times a month. In addition,\xa0among\xa065- to\xa074-year-olds, internet use rose from\xa065% to\xa081% from\xa02013\xa0to\xa02016, while among those aged\xa075\xa0and older usage rose from\xa035% to\xa050% over these three years (2). Internet access encourages the practice of certain hobbies (for example, playing online, listening to music, and planning trips), helps to maintain connections with loved ones, and helps people keep abreast of current events. But other technologies requiring access to the internet can also contribute to optimal aging such as cognitive-skills games, virtual self-help groups or smoking-cessation apps.A systematic review of 53 studies published from 2002 to 2014 addresses the issue of social integration of older adults who use technologies, and identifies various resources and strategies (1). Do you know what 'ambient intelligence' is? Some companies use it to collect data on consumption patterns to improve their products and services. But ambient intelligence is much more than that; it's also a digital environment with several adaptive electronic devices that are aware of the users’ presence. Some of these technologies have been designed to promote independent living at home by helping older adults\xa0accomplish their daily tasks,\xa0promote cognitive stimulation,\xa0strengthen emotional bonds,\xa0promote physical activity, and also\xa0promote effective health care by monitoring vital signs and relaying information to parents and caregivers.The studies identified in this systematic review reveal that technologies that use ambient intelligence account for 62% of the technologies used to stimulate older adults' social participation, provide personal support, and support the delivery of care.Almost a third of studies mention the use of social networks as a mechanism to break social isolation: Facebook, the virtual world Second Life, etc. Networking sites and other such applications are becoming increasingly popular with older adults, who use them as a means of communication with family members and friends.New and emerging technologies come in a variety of forms: remote-controlled robots providing a physical presence for older adults; screens with dynamic content; wireless sensor networks in smart homes that control vital signs; mobile apps gathering information about physical activities done outside the home; interactive video games enhancing social interaction with family members and friends; and virtual environments where users socialize through representations of themselves (known as 'avatars').The review found that most electronic devices designed to break social isolation remain expensive and require complex adjustments or special adaptations to install them in older adults' homes. Social networking sites and  dynamic screens are  recommended instead because internet access is cheaper than before, applications can be installed on several types of devices (computers, tablets, laptops), their interfaces can be user-friendly and intuitive, and they allow for interactions in real time. The future is promising for some technologies that will be able to 'learn' from the data collected, such as recognizing patterns in the movements and language of their users, and thus alert caregivers and health professionals if problems are detected.Technologies play an increasingly important role in the lives of older adults. What was once science fiction now seems to be a reality. But remember, if technologies can help break the social isolation of older adults and improve the delivery of care, we need to ensure that they are aligned with their needs, values and preferences. And of course, these technologies will never completely replace human contact.""]"

Identify the risk of problem gambling among seniors,"['You may have heard about the organized bus tours for seniors to visit the casinos in the area, with transportation and meals paid. An Ontario study estimates that 30% of seniors who participate in these activities have moderate to severe gambling problems (1).Seniors sometimes have a lot of time to fill and taking part in these organized trips is an attractive way out of their isolation. What remains a hobby for the majority of them can, however, become a hell for some who are more at risk of developing an addiction.A systematic review of 25 studies was conducted to look at the prevalence of problem gambling among adults over 60, but also to identify the determinants and risk factors for problem gambling. Personal factors such as low income without the possibility of future earnings, social isolation, addiction to alcohol or other drugs, and physical or psychological health problems, make many seniors vulnerable. Anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder and having experienced stressful events increase the risk of problem gambling. Some studies indicate that single men under the age of 70 and socially isolated, as well as women over the age of 70, are at greater risk of problem gambling, especially if access to a casino is easy and frequent. The stress and lack of stimulation that some seniors experience can lead to an increased satisfaction response in the brain when they gamble, which increases the risk of addiction. The systematic review also reveals that seniors often have difficulty admitting that they have a gambling problem and believe they can manage it themselves. They are more likely to deny and hide their dependency or financial problems to conform to the expectations of society and their families.What are some initial steps towards addressing problem gambling among seniors? Informing them about the risks of problem gambling is important, as well as promoting other types of recreational activities to nurture social interaction and reduce isolation.']"

This chronic disease disrupts the body’s ability to regulate blood sugar and is a major cause of blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke, lower limb amputation, and even early death (1). The number of people living with diabetes worldwide is already at epidemic proportions and is predicted to rise even higher. In Canada, 3.4 million people – 9.3% of the population – were living with diabetes in 2015, with that figure predicted to grow to 5 million (12.1% of the population) by 2025 (2).While these are alarming facts, there are ways that you can avoid becoming a statistic and prevent diabetes and the challenges that go along with it.Think you’re not at risk? Some of the main risk factors for diabetes are overweight or obesity, consistently eating unhealthy foods, and leading a sedentary lifestyle, which can cause the amount of sugar in your blood to rise. Higher than normal blood sugar is called “pre-diabetes,” which can lead to diabetes over time (3). Recent research shows that combined diet and exercise programs can help otherwise healthy adults lower their risk of high blood sugar and prevent diabetes (4;5;6).Sure, you’ve heard it all before: eating right and exercising are good for you. But what exactly should you eat and do to avoid diabetes? Recent research provides some answers. What is a “healthy diet” when it comes to diabetes prevention? Restricting high calorie and high fat foods is a good first step, and research shows that low carbohydrate diets work to help decrease blood sugar (4;6;7;8). The Mediterranean Diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) Diet also help control blood sugar and reduce other risk factors associated with diabetes (9;10).As for exercise, the best choices are activities you enjoy, since you are most likely to keep doing them! For optimal results, try aerobic training which is proven to help regulate blood sugar; the benefits are even greater with higher intensity activity levels (6;11). And why not mix things up by taking a yoga class? There’s sound evidence that – among other benefits – yoga helps lower blood sugar (13;14).If you’re not already in the habit of eating well and exercising regularly, preventing diabetes is one more compelling reason to commit to those important lifestyle changes.']"

This will have an impact on the economic growth and sustainability of public pension schemes and the costs of public services, in particular.Yet, older workers have a lot to contribute to business and society in terms of productivity and knowledge. There are also many physical, psychological and social benefits to push the retirement age to later in life.But what can employers do to keep aging workers employed? A systematic review of 41 studies conducted in the United Kingdom examined what motivates older workers to remain in employment (3). Three main themes emerged from the literature: the nature of work that aging workers prefer, the culture and organizational values they seek, and the measures and job adjustments that facilitate their retention. Older workers usually have similar expectations as younger workers. They want to be recognized, respected and valued within their organization. They want to have autonomy, as well as stimulating and varied tasks. They expect their employers to be fair by offering career development opportunities to all employees, regardless of age.The review also revealed that older workers appreciate using their skills and competencies to act as mentors or team leaders. This helps to concretely recognize their experience, enhance their sense of being useful, foster better intergenerational relationships, and break down social isolation. The review also highlighted that older workers face different aging-related issues such as physical and psychological limitations and illnesses. Employers who allow part-time work or fewer full-time hours, and who offer psychological support, as well as ergonomic adjustments to work equipment, help to keep older adults working longer. The review shows that older female workers who are facing sexual harassment or social isolation at work are more likely to choose early retirement. Inclusive human resource policies and adequate management to maintain a positive work environment are paramount to support employees’ health and well-being. Employers: value the strengths of your older employees, be fair, take time to discuss each other's work aspirations, be as flexible as possible about work schedules and be inclusive. Your employees will feel respected, and you will reap significant benefits!""]"

The aging population is expected to generate growing demands for high-quality home-care services.Older adults also wish to participate actively in decisions that affect them, but they are sometimes vulnerable because of age or illnesses. Depending on others to carry out their daily activities or acknowledging the need for home-care services is not easy to accept. The delivery of home-care services should be done in accordance with the opinions and priorities of older adults. Unfortunately, governance and delivery arrangements for home-care services are often perceived as cumbersome, with little room for engaging clients to shape services based on their values and needs.A systematic review identified 12 studies published from 2009 to 2014, which examined how older people perceive their participation in decisions about their daily home-care services (1). The systematic review revealed four major themes related to the autonomy and organization of home-care services. Studies show that for many older adults, the home is a personal space that allows them to make decisions and gives them a sense of control and comfort. They do not hesitate to review the organization of their home in order to remain independent for as long as possible, as well as to preserve their privacy and autonomy. Thus, since it may help them stay at home, many older adults accept the presence of assistive, medical and technological devices to meet their needs and facilitate their daily care at home, even if it affects their living environment.Providers can greatly contribute to older adults’ comfort by paying attention to their opinions, priorities and ways of doing things in their home. However, in some cases, providers compromise older adults’ autonomy by acting rigidly and by not responding to the client’s needs and desires.Several studies have found that administration systems related to daily home-care services often limit the ability of older adults to make autonomous decisions. For example, older adults feel they have little control over services offered or care provided, and often feel that they only have some degree of control over the sequence of services provided.To improve the quality of life of older adults, let's listen to them! Keep in mind that they should be free to make decisions about their health and their lives, despite old age or illness. When you enter their home to provide care or services, do so with respect and empathy, adapting to their life context.Older adults are sometimes caught up in the administrative structure of home-care services and struggle both to receive help and to keep control over their own lives. Current research evidence points to the need for more flexible policies, procedures and guidelines on the delivery of home-care services to allow older adults to have a say about their needs and how to meet them.""]"

Along with promoting health and well-being, and helping to control body weight, eating a healthy diet can actually lower your chances of developing cancer as you age (1). Maybe you're already eating balanced, nutritious meals and snacks most of the time. But if your diet can benefit from a bit of a makeover, the good news is it isn't too late - and it really isn't too difficult - to make some important changes. In fact, cancer-fighting benefits can be realized from just two simple steps: 1. Eat more: Vegetables and fruits TheInternational Agency for Research on Cancerestimates that increasing vegetable and fruit intake could reduce your risk of cancer by 5-12% (1). Vegetables and fruits contain bioactive compounds, ingredients that have an effect on human tissues and cells. These compounds may play a role in reducing the risk of cancer in humans, particularly cancers of the mouth, esophagus, lung, and stomach (2). This research has led trusted organizations, like theWorld Cancer Research Fundand the American Cancer Society, to recommend at least five servings of non-starchy vegetables and fruits every day (2-4). Fibre Fibre is also important for more than just keeping things regular: it helps keep cancer at bay! Fibre intake is particularly important for reducing colorectal cancer risk (3). For every 10 grams of fibre eaten each day, the risk of colorectal cancer decreases by 12% in men and 8% in women (5). Happily, there are lots of tasty options for getting your fibre: for instance one medium pear contains about 5.5 grams of fibre, and half a cup of bran cereal contains 4.6 grams. More information about how to increase the fibre in your diet can befound here. 2. Eat less: Red and processed meats More recently, red meat (such as beef, pork and lamb) and processed meats (those with added preservatives, or that have been smoked, cured or salted such as ham, bacon, hot dogs and salamis) have been found to increase colorectal cancer risk. A review of research studies found that eating 100 grams of red meat or 50 grams of processed meat per day increases one's risk of bowel cancer by 20-34% and 23-45% respectively (6;7). When it comes to eating for optimal health and wellness, there is an overwhelming amount of information and advice - much of it contradictory, suspect and just plain weird! It's easy to become confused and discouraged. But the evidence-based recommendations outlined above are straight-forward, easy to follow and most of all, can potentially keep you cancer free.""]"

Exercise, that is. Whether you enjoy being physically active or you consider it a chore, you probably know how important it is to get regular exercise. The health benefits of exercise range from feeling and looking good, to strengthening your heart and other muscles, to resisting serious diseases - including cancer (1). Studies have consistently shown that moderate to vigorous physical activity is linked to a lower risk of colorectal and breast cancer (2) and can reduce your risk of dying of breast, prostate, colorectal and other cancers (3:4). How? One way is through weight maintenance. Exercise helps us to maintain a healthy body weight and (along with diet) can help people lose potentially harmful excess weight. Currently, more than 26% of Canadian adults are classified as obese (5), putting them at increased risk for breast, colorectal and other cancers (2). Physical activity also lowers inflammation and insulin levels, which in turn helps lower the risk of some cancers (3:4;6). Additionally, the more time you spend exercising, the less time you\'re sitting or lying still. Studies prove that a sedentary lifestyle is a significant risk factor for heart disease and cancer, among other serious health issues (7). So, how much is enough? The American Cancer Society recommends that we aim for at least 150 minutes of exercise at moderate intensity, or 75 minutes of vigorous activity each week (or a combination of these). If possible, it is better to spread your activity throughout the week (8). But if you\'re just getting back in the game (or on the track) and this sounds ambitious, start by doing what you can. Any increase in your normal level of activity is beneficial (8). You can gradually work up to the recommended levels but remember, being ""physically active"" doesn\'t mean you need to be an Olympic sprinter or marathon runner! Walking is a great option for many people but there are many others: swimming, riding a bike, dancing, playing a sport... as long as you\'re moving at a good and steady pace, it counts and will help keep you mobile and healthy. Still not sure how to get started and stay motivated? Here are some tips: Begin by choosing something you like to do (you\'re more likely to stick with something you enjoy) but be open to trying something new and mixing up your activities. Join the club!\xa0Being part of a walking or exercise group may encourage you to attend and participate in activities regularly, particularly if you enjoy the social benefits (9). Use an activity tracker. Devices - from simple pedometers to high tech wearables - let you monitor your progress. Studies show they can motivate people to exercise longer and/or at higher intensities (10). Consider finding apeer-led exercise program or peer-support programin your community. Peer-led exercise programs and peer-support programs may improve adherence to physical activity in older adults (11). Last but not least, be aware of how often and how long you are sedentary during the day (e.g. watching TV, relaxing, working on the computer etc.) and try to change your routines to make sure you get up and move regularly. Becoming more physically active is one way to reduce your risk of cancer, protect yourself against other health threats, and live a more vibrant, enjoyable life.']"

That sounds sensible, and is what we\'re already striving to do.But what else?!For instance, all those supplements and ""super foods"" we hear about - should we be stocking up on those too? In recent years there have been a flood of claims about the cancer prevention benefits of various vitamin and mineral supplements such as selenium, calcium, vitamins A, C and D, and various concentrated combinations of ""natural ingredients"". Apparently they\'ll help you drop weight effortlessly and reverse aging - in addition to preventing cancer! No doubt the messages are exaggerated, but is it all just hype? Should we take supplements anyway, on the off chance there\'s some benefit? Is there any harm in taking them? Fortunately for us, scientific and medical research teams have been working to answer such questions. Vitamins, minerals and other nutrients are essential to good health and can help combat cancer and other diseases (1) - but don\'t plan on getting them in pill form. So far, the research conducted to date has shown little to no cancer fighting benefits from taking mineral, vitamin and other dietary supplements (2-6). A few trials showed a slight benefit of certain nutritional combinations in helping prevent prostate cancer (7). But until further research proves otherwise, there is not enough evidence to justify spending money on supplements. In fact, there is evidence that dietary supplements can do more harm than good (3;6) - as in the case of beta carotene which has been shown to increase the risk of lung cancer in some people (3). Instead, reduce your risk of cancer by focusing on evidence-based nutrition strategies: eating at least five servings/2.5 cups of vegetables and fruits a day, getting adequate fibre, and limiting red and processed meats (1).

Many would agree that there truly is nothing better than relaxing outdoors, perhaps soaking up a few of those golden rays. But like most of the things we enjoy in life, moderation is the key and that\'s especially true when it comes to sun exposure. Skin cancer affects people of all ages and the main cause is exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR), primarily from the sun although tanning beds are another source (1;2). The most common type of skin cancer is basal cell carcinoma, followed by squamous cell carcinoma (1). Both of these ""non-melanoma"" types of cancer tend to grow slow and rarely metastasize (spread to other parts of the body), unlike melanoma (1). Melanoma is being diagnosed more frequently in both men and women (3). Can some deaths be prevented with screening and surveillance to detect cancer at the earliest stages? That\'s the subject of ongoing research but so far, the evidence isn\'t encouraging: one study found that screening programs had only a very small effect on the number of deaths due to skin cancer (4). How to practice safe sun So while people are still urged to have any unusual moles and growths checked, prevention remains the key to reducing skin cancer risk. Here are ways to keep a safe and respectable distance from the sun\'s powerful rays (5-9): Check the UV index on a daily basis, so you\'re aware of the strength of the sun’s rays. If it\'s a three or higher, take extra care to protect your skin (6). Limit the time you spend in the sun or avoid it altogether during the middle of the day (between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.), when the UV index tends to be higher in Canada (5;6). Cover up. Wear a hat, sunglasses and clothing designed to protect you from the sun\'s rays. Staying in the shade and covering up are more effective than sunscreen for reducing cancer risk (7). If you have to be exposed to the sun, use a water-resistant, broad spectrum sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30 and reapply frequently (5;6). Be particularly vigilant when you’re in or near water, sand or snow as they reflect the sun\'s rays (5). Don\'t assume you\'re safe when the temperature is low, the sun isn\'t out in full force or there\'s a cooling breeze: you don\'t have to be feeling the heat to suffer sunburn and skin damage (5)! Avoid use of tanning beds; studies show that tanning bed use increases your risk of melanoma by 16% (8;9). A deep tan may look attractive in the short term, but we know it\'s a sign of skin damage and a warning sign we need to heed if we want to avoid skin cancer.']"

But this is one of those cases where too much of a good thing can have bad consequences. Among all the other reasons for avoiding or limiting alcohol here\'s one you may not know - it can help reduce your risk of getting cancer (1-3). The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified alcohol as a ""carcinogen"", a substance that can cause cancer (1;2;4). How? There are several ways alcohol can increase cancer risk (1;4): By breaking down ethanol in alcoholic drinks to ""acetaldehyde"", a toxic chemical; acetaldehyde can damage both DNA and proteins Through a process called oxidation that can damage DNA and lipids (fats) By hampering the body\'s ability to break down and absorb nutrients needed to maintain health and fight disease By increasing blood levels of estrogen, a sex hormone linked to the risk of breast cancer Types of cancer that are especially impacted by alcohol include head and neck cancers (particularly involving the oral cavity), liver cancer, esophageal cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer (2). Additional studies continue to confirm the unhealthy relationship between alcohol and cancer. For example, ameta-analysisof 57 studies found that people who regularly drank 50 grams or more of alcohol a day (about three and half drinks) were one and a half times more likely to get colorectal cancer than non-drinkers or occasional drinkers (5). Isn\'t red wine supposed to be good for you? People are understandably confused by conflicting messages, such as the one about the heart healthy benefits of resveratrol which is found in red wine: research results about the heart benefits of alcohol are not conclusive. A study confirmed that moderate alcohol consumption may help lower the risk of some (not all) heart conditions. But it\'s a fine line: drinking any more than that will increase risk. And people who don\'t already drink are not advised to start (6). Avoiding alcohol is your safest option, but if you choose to drink, follow the recommended guidelines: no more than one drink a day for women, no more than two a day for men (7). ""Responsible"" drinking is imperative for social, economic, ethical, physical and legal reasons. Being aware of the association between alcohol and serious diseases, including cancer, may provide additional motivation to ""cut yourself off"" and enjoy a longer, healthier life.']"

That’s particularly valuable when you’re overwhelmed or trying to do something especially challenging – like quitting smoking.Smoking rates have been gradually declining: in ten years the percentage of Canadians age 12 and over who smoked dropped from 20.8% in 2005 to 17.7% in 2015 (1;2). It’s an encouraging trend, but that still translates into roughly 5.3 million Canadians who are lighting up occasionally, if not every day (1).If you’re one of them, you probably don’t need to be told – yet again – the many ways smoking impacts your health and endangers your life. Cancer, heart disease, several serious chronic conditions, early death (2)… the list goes on. You know you should quit; perhaps you’ve tried to in the past and maybe you’ve made promises to loved ones, or to yourself, that this is the year you’re going to butt out for good. But it’s hard!Research has shown that nicotine can be as addictive as heroin and cocaine (2;3). Many people who manage to stop smoking for a while end up starting again due to stress and severe withdrawal symptoms including strong cravings, hunger (and resulting weight gain from eating more), feeling irritable, angry and/or anxious, and difficulties with thinking (3;4;5).Despite that, many people can – and do – quit successfully. And you don’t have to do it alone! There are several treatment options available, including group therapy for people who like the idea of “support in numbers.” Typically, participants meet regularly for sessions led by a facilitator trained in smoking cessation counseling. Group members share experiences and receive additional encouragement from others struggling with the same challenges in their quest to become smoke free (6). What are the chances that might work for you? Group therapy really does help people quit smoking!Research shows that compared with “self-help” (e.g. receiving smoking cessation literature), those who took part in group-based programs were 50% to 130% more likely to successfully quit smoking (6). Group programs delivered in the workplace turned up similar results (7). Group therapy may be used together with drug or nicotine replacement therapy (6;8).Group therapy and other types of smoking cessation programs are widely available in most communities and are usually free of charge. If you’re interested, check with your local hospitals, health units or community centres to find out your options and get details. There are even online programs that may suit your needs. Click here for information about programs and supports offered by the Canadian Cancer Association’s Smokers’ Helpline:http://www.smokershelpline.ca/home.When it comes to becoming smoke free, remember the old saying: “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again!” Quitting smoking may be difficult, but it can be done.

Research evidence revealed that chronic loneliness increases the risk of dying by accident or suicide, heart disease, diabetes, cancer or infectious diseases (2).Volunteering is a form of civic engagement that builds on the experience of older adults and breaks down social isolation, while providing them with a sense of accomplishment and belonging to the community. This feeling is accompanied by positive benefits for their health and quality of life.A systematic review of 27 studies was conducted to identify factors influencing the engagement of older adults as volunteers, including factors related to each individual, their daily activities, and their broader environment, as well as to identify concrete ways to facilitate the recruitment of seniors and maintain their participation in volunteer activities (3). Why do older adults become volunteers? To help others, to contribute to society, to meet people and to be part of social groups, which are often grounded in their values and interests. What are their characteristics? They often have better physical and psychological health, as well as greater satisfaction with life. Their life experiences usually guide them towards voluntary activities. Studies also show that being younger, being a woman and having a higher level of education are factors that encourage engagement as volunteers.What makes it easier for older adults to volunteer? Make sure they can travel to volunteer activities easily, by public transit, for example. The presence of a friend in these activities, being relatively financially well off, and being in a relationship are other factors related to the social environment that have a positive impact on their engagement. However, having large families appears to be associated with older adults having less time available to devote to volunteering. In addition, organizations seeking volunteers must make themselves known, offer a variety of opportunities for older adults and ensure flexible schedules.Among the factors related to how seniors spend their time, note that those who volunteer tend to participate more often in other types of community activities, and have more leisure time than those who are not engaged in volunteering activities. Also, working part-time or not having a paid job facilitates their engagement.You want to recruit older volunteers? Make yourself known and give them challenging tasks that will meet their needs, interests and abilities. Do not hesitate to solicit your older volunteers to recruit friends or acquaintances, and offer them continuing training and recognition!Are you a social worker?

Chances are cancer has affected your life in some way or another - either due to your own diagnosis or that of family members and friends. Thanks to medical advancements, many types of cancer can be effectively treated. Still, cancer remains the leading cause of death in Canada (2). Fortunately, there are a number of strategies you can use to reduce your risk. In fact, 41% to 63% of all cancer cases in women and men are preventable, according to a recent study (3). Here are six scientifically proven strategies for lowering your chance of getting cancer. Stay physically active If it seems like the solution for everything health related is exercise, that's because it is a key to maintaining function. Our bodies were designed to move and when our muscles (including our heart) aren't maintained properly through physical activity, we put ourselves at great health risk. Aim for at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity (such as brisk walking) every day to reduce your risk of cancer (4). Maintain a healthy body weight More than 20% of Canadian adults have obesity (5), putting them at significantly greater health risk for other chronic and serious diseases, including cancer. One way to maintain a healthy body weight is through a combination of exercise (see above) and a healthy diet (see below). Eat for optimal health Dietary recommendations from the World Cancer Research Fund/American Institute for Cancer Research include eating at least five servings of a variety of non-starchy vegetables and/or fruits every day and avoiding, or at least limiting, red meat and processed meat (4). Limit your alcohol Happy hour sounds like good times, but alcohol is arisk factorfor certain types of cancer. If you must drink, do so within recommend limits (4). Practice safe sun Skin cancers are extremely common and can be serious (1). Most are the result of too much exposure to the sun and people with a history of severe sunburns are most at risk (6). Butt out! Most people know smoking is bad for you. How bad? Tobacco use is the single greatest avoidablerisk factorfor death due to lung cancer, and roughly 80% of lung cancers could be prevented if smoking was eliminated (3). Do these tips sound familiar? No doubt you've heard them before but they bear repeating and are definitely worth heeding! It's never too late to make lifestyle changes that will help you stay healthy and active, while reducing your risk of cancer and other serious diseases.""]"

If so, that’s good! Walking speed and “gait” (pattern and manner of walking) are important for optimal aging (1;2). Whether you realize it or not, you may be training yourself for a longer, healthier and more active lifestyle by listening to music while you walk. Walking ability is one of the many changes affected by aging. Your pace may drop and your steps become shorter and less certain (3;4). These changes can lead to decreased mobility, a decline in quality of life, and increased risk of falls and serious injury (1;2). Walking speed reveals a lot about your overall health and energy and is a good predictor of how long you will be able to stay active, mobile and to live well independently in the community (5). Studies have also shown a connection between walking speed and how long you live (6). But don’t accept a change in walking ability as part of normal aging! You can “take steps” to avoid or minimize mobility problems and one interesting approach for improving walking speed, strength and coordination involves walking in time to a steady beat (7;8). Sounds simple enough, but will it really help? Lace up those shoes and turn on the tunes! Research shows that walking to a steady beat or music helps improve walking speed, stride length, walk rhythm and symmetry (7;8). These encouraging results are supported by other studies about the benefits of music, particularly for people who have had a stroke (8;9). How fast should you be able to walk? Older adults should be able to manage most day to day activities – including safely crossing a two-lane street – with a walking speed of about one metre per second, or about 10 seconds from one side of the street to the other (10). Check out this blog for more information, including usual walking speeds for men and women at different ages and tips for how you can test your own walking speed: How fast should I walk to cross the road safely? Fast facts about walking speed Worried you might be falling behind? Try picking up the pace and lengthening your stride by matching your steps to a steady tempo. You can literally “walk to the beat of your own drum,” but an iPod or similar small electronic device will be a lot less cumbersome! Choose music you like with a distinct and steady rhythm, making sure the volume still allows you to hear traffic and other noise around you. Then, go out and enjoy your walks even more knowing you are taking steps towards better health and longevity.']"

So you get your travel insurance, necessary vaccinations, pick up essential supplies and pack good footwear. While you’re at it, consider getting a pair of compression stockings – another way to reduce potential travel-related problems. Compression stockings are most commonly worn by people with blood circulation problems and therefore at risk of conditions such as blood clots in the legs (also known as deep vein thrombosis - DVT). Symptoms of DVT include swollen or painful calves or thighs, redness, fever and skin discolouration, although sometimes there aren’t obvious or noticeable symptoms. Left untreated, a blood clot can break off, travel to the lungs, and cause death (1;2;3). One of the main risk factors for DVT is long periods of inactivity – such as a long airplane flight (3;4). Compression socks or stockings fit tightly, particularly at the ankle, and that gentle pressure encourages the flow of blood to deep veins, which in turn prevents blood from pooling and clotting, reducing the risk for DVT (2;5). Are they worth buying or is the money better spent on a snazzy new travel pillow? Research evidence shows that wearing compression socks or stockings during flights lasting more than 5 hours helps reduce DVT in people who show no symptoms. Compression socks and stockings may also help reduce leg swelling, discomfort, and blood clots from forming near the skin’s surface. The research also shows that compression stockings are generally safe to use with little risk of harm associated with wearing them (2). However, they are not cheap (ranging from $10 to $100 depending on the type) so whether they’re a good investment for you depends on your preferences and risk factors for DVT (1). Other risk factors for DVT include being elderly, obese, pregnant, a smoker, or having cancer or one of several chronic diseases (3;6). It never hurts to seek advice from your doctor, especially as there are some people who should not wear compression stockings, such as those with nerve damage, common in people with diabetes (1). Other tips for preventing circulation problems while en route include standing up and walking around periodically, drinking water and doing leg-stretching exercises (6). As for the pillow – it probably won’t do anything to prevent DVT, but it might help you be more comfortable during the flight. Happy travels!']"

In Canada, people aged 25 to 54 – who are considered the ‘core’ working age group – made up just 49% of the population in 2016, a drop of 5% in just 10 years, according toStatistics Canada. That proportion is expected to decline further, to as low as 46% by 2026 (1).Meanwhile, the proportion of people aged 55 and older continues to grow, and since this age group is less likely to stay in the workforce, this shift in demographics could create challenges for the Canadian economy.Many other countries face similar challenges, and extending the working life of capable adults is increasingly important for sustaining healthy economies that benefit all citizens.Some workers end up leaving the workforce earlier than what would have been considered their natural retirement date due to a disability. In these cases, is it possible some of those disabilities could have been prevented through better workplace conditions?A recent systematic review identified 39 studies that analyzed a variety of workplace conditions. This review compiled information on which psychological, social and organizational factors are most likely to contribute to an employee’s decision to choose disability retirement (2). For this review, disability was defined as the general inability to perform one’s job, due to physiological problems, difficulty in performing specific tasks, or problems while participating in tasks or social relations associated with work.The studies in the review looked at factors such as job demands (both physical and psychological), how much control workers had over how they performed their jobs, monotonous work, social support, working hours, organizational changes such as downsizing, development and training, and imbalances between efforts and rewards.Overall, the review found that having low control over your work situation was the factor most commonly associated with subsequent disability. Twenty-four of the 39 studies addressed aspects of job control, which pertained to the freedom to choose between alternatives within one’s job. These studies involved a variety of occupations in Nordic countries, including nurses, municipal and civil service employees, waste collectors and farmers. Aspects of job control, such as job-decision latitude and skill discretion, were associated with disability retirement in 18 of the 24 studies.Job strain, described as a combination of a high level of demand and low level of control, was another significant predictor of disability retirement, according to four of six studies in the review that looked specifically at that factor. However, there was very limited evidence that job demands in general predicted disability retirement.One finding that may seem surprising to some was that there was limited evidence to suggest that evening and night work, shift work, or long hours (more than 60 a week), led to early retirement due to disability.There was also limited evidence that downsizing, organizational change, lack of employee development, repetitive tasks, or effort-reward imbalances were predictors of disability retirement. However, the authors cautioned that additional research may be required to confirm these findings.The results of this review illustrate that there are many factors that can play a role in an employee’s decision to leave the workforce early due to some form of disability. Some of these factors could be mitigated through supervisors, workplace leaders and business owners becoming more aware of and implementing changes to the working environment.']"

Donât let a dementia diagnosis keep you out of the conversation,"['Dementia is so prevalent that chances are if you don’t already have or care for someone who has the condition, you know someone who does. At least 47 million people are currently living with some degree of dementia worldwide, with close to 10 million new cases every year (1), most of them caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s (2). The reality is that for many of us, it is just a matter of time before we – or someone close to us – shows signs and symptoms of dementia, including memory loss and/or difficulties with thinking, problem solving or language. One of the most distressing aspects of dementia is losing the ability to reason and communicate, and therefore no longer able to care for ourselves and make our own decisions. Family members and caregivers, may feel the need to step in to perform tasks and make decisions on behalf of loved ones with dementia. But a person living with dementia is still living! Dementia is a progressive condition that affects everyone differently as they move through the various stages at their own pace (2). Many people can maintain much independence and autonomy after diagnosis, including being involved in decision-making about their own health and well-being (3). This means there are strategies that people diagnosed with dementia can use to improve their own health, and approaches that caregivers and healthcare providers can use to assist in the provision of better care. Staying engaged is important! A dementia diagnosis should not exclude someone from the conversation. In fact, the research evidence shows that people with dementia have the ability to learn and retain new information when it’s presented in a way they can understand (4). A person with dementia will enjoy better health and a better quality of life if they’re involved in their own care and when their needs and wishes are understood by those helping them (5;6). For example, risk of falling is greater for people with dementia (7). Studies show falls are most likely to be prevented if the individuals themselves and their caregivers weigh in on falls prevention strategies, including their personal preferences and capabilities (8). Speaking up, sharing stories and socializing can also help ward off social isolation and depression (9) – common issues for many people after a dementia diagnosis. Of course, it goes both ways. Declining cognitive abilities mean that caregivers and healthcare providers need to adapt too and adopt strategies that meet the changing needs of those with dementia. For example a “person-centred” care model, which emphasizes the needs, preferences, abilities and values of the individual, has proven to help reduce agitation in people with dementia (10), relieve stress and burnout for caregivers (11) , and increase family members’ confidence that they’re making appropriate decisions on behalf of their loved one (6). Individuals diagnosed with dementia shouldn’t give up and should advocate for themselves as part of the conversation! There are supports and strategies that can help those diagnosed as well as their caregivers, family members and healthcare professionals prepare for the changes to come (2) while allowing the individual to continue living a full, active and independent lifestyle for as long as possible.']"

You may even begin making plans for a future trip. Not so when it comes to a hospital stay: whether it was a scheduled surgery or a sudden health scare that took you there, once you’ve been treated and are cleared to leave you’re not planning to come back anytime soon! Yet many do, and often (1). Frequent use of emergency department and other hospital services has major implications for healthcare systems but also for the patients who tend to have ongoing health problems and a lower life expectancy (2). Since many repeat hospital visits are due to fear, compounded by uncertainty about what to do and expect after going home (3) it’s essential that patients receive clear instructions and have access to the appropriate follow-up care. Want to avoid repeat trips to the hospital? The following evidence-based tips are a great starting point. Click on the links for details about the related studies. 1.\xa0 Predict your risk In Canada, nearly one in ten acute-care patients return to the emergency department after leaving the hospital (4). Some people – including older adults– are more likely to be among that 10% (5). Your age, medical condition, chronic diseases and other factors can put you at higher risk and in need of extra support and strategies for staying well while staying away from the hospital. Research evidence shows that tools such as theIdentification of Seniors At Risk(ISAR) andProbability of Repeated Admission (Pra)can help predict when you’re ready to go home from the hospital and if you’re at high risk of returning (6;7). While these tools are intended for health care professionals, you can advocate for your own care by asking about your risk and what it means for your discharge and care needs. 2.\xa0 Make a care plan A comprehensive, tailored care plan– based on your health history and unique circumstances – is an important step towards a successful recovery and reduces the risk of suffering complications that could send you back to hospital. Discharge care plans include clearly outlined steps to follow once you leave the hospital and are an effective way to avoid going back (8). In some cases the plan will involve “case management” in which members of multidisciplinary teams (doctors, nurses, psychologists, social workers etc.) play a role in developing and carrying out the care plan. Don’t leave the hospital without asking your healthcare providers about developing an appropriate discharge plan that will meet your unique needs. 3.\xa0 Recruit your pharmacist Older adults and others who take multiple medications are at risk of serious side effects due to drug interactions, which can result in a trip to the hospital. It’s a good idea toget a pharmacist involved even before leaving the hospitalto conduct a medication review and give you instructions about your prescriptions, including the correct timing and dosage (9). Once at home, keep your pharmacist in the loop by keeping track of any medications you’re taking and how often, asking for advice and pamphlets about your prescriptions, and enlisting their help to dispose of any unused or expired medications. 4.\xa0 Access post-treatment care Sometimes recovery includes follow-up care delivered by medical professionals. But that doesn’t always have to be in a hospital setting.Home visiting programsand transitional care ornurse-led clinicsare effective options for people recovering from heart failure and with other conditions (10-13). For people living in areas without specialty clinics or services, support by telephone can work well to check on your condition and you help manage symptoms and recovery. 5. \xa0 Commit to making lifestyle changes Often, an unplanned hospital visit is a “wake-up call” for people whose diagnosis was complicated by poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, substance use or a combination of life-style factors. It’s never too late to make changes that will improve your health and your life – and keep you away from the emergency room.

Take steps to support healthy aging Don’t go until you know If you have to spend time in the hospital, ideally it’s a short stay involving a successful and effective treatment. You may be eager to get back home, but before you’re discharged, make sure you have the information you need and fully understand all the components of your care plan. By preventing a repeat visit to the hospital you’ll have the time and energy to plan more enjoyable trips for when you’re fully recovered!']"

Video games can help!,"['Play is important for children because it promotes learning and helps them develop new skills and abilities… but kids play just because it’s fun! As adults we’re really not so different; if it weren’t for our ‘grown-up’ responsibilities we just might play games for hours on end too. Encouraging adults to play is the premise behind play-based therapy for patients with acquired brain injury due to stroke or trauma to the head, such as a car accident or fall. Standard rehabilitation programs for regaining brain function often include intensive, repetitive training: doing the same thing over and over, frequently and for long durations. It can work but it’s time consuming, can be boring, and many patients don’t stick with the programs (1). But if those movements are done during the course of a fun or interesting game, people may be inclined to “play” longer and more often, ideally resulting in faster and better recovery. Technology-based games and virtual reality gaming systems are popular options for therapy, especially as they’ve become more available and affordable in recent years (2). There are all sorts of games to choose from and various gaming devices (handheld remotes, balance boards, etc.) that track and record movement. Most systems motivate players through feedback (displaying scores) and encouraging them to reach the next goal or level (2). It may be a preferred type of therapy for people who suffer a brain injury, but does playing video games really help aid recovery? Asystematic reviewof 30 studies compared the use of electronic gaming systems with usual (not play-based) treatment or no treatment (3). Participants had adult-acquired brain injuries, most commonly as a result of a stroke. The study groups played video/electronic and virtual reality games for 30 to 60 minutes at a time, three to five times a week, for up to nine weeks. The studies measured the effects of a variety of game systems, including the Nintendo Wii (WiiSports or WiiFit), Sony Playstation Eyetoy, Xbox Kinect and virtual reality games designed for rehabilitation (eg. IREX VR). Whether or not the participants won the championship, saved the (virtual) world or reached some other lofty goal, the important thing is they enjoyed trying and they benefited from spending time playing the games. There was sound evidence that technology-based games and activities promote greater independence and better balance, and are more effective than standard types of rehabilitation and treatment (3). Another systematic review found that virtual reality and interactive video games improve arm function in stroke survivors, as well as the ability to perform day-to-day tasks (4). Further research will help clarify the most effective play-based activities and their potential benefits. If you enjoy video or computer games, you know how easily you can lose track of time as you try to beat your personal best. You might think of it as a “guilty” pleasure, but a little playtime may be good (even for grown-ups) and perhaps especially for people coping with the effects of a brain injury. Ask your rehabilitation therapist for ideas about which games might help speed your recovery.']"

Mindfulness may be the solution,"['If you’ve been paying attention to what’s been happening on the health and wellness front, you’re probably aware of the growing interest in “mindfulness.” The practice has roots in Buddhism and involves non-judgmental and moment-to-moment awareness of thoughts, feelings, sensations and surroundings (1). It usually includes meditation (which strengthens the ability to be in the present and not get distracted by\xa0negative thoughts of the past or worries about the future) but goes beyond that to encourage greater awareness and appreciation of what’s taking place in the present while engaging in routine activities. Mindfulness training is at the core of popular programs for treating psychological issues and promoting mental health and well-being. Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (1) and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (2) are two such programs which have several adaptations for specific needs, including weight management (3;4). A safe, non-invasive and drug-free way to lose weight would definitely be a game changer: overweight increases the risk of serious chronic diseases such as heart attack, stroke and diabetes and close to 34% of Canadian adults are overweight (5). Adults with obesity and overweight have often tried – and failed – to lose weight many times (6). Is a solution really as simple as learning to “live in the moment”? Onesystematic reviewof 12randomized controlled trialsaimed to answer that question, assessing the effects of mindfulness training on the eating and exercise behaviours of adults with obesity or overweight (7). Participants took part in training sessions for up to 24 weeks, after which their body mass index (BMI), episodes of impulsive and binge eating, and physical activity levels were measured and compared tocontrol groupswho received no mindfulness training. Participants who practiced mindfulness reported a considerable reduction in impulsive and binge eating and an increase in the time they spent exercising. There was no significant change in BMI between the study and control groups and the review authors suggest that may be due to the relatively short length of the studies. Significant weight loss doesn’t happen quickly, and – noting that longer studies did improve BMI – the authors suggest that most of the included studies did not measure weight and BMI changes over a long enough time for the decrease in calories and increase in physical activity to measurably affect body weight or composition. Further study is urged but the evidence from these and other reviews shows that mindfulness is a promising way to help change behaviours and break long-held habits. Curious and interested in giving mindfulness a try? One way to get started is by registering for an online mindfulness program. Studies show they can reduce stress among other mental health issues (8).']"

Our bones become more fragile as we age, and breaking a bone is an indicator that you’re more likely to break another. For example, breaking a hip increases your risk of another break by 2.5 times (1). Before a nasty fall or accident has you cooped up, prepare yourself. Below are five recommendations froma reporton best practices for treating broken bones and preventing future fractures in people over the age of 50 (2). These tips can help you reduce your risk of breaking a bone, and give you the “inside scoop” on how to ensure the best possible recovery if it does happen. 1. Don’t “wait and see” – get medical help! You’ve heard the saying: If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it. However when it comes to major bumps and bruises, it’s actually good advice to get medical attention as soon as possible! Maybe you dread the hassle of an emergency room visit for a twisted ankle or bruised wrist, but you’re best to play it safe. If it is a broken bone or “fragility fracture” (particularly common in people over the age of 50 who are at greater risk of osteoporosis), getting surgery or other treatment within 48 hours leads to the best results and shorter recovery (2). 2. Find the right treatment for you There’s usually more than one way to do anything, and that includes treating broken bones. So while surgery is often performed, in some cases it’s not the recommended course of action. For example, studies have found that older adults who suffer upper arm breaks at the shoulder (the humerus) may be treated just as effectively with non-surgical procedures (3). Ask for patient education materials to find out your options and work with your health care providers to determine the best one for your individual circumstances.  Online tools, such as Patient Decision Aids, are a great starting point for learning the pros and cons of different treatments. Check out these Decision Aids on the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal: Managing pain from a broken hip: A guide for adults and their caregivers Reducing the Risk of Bone Fracture: A Review of the Research for Adults With Low Bone Density Preventing blood clots after hip or knee replacement surgery or surgery for a broken hip: A review of the research for adults 3. Do your rehabilitation and prevention exercises You suffered a fall and broke a bone or two. But you’ve had treatment and rested for the recommended amount of time so that’s the end of it, right? Nope. Actually, now the real work begins. Seek a personalized assessment by a doctor or specialist and then work with your care providers to develop an action plan that will both speed recovery and help prevent future falls (4). Depending on your situation and needs, it may include physical therapy, and exercise—such asbalance exercisesand/orstrength training—among\xa0other activities (4-6). 4. Some lifestyle changes and medications can help build healthier bones No one likes to admit they’re getting older and can’t do the same things they did in their 20s and 30s. The good news is we can remain active and enjoy a full life as we age. A few lifestyle changes—such as quitting smoking and reducing alcohol consumption—can promote overall health while helping to strengthen bones and prevent breaks (2). Bisphosphonates are a class of drug that help maintain bone mass and are used to treat osteoporosis among other conditions. There is evidence they reduce the risk of fractures, with different types appearing to be more effective for women and men and for specific kinds of fractures. In women with osteoporosis, denosumab, teriparatide, and some bisphosphonates reduce spinal and non-spinal fractures (7). Check out these Decision Aids around medication on the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal: Osteoporosis: Should I Take Bisphosphonate Medicines? Should I take risedronate (Actonel®) for osteoporosis? Should I take Etidronate (Didronel®) for osteoporosis? Should I take alendronate (Fosamax®) for osteoporosis? 5. Know your risk, plan ahead The information and suggestions above are a good starting point for everyone. What else can you do? One of the best ways to protect yourself is to be proactive (2). Make an appointment with a health care professional who specializes in osteoporosis and who can assess your risk based on your age, health, mobility, previous falls and/or fractures, medications and other factors (8;9).']"

With names like atorvastatin (Lipitor®) and rosuvastatin (Crestor®) the drugs’ ultimate purpose is to lower the risk of heart attack and stroke. They are generally “well tolerated,” meaning the majority of people don’t have problems taking them (4;5). And recent research suggested that statins may have another benefit: lowering the risk of dementia. With the number of people with dementia already at an alarming high and predicted to double every 20 years (6), getting Alzheimer’s or a related disease has become one of our greatest health fears. A pill that wards off both heart disease and dementia would definitely be a “two-for-one” deal worth getting excited about! But do statins really help to prevent dementia? Observational studies have produced mixed results: a few early studies reported a significant preventative benefit (7;8) but others since were much less encouraging. Large-scalerandomized controlled trialsare challenging for such a complex topic, but the authors of arecentsystematic reviewfound two, involving a total of 26,340 participants aged 40 to 82, almost half of them age\xa070 and over (9). They were given one of two different statins, monitored and assessed over a three to five year follow-up period, and compared with people incontrol groupswho were given aplacebo. What did they find? Disappointingly, there was no evidence that statins have any effect in preventing cognitive decline or dementia (9). If your doctor has prescribed statins, take them. And while you’re at it, take any advice offered about lifestyle changes including diet and exercise. The pills alone may not be a magic solution for avoiding dementia but maintaining a strong, healthy heart and body will always have benefits.']"

Some people can’t live without their phone, while others struggle to remember where it is… or how to turn it on! Regardless of your level of dependency, mobile phones can provide easy access to your personal contacts, directions, even entertainment. And – importantly – they can also help improve and maintain health while supporting your goals of aging optimally. Here are some of the best evidence-based ways your phone can help keep you healthy. Click on the links for more information about recent research and the study findings. 1.  Assistance to manage your medications We’re all human, which means we can make mistakes or forget to do things. But some slip-ups have serious consequences, such as forgetting to take medications properly (or at all), a common problem for many people. Text message reminders delivered via mobile phone canhelp ensure medications are taken as directed(1). 2.  Motivation to stay focused and on track We can all use a little help and encouragement sometimes, especially when the going gets tough, like when we’re struggling to quit smoking, eat well or manage our weight. There are many health ‘apps’ available that send information, reminders and motivational messages to our phones and research evidence shows this approach can keep us from getting discouraged as we work toward our goals, includingsmoking cessation(2) andweight loss(3). 3.  Support for managing chronic conditions Chronic diseases like type 2 diabetes, which involve ongoing monitoring, can be challenging for people to manage effectively. Studies show that mobile phone applications\xa0(aka “apps”) that involve inputting information (e.g. blood glucose readings, food intake etc.) and receiving personalized feedback helpimprove blood sugar levels(4).Dietary mobile appswith a focus on self-monitoring may also help folks with chronic diseases reduce their weight, waist circumference, and calorie consumption in the short-term (5).Electronic toolscan even work hand in hand with strategies such as home exercise. People with osteoarthritis of the knee engaging in this combined strategy can experience short and long-term improvements in pain, physical function, and health-related quality of life by a small amount. Compared to other electronic tools, mobile apps are especially effective (6). “Telemedicine” is also a time- and cost-effective way to support people recovering from diabetes-related problems such asfoot ulcers(7). Telephone monitoring and support can also be effective for people recovering fromstroke(8) andheart failure(9). Automated telephone communication systems (ATCS), can help patientsmanage long-term conditionsand encourage people to take preventive measures (screenings, immunizations, follow-up appointments etc.) (10). 4.  Socialization: talk, laugh, share Let’s not forget the original use of a phone: to connect and communicate with others! Relationships and contact with people contribute to a full, balanced and healthy life; conversely people who are socially isolated – including many older adults – are at risk of poor health. Telephones and other communication technology can help alleviateloneliness and a sense of isolation(11). 5.  Access to your health records What does the future hold for technology to monitor, maintain and/or improve your health? There is growing interest in making Personal Health Records (PHR) electronically available for people who want secure online access to their medical files in order to take greater responsibility and advocate for their own healthcare. Further research willclarify if and how PHRs impact overall health(12). 6.

But that startling bit of trivia is cold comfort when you’re laid up with a stiff, sore and aching back. However, there are ways to get relief. Here are some treatments and strategies that show promise for reducing pain and disability caused by low back pain. Click on the links to read the research evidence. Remedies that don’t involve drugs (which come with the risk of side effects) are often the first line of defense when it comes to pain relief, particularly for chronic, long term low back pain. A recentsystematic reviewassessed the impact of various types of therapies on pain levels and function in adults with low back pain (2). The good news is that many of them really do help – at least in the short term – and can reduce pain by a small to moderate amount. The greatest effects were observed when participants practiced yoga and other types of motor control exercises (e.g. Tai Chi), or engaged in relaxation/stress reduction techniques. There was also evidence that acupuncture, massage and rehabilitation can help relieve pain (2). This review reinforces recommendations that people experiencing back pain should move, stretch and perform certain types of exercise – even though their inclination might be to just rest. Other studies have shown thatstrength/resistance training(3),balance/coordination exercises and yoga(4) help to alleviate back pain, strengthen muscles and improve mobility. Over the years, various types of pain killers and muscle relaxants have been prescribed for chronic low back pain, but they don’t consistently work well for everyone or help avoid the risks of back surgery (5). Recently, valuable new evidence came out of asystematic reviewthat examined the effectiveness of eight different classifications of drugs in reducing low back pain (6). For people who do not respond to non-drug approaches (which are recommended as a first line of treatment), the recommendation is to try NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) for either acute or chronic pain. As a second choice, duloxetine, a type of antidepressant, was shown to help relieve chronic back pain. Opioids may also help reduce back pain, but have higher risks of side effects, addiction and overdose. While the included studies did not assess risks for harm, the review authors acknowledge theconcerns and controversy surrounding the use of opioidsfor chronic pain (6;7). The review also found that acetaminophen does not relieve acute back pain and that NSAIDs are not as effective as previously believed (6), which is consistent with other recent studies. Some types of NSAIDs may be more effective than others (for example, recent research shows“nonselective” NSAIDs have more risks and fewer benefits) (8). Ask your doctor or pharmacist what type of medications you are prescribed for your pain and advice about weighing the risks vs. benefits for your situation. Although low back pain afflicts the majority of adults, so far there is no magic cure that will work for all. The best strategy may involve a combination of non-drug therapies, with or without a prescription drug. Work with your doctor to develop a personalized plan for managing your back pain and getting on with your active life.']"
249,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2017/07/31/does-menu-labelling-affect-food-choices,31 July 2017,Does menu labelling affect food choices?,"['Imagine you’ve had a busy morning, you’re hungry and opt to grab some lunch at a restaurant around the corner. You’re about to order when you notice the menu board includes the calorie counts for each item. Yikes! You realize that little meal is going to account for almost half your daily calorie requirements! \xa0Do you choose something lighter – or do you shrug, sigh and proceed with your original order? That’s what researchers examining the impact of menu labeling would like to know. In recent years, menu labels – including nutrition information about menu items – were introduced in North America in response to what is seen as a direct correlation between rising rates of obesity and increasing reliance on restaurants (1;2). Eating out may be convenient but there’s a health-related catch: people who frequently eat at fast food restaurants are likely to gain weight (3) as portions tend to be large and many of the menu options include high amounts of calories, fat, sodium and added sugars (4). Menu labeling is designed to help people make more informed food choices and ideally, encourage healthier selections (5). Is it working? To help answer that,asystematic reviewof 17 studieslooked into whether menu labeling influences the types of food ordered and the amount of calories people eat in restaurants and cafeterias (6). The evidence shows that posting ""informative"" labels such as the calorie counts of menu items does not appear to be enough to influence food choices (6). Calorie counting can be challenging and requires a high level of “health literacy” not to mention mental math skills. However, ""interpretive"" menu labels that help put calorie counts into context do appear to impact the type and amount of food people ordered and consumed (6). Some examples of interpretive labelling that works: providing the recommended total daily calorie allowances for an average adult as well as calorie counts per item; using ""traffic light"" colours to highlight options containing high, moderate or low amounts of fat, sodium, sugar and/or calories; or pairing calorie counts with an estimate of the number of minutes or miles of walking necessary to “work off” the same number of calories. Sixty extra calories may not sound like much, but you may reconsider your options if the menu suggests you take an extra 20min walk to expend that energy! So, if you’re trying to cut calories or make healthier diet choices, look for interpretive menu labels as a helpful way to identify and opt for healthier foods. Looking for other ways to avoid eating too much? Size does matter!People who are offered food and beverages in larger quantities tend to consume more than if they are served smaller amounts(7). Ordering smaller portions and having foods served on small plates can help prevent overindulging. Dining out can be part of a balanced lifestyle. Choosing from among the menu’s healthier options and keeping portions to a reasonable size allows you to enjoy your restaurant meal without worrying about jeopardizing your health or weight.']"

Research evidence supports this old adage (1) and there are plenty of good options for staying physically active… but how can we best exercise our brains? One option for a cognitive “work out” is computerized cognitive training (CCT): various types of computer programs designed to strengthen overall cognition and improve memory, attention span and learning. With many options now available online, CCT is showing promise in helping to prevent cognitive decline in healthy older adults (2;3). That ledresearchers to investigatewhether CCT could benefit those who have already experienced cognitive decline (4).They include people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) who have noticeable problems with thinking, memory, language and decision making but are still able to function independently, and people with dementia whose cognitive impairments interfere with daily activities. Study groups participated in supervised computerized cognitive skills training, video games or virtual reality activities for at least four hours in total, after which their cognitive abilities were measured and compared tocontrol groupswho didn’t take part in CCT or did different types of training. Cognitive “brain games” may be screen time well spent! People with MCI experienced moderate improvement in their overall cognitive abilities after taking part in computerized cognitive training sessions, specifically in areas such as memory, attention, verbal and non-verbal learning, and psychosocial functioning (4). For people with dementia, the evidence was less encouraging but some minor improvements were noted. Cognition tests were taken immediately after the completion of training, so the results don’t tell us much about the longer term impacts of CCT. More research is needed to address those and other questions, including whether CCT can help prevent the progression of mild cognitive impairment to full dementia. Although these results are promising, computer “brain games” should not be considered a one-step solution to keep our brains healthy and sharp. Research evidence shows that people with cognitive impairment, and their caregivers, benefit most when support programs have multiple components, including physical exercise and social interaction (5), andmost of us can benefit from less sedentary screen time! However, this research suggests that computer-based cognitive training can be considered one promising addition to treatment for people with cognitive impairment.']"

Yoga continues to attract more and more followers every year representing all ages and physical fitness levels. What’s the attraction? Although yoga originally evolved as a spiritual practice, it has become a popular means of promoting physical and mental well-being. The poses, stretches, breathing and relaxation/meditation techniques associated with yoga are credited with maintaining good health and improving health conditions that tend to affect us as we age. Here are three examples of the health benefits of yoga, based on recent research evidence. Click the links to read more about the related studies. 1. Relieve your aching back Chronic low back pain is a very common and disabling condition. Drugs help, but come with risks of side effects.Yoga may help relieve the pain. Studies show it can be an effective, safe, non-drug therapy either by itself, or used in combination with medication (1). 2. Boost your balance Our balance tends to diminish with age. It’s important to work at maintaining it because balance is key to preventing falls and falls-related injuries. Yoga – which involves controlled movements, concentration and holding various poses –can improve balance and mobilityin people who practice regularly (2). 3. Ease symptoms of disease The combination of physical exercise (poses and stretches), mindful breathing and relaxation/meditation aim to strengthen and improve the body, mind and soul. Studies show that this holistic approach to health and wellness can help improve health-related quality of life and mental well-being in older adults, as well as relieve symptoms in people recovering from or coping with diseases\xa0such ascancer,asthmaandtype 2 diabetes(3-6). Yoga your way There are many types of yoga, including classes for beginners or those with physical limitations. Most poses can be adapted… or you can simply choose not to do some of them. Yoga may be practiced by millions of people around the world but how, where and at what level is uniquely personal. If you haven’t already done so, consider giving it a try. You have nothing to lose – except possibly some pain and stiffness – and much to potentially gain including pain relief, balance and overall quality of life.']"

We know that time is of the essence when it comes togetting to the hospital for treatment. But for many people, recovery from the initial event is just the beginning of a longer period of recovery and rehabilitation to restore lost function caused by the stroke. For at least\xa0one third of all people who suffer a stroke, recovery includes problems with communication (1). “Aphasia” is the term for language difficulties – including trouble speaking, listening and understanding, reading and writing – that often result from a stroke. Some or all communication skills may be affected and to varying degrees (2). For patients and their loved ones, it can add another layer of frustration and anxiety to an already difficult situation. Fortunately, most people recover language and communication skills, though the rate at which they regain abilities – and whether they make a full recovery – varies depending on the individual. For some, it’s a slow and uncertain climb and anything that might help the process is welcome. Speech language therapy is a recommended option. “If any stroke patient is showing signs of aphasia, speech language therapy should be included in their recovery plan according to theCanadian Stroke Best Practices,” says Dr. Patrice Lindsay, Director of Stroke,Heart & Stroke. “If not treated properly, aphasia can have a negative impact on a patient’s overall recovery, for example, they may become socially isolated. This may affect their desire and ability to actively participate in the rehabilitation process.” But what does the research say about speech language therapy. Does it really work? One recentsystematic reviewexamined the results of 57 randomized controlled trials involving more than 3,000 people with aphasia (3). In about half of the studies, participants who were offered speech language therapy were compared withcontrol groupswho received no specialized or formal language assistance. Other studies compared speech language therapy with social support or stimulation (i.e. opportunities to practice communication skills but not in a structured, standardized way) or compared different types and intensities of speech language therapy. Research evidence shows that speech language therapy is an effective way to improve language and communication skills after a stroke (3). It’s clearly better than no therapy at all but comparisons to other approaches like social support and stimulation were hard to make since many study participants withdrew early from the less structured programs. The evidence also suggested that “higher intensity” speech language therapy, for example more sessions and/or for a longer duration, can contribute to greater and/or faster improvements. While speech language therapy is a valuable part of stroke recovery, some people may not have easy access to Speech Language Pathologists, particularly outside urban areas and – depending on where you live and your healthcare plan – costs may not be covered. Be proactive about your stroke recovery plan: find out if speech language therapy is available to you and options for financial assistance. Stroke recovery involves patience, perseverance and understanding on the part of the person affected as well as family and friends. In the meantime, it’s important to keep those lines of communication open, even if aphasia makes it more challenging.']"

But there’s a downside to all that pill popping. Hazards range from minor side effects to serious and even deadly consequences, most notably whencertain kinds of drugs are used to manage chronic pain. The tide is beginning to turn as more healthcare professionals advocate for medication reviews, deprescribing and the use of “alternative” or non-drug therapies for managing pain. Even when medical treatments or prescription drugs are vital for recovery, people can still benefit from alternative therapies with proven benefits, which can be used to complement and enhance treatments. Here are five that have been tested by researchers. Click on the links for details about the studies. 1.\xa0 Get your groove on There’s a reason why music is such a major part of life for most people: it can entertain, inspire, cheer, soothe, motivate and relax. But can it relieve pain? According to research evidence, listening to certain kinds of music before, during and/or after surgeryhelps reduce pain, anxiety and depression(1). 2.\xa0 Get a move on Like it or not, if we want to stay healthy and mobile into our senior years we need to make exercise a part of our daily routine. It’s hard to stay motivated and active though, especially when something (back, knees, hips, old football injury) is acting up again. But don’t give up: research shows exercise can be one of the best ways to relieveback painorknee painas well as build strength and stamina (2-5). 3.\xa0 Try acupuncture Acupuncture, long used in Chinese medicine, is now popular and widely practiced in North America to improve health and well being. Thin needles inserted into the body at specific points help to reduce pain and improve bodily functions. For example, research shows that acupuncture canreduce the frequency of headaches and migraines(6-9).\xa0It may alsoreduce short-term painin people with knee osteoarthritis, while improving physical functioning in the short- and long-term (9;10). 4.\xa0 Change your mindset Cognitive-behavioural therapy is a short-term, goal-oriented type of psychotherapy that helps people develop personalized coping skills and change harmful thoughts or beliefs. It’s often used totreat depressionand other mental health problems (11), but it may also help relieve pain – particularly pain that isn’t due to a specific disease or condition. For example, studies show that cognitive-behavioural therapy helpsreduce the frequency and intensity of chest pain(12). 5.\xa0 Breathe and relax Relaxation techniques and activities like yoga – including stretching, breathing and meditation – promote health and wellness by calming the mind, reducing stress and lowering blood pressure. What’s the evidence on pain relief? Research showsyoga helps ease pain and disability associated with low back pain(13). Thinking outside the (pill) box No one wants to be in pain and if there’s a pill that can make it disappear, most people will find it hard to resist. But drugs don’t always help everyone and if they do, short-term pain relief could come at the expense of potentially serious side effects and longer-term health problems. Non-drug strategies are worth trying as a safer first line of defense.']"
254,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2017/06/13/digestive-problems-try-probiotics,13 June 2017,Digestive problems? Try probiotics,"[""Probiotics: They’re being added to more food items and touted as solving a wide range of health problems, boosting body functions from your brain to your breathing to your bowels. But is this just another fad? What are probiotics anyway? And do they live up to all the hype? Probiotics are actually bacteria – the “good” kind. Our bodies have trillions of these microorganisms, some harmful but the majority of them beneficial. “Good” bacteria help break down food and keep the “bad” bacteria at bay. Probiotic bacteria are found in cultured dairy foods like yogurt, fermented vegetables like kimchi and sauerkraut, and foods fortified with probiotic bacterial cultures. They’re also available in capsules. So they’re easy to find and consume… but are they really the “miracle cure” many claim them to be? Although there is some indication from the research evidence that probiotics may help to treat many common health issues (includingrespiratory infections(1) andpneumonia(2)), so far, we can only\xa0say with confidence that probiotics are beneficial for improved digestive health. Medications (especially antibiotics), stress, diet and other factors can alter the ratio of good to bad bacteria in your gut, causing infection and disease. This happens more often than you might think: antibiotics are one of the most prescribed medications in Canada and the US (and often prescribed unnecessarily… but that’s another story) (3;4). They’re important and effective in killing infection-causing bacteria, but they often end up killing a lot of good bacteria, upsetting that important balance and giving dangerousClostridium difficilebacteria a chance to cause severe diarrhea and other bowel diseases, sometimes with fatal results (5). That’s where probiotics – likeLactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus caseiandBifidobacterium lactis– come in. Research evidence shows that probiotics given to children and adults taking antibiotics successfully lowers the risk ofC. difficile-associated diarrhea (6;7). Thanks to results from these and other studies, probiotics are now recommended and commonly prescribed for people who are taking antibiotics, particularly as they are relatively inexpensive and safe for most people (6). There is also promising evidence that probiotics may also help in the treatment of other common gastrointestinal problems, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic constipation (8), conditions that affect more than 10% of the adult population (9;10). As we continue to learn more about the role probiotics play in promoting health, go ahead and enjoy your yogurt, especially if you are prescribed antibiotics. Consuming more probiotic-rich food isn't likely to cause harm, and very well may help keep your gut balanced and happy! As for the other health benefits of probiotics? Time – and evidence from ongoing research – will tell.""]"

It’s also about being proactive: going for check-ups, taking part in screening programs that can detect certain diseases in the early stages and learning how to prevent or better manage chronic conditions. These actions can help save lives and prevent more invasive medical procedures (1;2). But what if you don’t know about such programs, have no way to get to them, are confused about their purpose or don’t understand what you’re being told? That’s the case for many people, including those in underserved communities who don’t access these vital health programs due to location, language and/or other barriers (3). Being sensitive to cultural values, beliefs and concerns is a starting point to help reduce unequal access to health information and programs. But what specific actions can we take? Asystematic reviewon cancer screening measured whether culturally adapted health education helps to improve cancer screening rates (4). Participants were included in peer-led information sessions about cancer screening and given culturally customized materials (pamphlets, brochures, videos, etc.), individualized reminders and guidance, and – in some cases – free materials or reimbursement of costs related to screening. Communication and training that reflects an individual’s language and culture improves people’s ability and motivation to respond to health promotion programs (4;5). Culturally adapted materials resulted in higher cancer screening participation rates (4). We often feel more comfortable and receptive when we can relate to the person giving advice, and this review found that programs were particularly successful when delivered by “peer providers” with the same ethnic background or similar cultural values (4;5). Many of the included studies found that these targeted approaches also helped improve people’s knowledge, awareness and attitudes about screening, suggesting they are more likely to continue participating in the programs in the future. And this is just one example. Culturally customized health education can have benefits beyond cancer screening.A secondsystematic reviewfound that culturally adapted training for diabetes self-care improves symptoms and helps people cope better with the disease (6). While athird reviewfound that culturally tailoring programs/treatment approaches/strategies may have the potential to enhance satisfaction with the care received and improve health outcomes in ethnic minorities with a chronic illness (7). Translation of information and interpretation by peers helps to ensure health messages are meaningfully understood… but we know it takes more than this. Dr. Esha Ray Chaudhuri, a social scientist and member of\xa0McMaster Optimal Aging Portal\'s Citizen Advisory Council, points out that a message is only useful if people “actually relate to its value,” and are able to put the advice into practice. For example, translated materials can help people understand the importance of cancer screening or improving their diet. But if these recommendations differ from their personal or cultural values, or they are dependent on a family member or public transportation to take them to appointments or shopping, they may not be able to actually do these things. Dr. Ray Chaudhuri also cautions that some approaches could back-fire “if based on a limited understanding of a different culture.” Making assumptions about the needs and uniformity of cultural communities could actually turn people off and impede the success of health programs, she says. One way to ensure that healthy aging education, programs and services fit your needs is to get involved: advocate for activities and approaches that work for you! Dr. Ray Chaudhuri encourages all of us to recognize and share our individual needs and preferences as a “whole” person – including language and cultural/personal values – as a way to help more people access and follow through on recommendations to improve health. Speak up at appointments with your health providers and contact your local health centre to find out how you can get involved. Cultural attitudes and values are central to how people view their own health and wellbeing. Incorporating these values into health communication and promotion strategies can help ensure that no one ""falls through the cracks"" when it comes to preventing or managing serious diseases.']"

Furthermore, older adults who fall once are more likely to fall again (2). Those are startling statistics and they represent a lot of injured people whose quality of life is also likely to take a nosedive. You don’t have to be one of them! Maybe you’ve already made some changes to your home environment such as installing handrails and grab bars, improving lighting and removing items that can be a tripping hazard. That’s wise, but don’t stop there. Research shows these three simple changes to your physical health can also help you stay steady on your feet. Click on the links for details about the research. 1.  Build your strength As we age our bodies often lose muscle mass and strength (a condition called sarcopenia) and the resulting weakness – particularly in the legs – is what makes us more likely to fall. But we can fight back by getting regular physical exercise that includes weight bearing activities to build and strengthen muscles. One approach supported by research evidence is“high intensity progressive resistance strength training""(3). It’s not as complicated as it sounds: simply start exercising with a weight that is difficult but doable and increase the weight as it becomes easier. Many different types of exercise are beneficial for building muscle mass, includingworking out in the pooland withelastic resistance bands(4;5). Remember: the best type of exercise is one that you enjoy, as you are more likely to stick with it and see the benefits. What’s more, exercise can also be combined with other falls prevention strategies—such as education or doing anenvironmental assessmentandremoving tripping hazards—to prevent falls (6-9). 2.  Find your balance A loss of balance is also common in older age, another reason seniors are at higher risk of falling. Once again, exercise is the remedy. Movements designed to improve balance and flexibility – includingPilatesand exercises using theNintendo Wii– can help us stand firm, or recover quickly if we begin to lose our footing (10-12).Tai chiis also recommended for its various benefits including improving strength and balance through slow controlled movements (13). 3.  Take stock of your pill cupboard With age comes wisdom… and often a lot more pills. Prescription and over-the-counter drugs serve a purpose, but side effects such as dizziness, disorientation and sleepiness couldcause people to stumble and fall(14). As well, seniors who take multiple medications are athigher risk of health complicationsfrom drug interactions. Amedication reviewwith your doctor or pharmacist helps to assess the benefits and risks of prescribed drugs and may result in some drugs being “deprescribed.” This means backing off when doses are too high or stopping medications that are no longer needed (15). 4. Consider seeing a podiatrist Be it issues with your shoes or feet, being mindful of your foot health is an important part of the falls prevention process.Podiatry care, specifically multicomponent care (e.g., podiatrist care with advice, information, exercises, and footwear and/or orthotics) and multifaceted care (e.g., risk assessment by a diverse team of professionals and a referral to a podiatrist) may reduce falls in older adults (16). Failure (to move) is not an option! Many older adults believe the best way to protect themselves from falling and getting hurt is by stopping some or all of their physical activities. That might seem like a safe and sensible solution but it’s flawed for a few reasons. The less you move and exercise, the weaker and more frail you become, whichincreasesyour risk of falling. And life can end up being pretty dull for people who don’t get out much. Instead, examine your exercise and other lifestyle routines and make some changes if necessary. It’s never too late – or too early – to work on making yourself more sure-footed and able to resist falls so you can get out and about with confidence.']"
257,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2017/05/17/got-heartburn-avoid-these-common-acid-blocking-drugs,17 May 2017,Got heartburn? Avoid these common acid-blocking drugs,"['Do you suffer from stomach (gastrointestinal) problems causing heartburn? It can be a huge relief to find treatment options that work. Perhaps you keep some over-the-counter tablets, pills or liquids on hand to help. Or maybe, like millions of North Americans, you’ve graduated to a stronger type of prescription drug known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). PPIs work by reducing the amount of acid produced in the stomach. For people with gastric ulcers or gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), PPIs’ acid-blocking abilities help ulcers to heal or prevent damage to the esophagus. They do the job (1), which is why they’ve increasingly been prescribed for more common gastrointestinal issues like heartburn. PPIs – for example, esomprazole (Nexium), omeprazole (Prilosec) and lansoprazole (Prevacid) – are one of the most commonly prescribed types of medication worldwide (2). But that trend may be over as more health professionals are taking steps to stop the overprescribing of PPIs, which has accounted for billions of dollars in drug costs (3). There has also been a lot of press on the possible harms of PPIs.\xa0There is evidence that people taking PPIs may be more likely to get GI infections (4) but other possible harms may turn out not to be true (5). Nevertheless these studies highlight that you can never be sure a drug is safe and it is important not to take drugs that you don’t really need. Awareness of the potential harms and overprescribing of PPIs has shifted the focus of research to find safe and effective ways to get people off this type of medication (6). Research evidence shows that many people are prescribed PPIs unnecessarily and at too high a dose (6). Awareness and education – giving people the facts about the risks associated with PPIs – is a first step to discontinue the drug. Tapering off (gradually reducing the medication) is recommended as a safe way to do so (6). This can help to avoid the uncomfortable “rebound” acid reflux that can happen when acid blocking drugs are withdrawn too quickly (7). Used appropriately, PPIs are beneficial in treating certain illnesses. But Health Canada advises they be prescribed at the lowest dose and the shortest duration necessary to treat the condition (8). What does it mean for people experiencing common – yet still distressing – episodes of heartburn? First, ask your doctor or pharmacist if your heartburn or ulcer medication is a PPI. If so, work together to decide whether or how to taper off this medication. Most patients can safely reduce or stop their PPI medications, the exception to this would be those that have a condition called Barrett’s esophagus and some patients that have a previous bleeding gastric or duodenal ulcer (or at high risk of having this). Safer solutions may include trying a few lifestyle changes (for example, changing your eating and drinking habits or sleep positions) supplemented when needed with over-the-counter antacid pills and tablets if necessary. Maybe they won’t be as quick a fix, but they do work (9) and what a relief to know you’re not putting yourself at risk of additional health problems.']"

However, very few of these studies are as impressive as they sound. It is a good idea to be cautious about trending health topics in the news. If you unknowingly base a health decision on a recommendation that has no scientific research to back it up, is based on very poorly conducted studies, or – even worse – disregards good quality studies suggesting their claims are wrong, you are unlikely to find that recommendation lives up to its hype. Unfounded health recommendations might even be harmful to your health. Learning to recognize credible advice supported by the best available research will help you make informed choices that are most likely to benefit you. Ask these six questions to critique the latest “miracle solution” you read about in the headlines. 1)What’s the source? Checking the trustworthiness of news sources and references behind the claims is a first step. Does the source have standards for measuring the credibility of the information or advice they share? Or are they more likely to report sensational headlines to boost their click or viewer numbers? Look for proof that any claims or recommendations are supported by study findings published in a credible academic journal. Always question\xa0celebrity claims, overly dramatic findings or miracle cures. 2)\xa0\xa0\xa0\xa0 What’s in it for them? Do the researchers, their funders or the groups sharing the information stand to benefit from the results?\xa0 You may be aware that celebrities and media programs often have sponsorships or behind-the-scenes partnerships that could bias their claims...\xa0well,\xa0this also applies to research. It is wise to be skeptical of studies supported or promoted\xa0by for-profit businesses that are trying to sell you something. 3)How many people were involved in the study? The more people involved in a study, the more power researchers have to make conclusions and generalize the results to a larger group. A study that shows Tai Chi improves balance in 7 out of 10 people sounds great, but with such a small group, it is hard to know whether these results are just a coincidence, or related to specific characteristics of the people involved. If 700 out of 1000 people show these same benefits, you can have more confidence that Tai Chi can help boost your balance. 4)Was there a control group? The highest quality studies randomly select participants to try the activity or treatment, and compare results to a group that do not participate. This way, they can tease out the benefits of the activity, controlling for other influences. For example, did a walking group programactuallyencourage participants to walk more, or did a seasonal change from winter to spring during the study period encourage more people to be active outdoors? 5)How long did the study last? Short-term measurements of treatment benefits are useful. However, studies that use accurate and reliable ways to measure effects more than once and over a longer period (say, 6 months or a year later) provide more information about long-term benefits as well as any potential long-term side effects or harms. 6)Will it work for me? Consider your own personal needs, preferences and circumstances when making health decisions. For example, research shows compression bandages applied by a home health care provider are the most effective treatment for foot ulcers. However, many people do not like wearing these bandages and so do not use them as prescribed. In some cases, it may be best to choose a less effective treatment option, but one that you will actually put into practice. If in doubt... check with us!

The phrase might sound a bit old fashioned but that’s basically what’s happening: physical changes – specifically the decrease in estrogen – trigger the hot flashes, night sweats, moodiness, irritability and other complaints commonly associated with the transition (1). Other symptoms are more “delicate” in nature. Genitourinary syndrome of menopause refers to problems with the genital system (e.g. vaginal dryness, itching, burning, soreness, painful intercourse) or the lower urinary tract (infection, increased frequency of urination or urinary incontinence) (2). But while the hot flashes and other symptoms usually subside once “the change” is complete, genital and urinary symptoms can persist and rarely go away without treatment (3). It’s a widespread and distressing problem affecting around half of all postmenopausal women (4) with the most commonly reported symptoms being vaginal dryness and itching/irritation (5). And yet, it’s a significantly underreported and undertreated condition; only a quarter to half of women experiencing symptoms seek medical attention (4;6). That’s unfortunate, because effective treatments are available in the form of vaginal estrogens: creams, gels, tablets or rings containing low doses of estrogen are applied to the vaginal area. They’ve been proven effective for vaginal symptoms (7) yet many women seem hesitant to start or continue using them (4;6). That prompted the Society of Gynecologic Surgeons (SGS) to conduct anewsystematic reviewof the effectiveness and safety of vaginal estrogens with the ultimate goal of helping doctors and patients make informed treatment choices (8). The review included 44 studies of varying durations that compared different types of vaginal estrogen to no treatment, aplacebo, non-hormonal moisturizers or lubricants, or systemic estrogen (pills or skin patches that release hormones into the blood). For certain single symptoms – such vaginal dryness – over the counter lubricants and moisturizers may bring adequate relief. But for multiple or more severe symptoms, vaginal estrogens are recommended as the next step. The evidence shows all types of vaginal estrogen effectively\xa0relieve symptoms of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (8). There was also some evidence that vaginal estrogens help reduce the frequency of urinary tract infection. Although vaginal estrogens are considered generally safe and contain low doses of the hormone (little of which is released in the bloodstream), more research is needed to measure longer-term effects (8). Menopause may be associated with decreased estrogen but it doesn’t have to mean a diminished quality of life. A consultation with the doctor and a prescription for vaginal estrogen may relieve those uncomfortable symptoms and result in a change for the better.']"

Many people take unnecessary meds,"['How many pills do you take every day? If you’re over the age of 65, chances are you’re regularly taking at least five and possibly upwards of 10 different prescription drugs (1, 2). As people get older and suffer more age-related health problems, they’re likely to continue adding to that collection of pill bottles on their night stand or pill shelf (1). Those medications were likely prescribed for good reason, but over time some drugs may no longer be helpful, and in fact can even cause harm. For example, some medications can trigger bad reactions when combined with others or may cause side effects such as fuzzy thinking, weakness, falls, disability and even death (3, 4). That’s why “polypharmacy,” the use of multiple drugs at the same time, is recognized as a serious threat to quality of life and healthy aging. What can we do about it? A promising strategy is a multi-step process that begins with a review of your medications. A doctor or pharmacist can help assess the benefits and risks of each one and “deprescribe” any that are no longer appropriate (5). Deprescribing means backing off when doses are too high, or stopping medications that are no longer needed. Considerable research has been conducted to find out if deprescribing is a safe approach and whether it helps to improve health and longevity. In a recentsystematic reviewincluding more than 34,000 older adults, researchers measured the benefits and risks of deprescribing (6). All study participants had a medication review and at least one of their prescribed medications withdrawn. Researchers measured impacts on mortality (risk of death) and whether deprescribing had other impacts such as drug withdrawal or risk of falls. Medication review and deprescribing appear to be reasonable and safe ways to address polypharmacy in seniors. Review results suggest stopping one or more unnecessary medications can lead to health benefits such as fewer falls and may even increase your chance of living a longer life (6). Encouragingly, stopping unnecessary medications did not increase risk of drug withdrawal or affect quality of life. Reviewing medications – and deprescribing when warranted – has strong and growing support among doctors, geriatricians, pharmacists and other healthcare professionals concerned with the over prescribing and overuse of drugs. In Canada, the goals of theCanadian Deprescribing Networkare to reduce prescriptions of inappropriate medications by 50%\xa0by 2020 and to promote safer drug and non-drug therapies. Wonder if you’d be better off with fewer pills? Start by asking your doctor or pharmacist for a medication review. Together, you can work on a plan to meet your health and wellness goals and safely reduce drugs you no longer need.']"

Assuming you haven’t overindulged in alcohol (a completely different issue) you probably have some type of vestibular (inner ear) problem causing vertigo. Vertigo can be the result of various disorders – including benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis or Ménière’s disease (1) – but it’s generally the presence of something (e.g. particles, fluid, infection) in the inner ear canal that affects your sense of gravity and causes the dizziness, vision issues and other odd sensations (2). Often, only one side of your head is affected (unilateral). The symptoms may come and go and can last minutes to hours… or sometimes much longer. Besides the physical unpleasantness, vertigo can also affect quality of life since many people stop doing their regular activities and going out for fear of falling or getting hurt (2,3). So how do you get off the crazy ride? \xa0“Vestibular rehabilitation” is the term for exercises and movements that ease the symptoms (4) by helping your brain adjust to what’s happening inside the ear (habituation), controlling eye movements so that your vision isn’t affected by head motion (gaze stabilization) and improving steadiness (balance training). Several studies have tested the effectiveness of vestibular rehabilitation exercises including 39 good qualityrandomized controlled trialsthat were part of asystematic review(1). Under the direction of experts, more than 2,400 participants – all with vertigo – performed combinations of exercises and were compared to those who received “sham” or other types of treatment. Inanother reviewof 11 studies with 745 participants, researchers measured the effectiveness of “repositioning manoeuvers” for people with BPPV (5). These manoeuvers are aimed at moving particles in the ear canal to another part of the ear where they won’t cause problems. There was moderate to strong evidence that vestibular rehabilitation helps reduce dizziness and disorientation and improves vision issues, balance and mobility (1). The exercises are safe and simple and some may be done at home, but it’s recommended you first see a doctor or therapist to determine the best treatment plan for your condition. There is also evidence that repositioning manoeuvers like the Epley manoeuver – in which a medical professional guides the patient through a series of sitting and reclining positions – can effectively treat symptoms safely (5). The benefits of both types of approaches are short-term and many people with vertigo will experience more than one episode (1,5). A combination of both vestibular rehabilitation and physical maneuvers may help provide longer-term benefits (1). Vertigo is common – even turning your head quickly can bring it on for some people. But if it persists or is interfering with your activities, find out if a few simple moves can get you feeling back on solid ground and in control.']"

From occasional bouts of restlessness to chronic insomnia, sleep problems can affect anyone at any age but they’re particularly common – and difficult to resolve – in people with dementia (1, 2). Why is that? As with many aspects of dementia, we don’t yet know. Sleep problems may be related to changes in the brain that affect the “circadian rhythm” or body clock (3). As a result, people with dementia often have trouble falling or staying asleep at night, wake early or frequently, and often wander at night, risking falls and other injuries. Wakeful nights are usually followed by excessive sleepiness during the day (3). It’s a distressing problem that can affect the quality of life of people with dementia as well as their caregivers. While prescription sleeping pills and over-the-counter sleep aids can help people with sleep problems, it’s not clear whether they work the same way in people with dementia. There are also concerns about harmful side effects (4). The authors of a recentsystematic reviewhoped to learn more about which medications work best to help people with Alzheimer’s disease and sleep disturbances (3). Participants were given commonly prescribed sleep medications. Their sleep quantity and quality was measured using activity sensors and compared with people incontrol groups, who received aplacebo. Unfortunately, there does not seem to be an easy sleep solution. Three common medications were included in the studies, including the hormone melatonin (four trials), the antidepressant trazodone (one trial) and the sedative ramelteon (one trial). None of these medications significantly helped to improve sleep in people with dementia (3). Although it is not as helpful to find out whatdoesn’twork – especially for people desperate for a good night’s sleep – these findings can help people with dementia and their caregivers avoid taking an unnecessary medication. Besides the three drugs included in this review, we don’t yet know enough about the benefits and risks ofothercommon sleep medications to recommend them… yet many people are prescribed these drugs anyway. Until we know more, safer non-drug approaches to encourage sleep are worth a try. Some ideas include: establishing consistent daily routines (e.g. wake times, meal times, bedtimes); regular exercise; restricting naptime during the day; and ensuring a comfortable, temperature controlled and soothing environment for sleeping (5). Light therapy - exposing people to minimum amounts of bright light during the day -\xa0might also help reset circadian rhythms and improve nighttime sleeping (6). It may take some trial and error to find the right strategy. Ideally, a safe and effective plan can be put in place that allows everyone to rest easy.']"

Try text message reminders,"['People of all ages have embraced text messaging as an easy, efficient way to communicate. Even many adults who originally thought they’d never get the hang of thumbing messages on tiny little keyboards, are now effortlessly texting as part of their daily routine. This comfort with cell phones and technology can also come in handy when it comes to managing medications. Many of us have trouble keeping track of our meds, sometimes forgetting to take them regularly or as prescribed. As many as half of people with serious chronic conditions begin skipping doses – or stop taking the pills altogether – within a year of starting them (1, 2). That’s worrisome: it can result in complications, hospitalization, even more debilitating illness and premature death (3). It’s also expensive: “medication non-adherence” in North America is estimated to cost billions of dollars each year for additional doctor visits and treatments (4). A possible solution may be to try cell phone text messages as a way to remind and encourage people to take their medication. That idea prompted asystematic reviewof 16randomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 2,700 participants aged 31 to 64 who had at least one chronic condition (e.g. HIV, heart disease, diabetes and epilepsy) (5). People in the study groups received text messages on their cell phones reminding them to take their medications, sometimes accompanied by motivational or humorous messages. Their “adherence” scores were compared with those incontrol groups, who did not receive text messages. (Text) message received loud and clear! According to the review studies – 10 of which were of high quality – people were significantly more likely to take their medications as directed when prompted via their cell phones. Further research is needed to determine the best frequency, timing and content of the messages. More research is also needed to determine if text reminders are effective in the long term (more than 12 months). There are several advantages to using cell phones to promote better health: messages are received instantly; it’s a well-used and trusted technology; it’s a relatively low cost and low maintenance approach; and cell phones (they don’t need to be “smart” phones) have become much more affordable for many people. Text message reminders may not be the perfect solution to what is a major health concern, and their use may not be appropriate for everyone. But if this approach can benefit a majority of chronic disease sufferers and help ease pressure on healthcare systems, it’s an option worth pursuing.']"

The benefits of progressive resistance training,"['You know exercise is important to your long-term health and well-being, and you probably know your routine should include some weight or strength training… but do you know why? In a nutshell: weight training strengthens muscles so they can support you through all your activities, throughout your lifespan. If you don’t build and maintain your muscles, there’s a good chance that at some point they’ll let you down – literally. Weight bearing exercise is the first line of defense against the loss of muscle mass that occurs with age. Building strength can help you avoid falls and reduce the risk of losing your mobility, independence and quality of life (1). One approach recommended for older adults is “high intensity progressive resistance strength training.”\xa0That may sound\xa0intimidating but it really isn’t. It simply means gradually increasing the weight or resistance in order to challenge – and strengthen – muscles (2). You start with a weight that is difficult but doable and increase the weight as it becomes easier. Progressive resistance strength training can be a safe and effective way for older adults to strengthen leg muscles, which is essential to avoiding falls and remaining active (3). Onesystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 21 studies to find out how high intensity progressive strength training compares to training at less intense levels (3). The studies focused on lower leg training, with workouts lasting from 45 to 90 minutes two to three times per week (participants were all aged 60 or above). Training programs lasted from eight to 52 weeks. Progressive resistance strength training performed at high intensity appears to be the most efficient way to strengthen leg muscles according to the review results. Training at a moderate intensity, but for a longer period of time (e.g. more “reps”) may also help improve flexibility and function (3). High intensity progressive resistance strength training has also been found to be one of the best ways to improve gait – or walking – speed in older adults (4). That’s good to know as a slow walking pace is associated with a greater risk of falls, injuries and hospitalization (5). Improving your walking speed may mean a longer life and better health (6). You may not be a body builder or a professional athlete seeking a trophy or gold medal. But that doesn’t mean you don’t need to keep your muscles strong. Staying strong is important for everyone and scores an even more important prize: a better chance of enjoying a long, healthy and vigorous life.']"

Aquatic exercise – including swimming, water-based resistance training or water aerobics – is popular among people who want a low impact workout. For older adults it’s can be a great option to stay active… not to mention, it looks like fun! But how does a water workout compare to land-based exercise? Arecent well-donesystematic reviewmeasured the fitness level of participants who took part in different types of aquatic exercise programs compared to those who didn’t exercise at all, or who did land-based exercises (1). The participants (89% women), were all 50 years or older, were generally healthy but not exercising regularly before taking part in the research. They took aquatic classes one to five times a week doing a mixture of endurance and flexibility exercises for both the upper and lower body. Looks like all those “aquafit” fans are on to something: research evidence suggests that moderate to high intensity aquatic exercise is at least as effective as land-based exercise for \xa0improving strength, endurance, flexibility and physical function (1). Another review also found modest evidence that aquatic exercise helps relieve pain, stiffness and other symptoms of osteoarthritis (2, 3). Exercise is important for everyone and is a key to healthy aging, including preventing or slowing the progression of chronic conditions (4). The best type of exercise is one that you enjoy, as you are more likely to stick with it. So if you are someone who enjoys a splash in the pool,\xa0why not give aquatic exercise a try? You don’t need to be a strong swimmer; in fact you don’t need to know how to swim at all.

267,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2017/01/23/a-closer-look-at-opioids-for-chronic-pain,23 January 2017,A closer look at opioids for chronic pain,"['Many people who suffer from chronic pain often seek more than an over the counter medication to help them make it through the day. Opioid-based drugs – such as morphine, methadone, fentanyl, oxycodone (OxyContin®) and hydrocodone (Vicodin®) among others – \xa0are commonly prescribed in North America to help ease the burden of chronic pain (1). But what to do when pain relief from these ‘heavy hitters’ comes with a risk of serious consequences? Chronic pain, defined as pain that lasts more than three months or past the normal time for healing, is common. Chronic pain that isn’t related to cancer affects about 20% of Canadian adults (2;3). Older adults are particularly vulnerable as they are more likely to have conditions that contribute to chronic pain such as osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and low back pain (4). Ironically, it was partly due to concerns about the potential dangers of “NSAIDS,” commonly used anti-inflammatory pills including aspirin and ibuprofen, that doctors began prescribing opioids (5). For the past few decades their use has increased dramatically in North America. For example, from 1999 to 2010, the amount of prescription opioids sold in the U.S. nearly quadrupled (6). So how has that worked out? As we’ve witnessed, it has sparked a drug epidemic and a public health crisis due to drug dependency, addiction and overdose. Between 1999 and 2008, deaths due to opioid drug overdose in the U.S. – nearly half a million – also quadrupled (6). In Canada, a “tidal wave” of fentanyl overdoses has spread across the country, accounting for 30% of opioid related deaths in Ontario, according to Chief Coroner Dirk Huyer (7). It is important to acknowledge the contribution of illicit (non-prescription) opioids to this epidemic, as well as issues related to prescribed opioids getting into the hands of others… typically for non-medical use. This connection between increased prescribing of opioids and the number of opioid-related deaths is no coincidence, as research has shown. Thirty-nine studies were part of asystematic reviewaimed at informing the effectiveness and risks of long-term opioid use for relieving chronic pain (8). The review authors found norandomized controlled trialsthat measured the benefits and/or harms of opioid use for a year or more. While this review highlights the urgent need for more research on longer term use,as clinical reviewers have noted(8), the review serves as a “wake up call” and provides more data to dissuade us from prescribing narcotics for chronic pain. Meanwhile, there is increasing evidence that opioids, on average, provide very limited relief of chronic pain (9;10), with no increased benefit at higher doses (8;11). Many experts concur, suggesting that the tendency to increase dosages as patients remain sensitive to pain but more tolerant of the drug, can increase risks of addiction and overdose (11;12). So, if NSAIDs and opioids are associated with limited benefits and significant harms when used for managing chronic pain, what do we do? So far, a safe and effective cure for chronic pain has been frustratingly elusive and the focus of treatment is shifting to managing pain vs getting rid of it. For now, doctors are urged to prescribe opioids only as a last resort and to restrict daily doses to ≤90 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) except in exceptional circumstances (13;14). If you are living with chronic pain, try a low dose tricyclic antidepressant (e.g. Amitriptyline) (15) or non-drug therapies such as exercise, acupuncture, or mindfulness training (16-19). If your doctor has prescribed opioids for your pain, start with the lowest possible dose. Keep in mind that physical dependence will develop in anybody taking opioids long-term, and symptoms of opioid withdrawal may prevent some people from reducing their opioid dose to meet the ≤90MME threshold. Talk to your doctor about this possibility and strategies to manage your pain while reducing your dose (20). There are programs and tools available to help monitor and manage opioid prescriptions. For example, theCDC Opioid Guideline Mobile app,Checklist for prescribing opioids for chronic pain, or theMcMaster’s DeGroot Pain Centre’s “Opioid Manager”,also available as an app. Chronic pain is an important and challenging issue, but it’s imperative that any management options provide benefits that outweigh their risks.']"

There are so many reasons to live smoke free – most of them related to your health, longevity and quality of life. But for many people the physical addiction to nicotine is incredibly difficult to battle. Nonetheless, that doesn’t mean you should quit trying to quit smoking. It is never too late to reap the benefits, some of which occur within days of quitting (1). Here are five evidence-based strategies for becoming – and staying – smoke-free. Click the links in the reference list to read summaries of the research findings. 1.  Smart use of that smartphone Why not use your phone to help smooth your road to smoke-free living? Asystematic reviewof 12 studies showed that support programs delivered via mobile phone can help you quit smoking and stay on the wagon (2). Most of the studies involved texts sent to participants’ smartphones with information, advice and motivational messages. Can programmes delivered by mobile phones help people to stop smoking(2)? Motivational text messages also worked to help people quit smoking in a previous review (3). Text-messaging helps people quit smoking(3). 2.  Seek out support Quitting is hard and there is no shame in seeking personal support – in fact, this can increase your chances of quitting successfully. Two high quality systematic reviews show that ‘behavioural support’ such as talking to medical professionals, one-on-one or group counseling, and receiving customized resource materials can encourage people to quit smoking. The more regular and intense the support, the more likely participants were to still be non-smokers six months after quitting\xa0(4;5). Behavioural support and pharmacotherapy improve smoking quit rates in adults(4). Does a combination of stop smoking medication and behavioural support help smokers to stop(5)? Telephone quit lines – especially those with call-back counselling – may also provide the support you need to quit (6). Is telephone counselling effective as part of a programme to help people stop smoking(6)? 3.  Try nicotine replacement options Nicotine is a powerful addiction and there are medication which can help you overcome it. Two systematic reviews measured nicotine replacement therapy (including nicotine patch or gum) and other drugs such as bupropion (e.g. Wellbutrin®, Zyban®) to help people quit smoking (4;5). Compared to thecontrol group(who received minimal support only) participants taking nicotine replacements were more likely to quit successfully.\xa0In fact, all licensed\xa0forms of NRT, from patches to sprays to tablets, can help increase the chances of quitting in people who make a quit attempt (7). Behavioural support and pharmacotherapy improve smoking quit rates in adults(4). Does a combination of stop smoking medication and behavioural support help smokers to stop(5)? Can smokers be helped to reduce the harm caused by cigarette smoking by smoking fewer cigarettes or using different tobacco products(8)?Different doses, durations and modes of delivery of nicotine replacement therapy for smoking cessation(9). This approach is not for everyone: side effects of some drugs include increased risk of heart problems. Consult your doctor to find out if this type of strategy is right for you. 4.  If one strategy is good, two or more is better! Research supports a “multi-modal” approach: using more than one strategy to help you quit smoking. Ideally, each strategy addresses a specific challenge (nicotine withdrawal, stress and anxiety, boredom etc.) so that you are better able to resist the temptation to light up. For example, research shows that people who take nicotine replacement drugs while getting supportive counseling are more successful at staying smoke free than those who tried just one of the two strategies. What is the best way to help people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease stop smoking(10)? Behavioural support and pharmacotherapy improve smoking quit rates in adults(4). Does a combination of stop smoking medication and behavioural support help smokers to stop(5)? 5.  Feel encouraged: Older smokers can quit (successfully) too! Do older adults – who may have smoked for many years – have a harder time trying to quit? Are some strategies more effective than others for older adults? Asystematic reviewof 29randomized controlled trialshas ignited what will likely be more research into smoking cessation programs for this population (11). So far the good news is that not only do seniors respond to drug and behavioural therapies, they have a slightly higher success rate than younger groups (12). Financial incentives (such as vouchers or cash) do seem to encourage people to quit, but are unlikely to last after the incentive is removed and unlikely to help you break the habit for good. Financial incentives can help motivate people to make lifestyle changes(13). E-cigarettes show some promise of helping people quit smoking in the long term – their effectiveness may be similar to nicotine patches – but so far our confidence in this approach is not strong and the long-term safety of e-cigarettes isn’t yet known. More research is needed before recommending e-cigarettes as a way to quit smoking. Electronic cigarettes for smoking cessation(14). If you still haven’t ‘kicked the habit,’ try some or all of the five tips listed above, or try something else. Everyone is different and there is no simple solution to nicotine addiction.

You’re treated, given medication and care instructions and prepped to go home. Now that you’re out of immediate danger and the initial shock has worn off you call it a “wake up call” and are grateful for a new lease on life. Yet, as many as 25% of patients treated and released from the hospital after heart failure are readmitted within 30 days (1). What does it take to help those at risk of repeat heart failure avoid being a frequent visitor to the ER? Having access to the right type of post-treatment care and support is key. “Transitional care” is designed to help ensure people continue to get the medical care and attention they need after the transition from hospital to home (2, 3). This can include support by a coordinated health care team providing education about self-care, monitoring the patient’s progress and symptoms and offering support to help manage medications (4). Transitional care can be provided through home visits, in a dedicated heart failure clinic, or remotely by telephone, video or internet. But does this type of care really help keep people out of the hospital after heart failure? If so, which approaches are most effective? That’s what asystematic reviewof 47randomized controlled trialssought to find out (4). The transitional care approaches included: home visiting programs (e.g. follow-up home care delivered by health professionals); structured telephone support; telemonitoring of heart rate, blood pressure and other measures; scheduled visits to heart failure clinics; and patient/caregiver education. Readmission to hospital and rates of death among heart failure patients receiving transitional care were compared to those receiving standard care only. Both home visiting programs and heart failure clinics help lower the chance of being readmitted to hospital and lower the chance of dying within six months after heart failure. Patient monitoring, education and self-management through telephone support helped lower the chance of another heart failure event (4). What do you do if you don’t have access to specialty clinics or services? Telephone monitoring and support is adaptable to people in different living situations and locations. Another recommended strategy is to include – and measure the success of – transitional care approaches in primary care settings (4). This could include efforts to ensure patients have increased access to primary care clinics with staff who are equipped with the knowledge and skills to provide targeted support after heart failure. The review reinforces the fact that effective follow-up medical care can have an important role in healing and recovery after heart failure, helping patients enjoy that “new lease on life” for a good long time!']"

Erectile dysfunction – or impotence as it used to be called – is indeed a very common condition that can affect men at any age but particularly as they get older (1). In fact, erectile dysfunction is an issue for about 50% of all men aged 40 to 70 (2) with potentially damaging impacts on their emotional well-being, relationships and quality of life. That’s a downer, but there are simple and effective solutions, including the above mentioned pills. They are among seven different drugs commonly prescribed for erectile dysfunction. They all work in a similar fashion with some variation depending on the specific drug. Most are taken on an “as-needed” basis, an average of an hour before sex (3). The good news is that they are easy to take, considered safe and work for the majority of people (4). But like most drugs, there can be bothersome side effects, the most common of which are headaches, facial flushing and indigestion (4). So which one is best choice? Arecentsystematic reviewof the seven drugs analyzed 82randomized controlled trialsto measure effectiveness and another 72 randomized controlled trials to examine side effects (5). The review authors weigh the trade-offs between each drugs’ relative merits and drawbacks. Consistent with other studies, all seven of the drugs resulted in a reduction in erectile dysfunction compared with aplacebo. In other words: they  work! Unfortunately, there is no miracle pill that is both effective and free of side effects. In general, the review found that as the effectiveness of a drug increases, so does the risk of side effects. In this review of the ‘trade-offs,’ the most effective drug treatment was the 50mg dose of sildenafil (the active ingredient in Viagra, and also sold in generic forms). However it also had the highest risk of side effects – on average, men taking this drug had 18% increased risk of side effects compared to men taking a placebo. If that’s a concern, the 10mg does of tadalafil (sold as brand name Cialis, as well as in generic form) may be a preferred option (just 10% increased risk of side effects), but it comes at the expense of being less effective. A decision about which drug to choose involves weighing the risks and benefits of each treatment. A chart comparing seven common drugs for erectile dysfunction is available in ourevidence summary of this review. An alternative to medication may be lifestyle changes. There is evidence that losing weight, improving diet, and getting regular exercise (such as walking) can improve sexual function (6,7,8).

The characteristic problems with memory, thinking, language and judgment are a challenge, but there are also  “behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia” (BPSD), including agitation, aggression, wandering, resistance to care, delusions, hallucinations and repetitive speech. These symptoms can be very upsetting for people with dementia as well as their loved ones, and are often the reason people are admitted to long-term care (1). How do caregivers cope with these challenging behaviours? Often, doctors prescribe medications including antipsychotics, antidepressants and anti-anxiety drugs to help calm patients, but there are problems associated with drug use including side effects that can lead to serious health issues (2-4). Recent evidence recommends a shift in the way we manage challenging symptoms of dementia, valuing non-drug approaches that calm and reassure people as a first treatment step. What works best? Try one – or all – of these 3 non-drug approaches for people with dementia, supported by recent high quality research. Click on the titles for more information and to read the research summaries. 1.  Person-centred care: Getting to know all about you One of the most promising approaches involves an individualized person-centred model of care in which a person’s background, likes/dislikes, values, culture and abilities are taken into account to develop communication and care strategies that encourage positive responses and interactions (5-7). Person-centred care has also been shown tobenefit caregiversby promoting greater job satisfaction and preventing burnout (8). 2.  Sensory stimulation: The healing power of touch Various types of sensory stimulation, such as hand massage, can help improve behaviours and the general wellbeing of people with dementia (9). 3.  Music to soothe and relax Many people enjoy the uplifting and relaxing qualities of music. Relaxing music has been shown to promote cooperation during meal times. Listening to music of their choice while receiving one-on-one personal care—such as bathing—may also help improve behaviour among people with dementia who are more resistant to care (10). Similarly, receiving five or more sessions of a music-based therapeutic strategy can possibly reduce symptoms of depression and improve overall behavioural issues in people with dementia who are living in long-term care settings (11). Other drug-free strategies currently being studied for their impact on agitation among nursing home residents include bright light therapy, doll therapy, pet therapy, and aromatherapy (9;12;13). Considering the rapid rise in the rate of dementia and the toll it takes on individuals, families, caregivers and healthcare systems, it’s not surprising that experts are intent on exploring and testing new treatments and therapies. Non-drug approaches not only avoid the side effects of medication, there is increasing evidence that they help reduce challenging behaviours associated with dementia, making life a bit easier for people with dementia and their caregivers.']"

It can often be difficult to think beyond the pounding in your head! When a headache strikes, finding treatments that bring relief becomes a top priority. Treatment with painkillers at the first sign of pain is usually enough to curb many mild or infrequent headaches or migraines. However, when headache pain occurs more often or does not respond well to standard pain treatments, doctors will often prescribe preventative drugs. Unfortunately, many of these drugs produce unwanted side effects and are not well tolerated (1-3). Many adults suffering from chronic headaches or migraines are increasingly turning to alternative therapies for pain relief, such as acupuncture (4;5). Despite acupuncture’s popularity, its effectiveness in preventing headache pain has been controversial. Twosystematic reviewsaimed to find out more about whether acupuncture can actually help reduce how often people get headaches or migraines.One reviewincluded 12randomized controlled trialswith over 2300 adults suffering from frequent tension-type headaches for at least 6 months (6).The other reviewincluded 22 randomized controlled trials with just under 5000 adults suffering from 'episodic migraine': all participants reported having migraines for more than one year, less than 15 days per month (7). The reviews compared the number of headaches experienced by people who used acupuncture to people incontrol groupswho had routine care (treatment of their symptoms only), ‘fake’ acupuncture (needles placed in the wrong places, or not into the skin), and other treatments such as preventative drugs (7), or physiotherapy, massage and exercise (6). Only trials in which the participants had acupuncture every week for at least six weeks were included. Can acupuncture reduce the frequency of headaches or migraines? The available evidence suggests that it can, at least in the short-term. Three months after starting acupuncture treatment, frequent headache or migraine sufferers experienced significantly fewer headache days than those receiving routine care, treatment with 'fake' acupuncture, or treatment with preventative drugs. Both systematic reviews also found that acupuncture was safe and well tolerated. Overall, people receiving acupuncture reported fewer side effects and were less likely to drop out of the studies than those receiving drugs (6;7). Two, more recent, reviews looking at chronic pain further support the use of acupuncture for the treatment of headaches, as well as other forms of pain such as musculoskeletal and osteoarthritis (8;9).  In terms of whether acupuncture is effective both in the short-and long-term, the evidence is more mixed. For instance, older research shows only short-term benefits—at six months—(7), while newer research shows the potential for sustained pain relief—over at least one year (9). Future research will be useful to determine whether the number of needles or number of sessions impacts the benefits of acupuncture. Long-term studies comparing acupuncture to other non-drug treatments – such as physiotherapy, massage or exercise – are also needed. Regular acupuncture appears to be a good choice to help prevent chronic headaches and migraines. This alternative therapy may be particularly useful for people who don’t respond well to preventative drug treatment options or get adequate relief from this approach. As for the long-term benefits of acupuncture—the jury is still out, but there may be promise.""]"

Doesn’t it seem like the minute you get one thing fixed or replaced, something else breaks down? Cars, computers, appliances… even our hips and knees! That’s because they too are subject to “wear and tear” over time, contributing to the development of joint issues like osteoarthritis which causes pain, stiffness and decreased mobility. When painkillers, physiotherapy and other treatments aren’t enough to ease the suffering, doctors may recommend “arthroplasty,” surgery to remove some or all of the damaged joint and replace it with an artificial (metal and/or plastic) joint. It’s an increasingly common procedure: over the last 5 years the number of hip replacement surgeries has increased by nearly 20% in Canada (1). Standard hip replacement surgery\xa0is a\xa0""posterior""\xa0approach, requiring an\xa0incision – usually 10 cm or longer – along the side to the\xa0back\xa0of the hip in order to get at the joint. In recent years, there’s been a focus on less invasive techniques, such as making ‘mini-incisions’ (less than 10cm in length) to replace the joint. The theory is that by cutting into less tissue and muscle, there is less damage and blood loss, which in turn results in faster recovery (2). However some claim that the modified procedure increases the risk of complications such as hip dislocation and nerve injury (3). The results of asystematic reviewof 16 studies, including 12 high qualityrandomized controlled trials, help to inform the debate (4). More than 1,400 participants over the age of 60 had posterior hip replacement surgery  using either the standard approach or smaller incisions. They were compared in terms of operating time, loss of blood during surgery, length of hospital stay and presence of joint dislocation. They also underwent tests that measure characteristics like pain, stiffness and function. Mini-incision surgery for hip replacement appears to have some advantages including shorter time in the operation room, less blood loss during surgery, and a shorter hospital stay (an average of half a day) (4). There was no significant difference in complications between the two types of surgery, including hip dislocations, infections, nerve injuries and blood clots (4). According to Dr. Anthony Adili – Chief of Surgery at St. Joseph’s Healthcare in Hamilton, Ontario and an expert in hip and knee replacement – there is a bit more to the story. In his experience, the position of the implant and the amount of trauma to the surrounding tissues have the greatest impact on a patient\'s recovery after hip replacement. Because of this, the type of approach (these studies focused only onposteriorsurgery), the skill of the surgeon and the characteristics of individual patients are all important factors to consider when deciding whether mini-incision surgery is best for you. On the other hand, he says, surgical approaches have improved since these studies were conducted and impacts on recovery – such as length of hospital stay – may be better than those reported. Also, “another benefit of mini-incision surgery is cosmetic,” points out Dr. Adili, and a less-noticeable scar may be important to many people. So if your surgeon thinks mini–incision hip replacement surgery is right for you, you can be relieved to know that it is not likely to put you at any greater risk, and may even get you back to doing the “hippy hippy shake” a little sooner!']"

Almost everyone has experienced those feelings at one time or another and loneliness is very common among older adults. There are real health consequences to this social issue; loneliness and social isolation (the absence of fulfilling relationships, a sense of belonging and meaningful social contacts) can result in poor physical and mental health (1), lower quality of life (2),\xa0and\xa0even premature death (3) largely because of the strong relationship between social isolation and depression (4;5). You don’t have to live alone to feel lonely. In fact, social isolation is especially prevalent in long-term care facilities where residents are at high risk of suffering the debilitating effects of depression and a rapid decline in their physical and cognitive abilities as a result (5;6). Research suggests that providing opportunities for residents to actively participate in meaningful social activities can help draw people together and reduce isolation (7). While hobbies, preferences and tastes differ, it is useful to know which activities are worth signing up for, especially for people who are looking to combat or avoid depression. Asystematic reviewof five studies sought to better understand what programs and activities are best at addressing social isolation and depression among nursing home residents (8). The study participants ranged in age from 77 to 86 years and lived in long-term care facilities in urban communities. The activities included: Reminiscence therapy in groups, during which participants share personal stories and memories Women-only and men-only facilitator-led social groups Indoor gardening programs conducted with individuals or groups Weekly sessions incorporating Nintendo Wii® games Daily one-hour radio broadcasts Participants were assessed to determine their levels of depression, loneliness and various related symptoms, such as anxiety, well-being, and life satisfaction. Of all of the program options, reminiscence therapy was the most successful, significantly improving both social isolation and depression. Groups led by a program facilitator had the most value, particularly when the facilitators were well-trained (8). The effects of reminiscence therapy may even go beyond loneliness, with another review finding that it can improve quality of life, cognition, communication, and mood in people with dementia by a small amount (9). Among other effective programs, daily radio broadcasts and men’s social clubs decreased depression and gardening groups decreased loneliness. However, it should be noted that more research is needed about effective approaches for people living in rural areas whose circumstances and isolation may be different from those in urban areas (8). Overall, effective programs are ones that are adaptable and include community participation and productive engagement (11). So, joining a social or recreational group may be worth your while, especially if it includes a bit of a chit chat or a chin wag (12). As shown in previous studies, talking about accomplishments, reliving happy times and sharing experiences promotes self-esteem and a sense of fulfillment and comfort while helping people connect the past with the present (10). With age comes change and loss which can bring on feelings of loneliness and despair. Spending quality time with people is an excellent antidote, one that is even more effective when some of that time is spent sharing memories of a life well lived.']"

We may even have tried one or two only to discover they’re fads that don’t live up to their claims. As many studies have shown – and you may have heard before – the basis of most successful weight loss is eating less and exercising more. But just out of curiosity, which is more important? We often joke about needing to take an extra walk around the block to validate that extra slice of cake or serving of Thanksgiving turkey. Does exercisereallyhelp counter those extra calories, or do diet changes make a bigger difference? That’s what a recentsystematic reviewhoped to discover (1). It included 21randomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 3,500 overweight adults aged 35 to 70 who took part in diet and/or exercise programs lasting between 1-6 years. The diets emphasized low-fat, high fibre foods including fruits and vegetables, while the exercise programs included both aerobic activity (e.g. walking) and resistance training done on a regular basis. “Before and after” body measurements (weight, body fat and waist circumference) and cardiovascular health readings (fitness level, blood pressure and cholesterol) of all the participants were taken to help determine the most effective way to drop weight, reduce body fat and improve heart health. The verdict? Sorry, those extra steps are likely not enough to burn off extra calories. Like previous studies (2,3) the review confirms that changes in diet contribute more to weight loss than exercise. However, the review emphasizes that the best results come from a combination of both. As McMaster University’s Dr. Russell de Souza says, that’s the important message people should take to heart – literally! The overwhelming prevalence of obesity means that more and more people are at high risk for cardiovascular problems (4,5). Dr. de Souza, registered dietitian and nutrition epidemiologist with McMaster University’s Department of Clinical Epidemiology & Biostatistics, explains that diet and exercise actually work hand in hand to reduce the risk of heart disease by lowering body weight and fat as well as blood pressure – which is known as the “silent killer” because it is a significant factor in heart attacks and kidney disease (6,7). When it comes to weight loss, Dr. de Souza says the challenge is to go about it in a sensible, healthy way so that it’s sustainable. “When people go to extremes with exercise or diet it can result in injuries or rebound food cravings. I recommend people start off slow by going for the ‘low hanging fruit’ such as actually having a piece of fruit or a salad and walking for five minutes every day. Once that becomes a habit it is easier to incorporate other healthy actions.” The good news, he adds, is that once you start, your body responds very quickly to exercise so that before long five minutes becomes 30 minutes – or more – each day. You can ensure you are on the right track by monitoring your weight or BMI (body mass index) but Dr. de Souza suggests one of the best and simplest measures is waist circumference: men should aim to stay below 102 cm and women no more than 88 cm. Aiming even lower than these conservative estimates may be even better: a recentsystematic reviewfound that heart health risks increase for women with waist measurements over 75 cm (8). “The higher the number,” explains Dr. de Souza, “the more visceral fat being stored around your internal organs and in your liver.” Dr. de Souza believes successful weight loss takes patience and persistence. “It’s a long-term effort. It took some time to put on those pounds and it’s going to take some time to take them off in a way that’s healthy and will keep them off!”']"
276,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/09/07/does-caregiver-stress-affect-the-move-to-long-term-care,7 September 2016,Does caregiver stress affect the move to long term care?,"[""The escalating number of people with age-related chronic diseases and conditions has given rise to another staggering statistic: the number of unpaid family caregivers. In Canada alone, more than\xa0eight million people – or 28% of the population aged\xa015 and over – provide care to older adult family members or friends (1). While it may be a “labour of love” for some, it can be hard labour nonetheless. The stress and burden of caregiving can take a toll and impact caregivers’ physical and psychological health (2,3). Often, depleted caregivers are eventually faced with the realization that they can no longer provide adequate care and support. Then what? There is a commonly held belief that caregiver stress is a key factor in whether those receiving care are admitted to nursing homes or other long-term care facilities (4,5). But is it true? This question was the focus of a recentsystematic review, including 54 studies and close to 92,000 participants (6). The focus was on people 65 years and older with chronic care needs, living in the community and being cared for by an informal (usually family) caregiver. Various aspects of caregiver stress (anxiety, depression, burnout, strain, burden, or distress) were measured to see if there was an association between caregiver stress levels and the decision to move care recipients into long term care. Contrary to widespread belief, the study results showed that caregiver stress actually had very little impact on whether and when the people they care for were admitted to long term care. While caregiver stress may be one factor, it didn’t appear to be the deciding one. Instead, people were more likely to be admitted to long-term care if they had severe functional and cognitive impairments (e.g. dementia), were living with multiple chronic conditions or taking multiple medications, or previously spent time in a hospital or other care facility. Although the evidence is interesting and useful – particularly in demonstrating how research can disprove common assumptions – the review authors make the following additional comments: The study findings do not in any way minimize the stress associated with caregiving and the potential harmful effects on family members providing care to elderly loved ones. Results will vary depending on where people live and the healthcare systems that oversee professional assessments, the number of available long-term care beds, and the criteria for how they are allocated. The importance and value of informal/family caregivers cannot be overstated – not only in terms of their service to their loved ones, but in taking pressure off overloaded health care systems. Continued research and efforts aimed at supporting family caregivers is a step in the right direction. Barb is an informal caregiver who can relate to the challenges and conflicting emotions involved in the decision to transition loved ones into long term care. Her parents recently moved in with her when - due to his own health limitations - her father could no longer continue as the sole caregiver for her mother who has dementia. Since then, Barb has faced her share of caregiver stress. “The ongoing worry about the health of my parents, and my mother’s frequent, intense outbursts have put me in a constant state of anxiety,” she says. Although a home office helps her juggle both work and caregiving demands, “It is extremely difficult to concentrate on work,” she has found, “And I regret having to miss so many social opportunities and chances to relax.” The family has been assessed as “in crisis” and her parents are now on the wait list for long term care placement. Although caregiver stress has contributed to this decision, Barb mentions other factors which held equal or greater importance: Caregiving skills:Without adequate training, Barb feels she and her father “are not well equipped to handle the most challenging of the behaviours” related to her mother’s dementia. Caregiving respite / support: Barb is fortunate to have family members nearby to provide some respite. “They help by calling or visiting in order to give me a break.”\xa0 She has recently arranged for some private home support and taken advantage of assistance from crisis response counselors, the local Alzheimer’s Society, doctors/geriatricians and day program staff. Emotional impact on those receiving care: “My mother does not believe there is anything wrong with her and will very likely be even more distraught about going to a nursing home. I tried to find other solutions and ways to cope with the situation before taking that difficult step.” Health impacts on those receiving care: Barb feels that her mother “is not receiving the care and medications that might help address some of the symptoms of the disease. My father’s stress and lack of proper rest is taking a toll on his health and recently prompted a trip to the emergency room.” Barb's advice to caregivers is clear: Don’t suffer in silence and don’t do it alone! Talk to professionals, friends, family and other caregivers to share information and find out about local supports and services. Accept offers of help and arrange for respite whenever and however you can.""]"
277,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/08/29/3-tips-to-prevent-bed-sores,29 August 2016,3 tips to prevent bed sores,"['Our beds can be places of comfort and healing, whether we are recovering from an injury or illness or laid up due to mobility issues or frailty. Unfortunately, even when confined to our beds we can face complications that can lead to more discomfort and hinder our healing, such as pressure sores. Pressure sores - also called pressure ulcers and bed sores -\xa0are injuries to the skin and the tissue underneath caused by constant pressure or friction when sitting or lying down for a long time without changing position (1). Hospital patients and people who are immobile due to injury or medical conditions are especially vulnerable (2), as are frail older adults (3). Pressure sores are painful, often difficult to treat, can lead to even more serious complications and are a major burden for patients, their families and healthcare providers (4). One important solution is to prevent pressure sores in the first place by reducing the pressure on the body, but how? A recentsystematic reviewincluded 59 studies that examined various products and strategies with the goal of finding out whether they help prevent pressure sores as well as which ones are most effective (5). The strategies were designed to relieve pressure by either cushioning the bonier parts of the body - heels, knees, hips, tailbone -\xa0or by redistributing body weight. “Low-tech” options included mattresses with enhanced features, such as higher density foam and special fillings (gel, air, water or beads). The researchers also measured the benefits of mattress covers, overlays (e.g. medical grade sheepskin) and specially designed cushions (e.g. limb protectors, and wheelchair cushions). The studies also assessed some “high-tech” strategies such as alternating pressure mattresses featuring air pockets that mechanically fill and deflate to provide cushioning and relieve pressure. The good news is that low-tech, lower cost solutions do help. Research evidence shows that mattresses made with higher density foam can help prevent sores from developing or worsening. People who used these types of mattresses were less likely to develop pressure sores than people lying on standard foam mattresses of the type found in many homes and hospitals. Sheepskin overlays also helped lower the likelihood of pressure sores. Further study is needed to determine the benefits and cost effectiveness of high tech solutions like alternating pressure mattresses and other types of pressure-relieving mattresses and overlays. Another tip: remember to change position regularly. Although decisions about the best positions and how often to move are not universally agreed upon (6) and may depend on the type of support surface and condition of the patient (1), regular repositioning is still recognized and supported by research evidence as an effective and simple way to help prevent pressure sores (1,6,7). Setting an alarm or playing music on a regular schedule can help provide a cue that it’s time to move (7). Ontario nursing guidelines recommend changing sitting position at least once every hour (8). For people confined to beds and chairs, whether temporarily or long term, pressure sores are an additional, serious concern. It is good to know that relatively simple and inexpensive options are available to offer relief.']"

You’re not alone. Television, newspapers, magazines, radio, the internet... everywhere you turn there are ads and articles telling you what you should and shouldn’t eat. Unfortunately the information is often unproven, contradictory and just downright sketchy. It’s tempting to give up and give in to your sugar/salt/saturated fat cravings and let the chip crumbs fall where they may (usually between the seat cushions). But it’s a far better idea not to. A nutritious, well-balanced diet is important to health and well-being throughout the lifespan and helps us maintain strength, mobility and a good quality of life as we age. It’s never too late to make better food choices but some people try to do too much at once, which can lead to frustration and failure. Why not start with just a few changes, such as the five listed below? They’re simple, sensible and proven to help promote healthy aging based on research evidence from recent systematic reviews. Click the links to read the articles, including details about the\xa0research findings. 1. Please pass (up) the salt You’ve always heard that too much salt is bad for you. Now research confirms the benefits of cutting back: reducing your sodium intake will help lower your blood pressure, which in turn decreases your risk of heart disease. The main culprit is processed foods. 2. Nothing fishy about this advice Another good way to promote heart health is to eat more salmon, mackerel, tuna and other fish high in omega-3 fatty acids. Don’t like fish? Try fish oil supplements. Research shows that people with high blood pressure who took fish oil supplements saw a small drop in their blood pressure readings. 3. Cut the (saturated) fat When it comes to our diet, not all fat is created equal. Saturated fat – common in meat and dairy – is the one we need to be most concerned about. According to research, reducing the saturated fat in our daily diets and replacing some with healthier unsaturated fats – found in plant oils – can lower our risk of heart disease. 4. Go Mediterranean Need the structure of a diet plan to stay on track? There are so many to choose from, ranging from the sensible to the bizarre. The Mediterranean diet is one of the former. It supports\xa0the other recommendations by encouraging people to eat more vegetables, fruit, fish, whole grains and unsaturated fats such as olive oil. A vegetarian diet is another option that emphasizes similar foods and plant-based fats and protein.Diabetic?\xa0There is evidence that aMediterranean diet can also improve your blood sugar, insulin and blood pressure levels as well as help you lose weight. 5. Take care with your choice of tableware For people who are overweight or at risk of obesity, reducing portion sizes can help cut down on un-needed calories. Did you know that the size of the plate, package or portion you are offered can influence how much food you eat and drink? Use a smaller plate and say no to ‘super-sized’ portions to help avoid the health risks associated with weight gain. When you’re ready to make some healthy diet tweaks, the suggestions above are a good place to begin and can help get you on the right track without biting off more than you can chew (which is also another good eating tip). You can then incorporate additional nutrition and lifestyle changes as needed to help you achieve your own personal health goals. It’s also a good idea to discuss your diet plan with your doctor, particularly if you have a chronic disease or other medical condition that can be affected by your diet. Happily, there are a lot of foods that are both good tasting and good for you. Bon appétit!']"

Chalk it up to endorphins and other “feel good” chemicals in the brain that are released when we’re physically active. That at least partly explains why exercise is prescribed – often in combination with other therapies – to help reduce symptoms of depression (1). This widespread, chronic and often debilitating condition is particularly common among older adults (2). To make matters worse, depression is a difficult condition to treat (3). Many people are reluctant to admit to a mental illness (4) or don’t respond well to treatment with medication (5). People who do not receive adequate treatment for depression are at increased risk of other health problems (such as heart disease), and can suffer from lowered quality of life (2;6). Searching for solutions, researchers conducted studies to find out if exercise has the same depression-fighting benefits for older adults. Eighteen of those studies, involving more than 1,000 older adults with depression, were part ofasystematic review(7). Participants engaged in various types of exercise – mostly in a supervised setting – in programs that lasted between six and 24 weeks. Their before and after depression “scores,” were compared with those ofcontrol groupswho did not take part in the exercise programs (although some studies included an equal amount of social interaction) and received the usual care. Exercise was shown to have a ‘moderate’ effect in helping to combat depression in the study participants. That’s encouraging and supports recommendations for making exercise part of the treatment plans for older adults diagnosed with depression, or who are at risk of depression. According to the evidence, all types of exercise are beneficial but “alternative” programs, such as Tai Chi and Qi Gong, were found to be most effective. The review authors suggest that may be due to the emphasis on both the body and mind through slow, controlled movements, meditation, breathing and relaxation techniques. Several other studies have demonstrated similar findings. For example,asystematic reviewof fourrandomized controlled trialsfound that older adults who took part in Tai Chi sessions on a regular basis reported significant decreases in depression symptoms (8). Tai Chi is a particularly good exercise for older adults as there is minimal risk and it is suitable for those with limited mobility and/or medical conditions that prevent them from engaging in more demanding physical activities (8). Another morerecentsystematic reviewof 33randomized controlled trialsfound that resistance training (a type of exercise meant to increase strength) led to significant decreases in symptoms of depression. It did not matter how much resistance training a person did, how healthy they were, or how much their strength improved—depressive symptoms were reduced regardless (9). Depression can have severe consequences for older adults and better ways to diagnose and treat the disorder are urgently needed. Though it may not provide a cure, exercise can be recommended as an easy and safe addition to depression treatment – with few negative side effects and many additional benefits – to help reduce depression symptoms and promote a healthier outlook.

The controversy over its legalization, production, use and distribution may be trending now but cannabis itself is far from being a new phenomenon. In the 1980s, cannabinoids – active chemicals found in cannabis – were approved for medical purposes such as treating the nausea and vomiting associated with chemotherapy (1). Up to 75% of cancer patients experience these symptoms (2) which are considered to be the most upsetting and stressful side effect of chemotherapy treatment (3). But are cannabinoids any better than conventional anti-sickness medications? Or will they cause yet another set of worrisome side effects? To get clarity about the highs and lows of cannabis-based medication,a recentsystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 23randomized controlled trialsinvolving people with moderate to severe nausea and vomiting while undergoing chemotherapy cancer treatment (4). The study participants were given one of two approved cannabinoids – nabilone and dronabinol – and monitored to see whether the medication effectively controlled nausea and/or vomiting in the short term (within 24 hours of chemotherapy) and in the longer term (more than 24 hours after treatment). The results were compared patients who received a placebo as well as with patients who received conventional anti-sickness medication. Cannabinoids did help control nausea and vomiting for people receiving chemotherapy and appeared to be just as effective as conventional anti-sickness medications, which means they may be a good alternative for people who don’t benefit from traditional drugs. However there is a greater chance of side effects – some of the participants taking cannabinoids reported feeling “high”: dizzy, disoriented, sedated or uneasy. Despite that, in trials where participants were able to take and compare cannabinoids and conventional drugs, the majority preferred the cannabis-based medication. The review authors do note that the comparison to conventional drugs might not reflect current chemotherapy treatment options which have improved in the meantime. The review hints at the potential benefits of cannabis-based drug therapies but more research is urgently needed, particularly in light of regulatory changes in Canada giving eligible patients access to “medical marijuana.” Meanwhile, more high quality studies will help us know whether cannabis and cannabis-based medications truly are preferable to the drugs we have now, or whether it’s another instance of the grass being greener on the other side.']"

It’s hard to relax and you don’t want to move any more than necessary for fear of making the back pain worse. As for exercise – this is one time you feel completely justified in skipping your workout. But before you retire to the couch with your hot water bottle, you should know that exercise may actually help get you relief from persistent back pain. Low back pain is such a common health problem, it’s a load most of us will bear in adulthood.\xa0 In fact, it is estimated that as many as 70% of adults suffer from this chronic condition (1;2). We know there are many contributing factors: age, physical fitness and general health, occupational requirements (e.g. heavy lifting and/or repetitive movements), stress and anxiety levels\xa0(2), but there is much we don’t understand about who will be affected, or when, or by what degree. When back pain strikes, treatment options are limited and often aren’t very effective in providing adequate relief (3). Exercise therapy for relief of low back pain isn’t a new concept; it’s consistently recommended based on studies that show it helps improve physical function (strength, flexibility and range of motion) and reduces pain, at least to a small degree (4-8). But what works best? Are some exercises more effective than others when it comes to relief of low back pain? Asystematic reviewof 45randomized controlled trialsprovides some answers (8). The studies involved 4,462 adults between the ages of 30 and 62 who had low back pain. They participated in one of four different categories of exercise programs: coordination/stabilization – focusing on balance and agility strength/resistance – targeting major muscle groups cardio-respiratory – aerobic and continuous motion combined exercises (with more than one component – eg. strengthening, stretching and aerobic training) The exercise programs lasted from one and a half to 18 weeks, after which participants’ pain scores were compared with those incontrol groupwho carried on with their usual activities or received other types of therapy for their back pain. Evidence from the review confirms that exercise is good for people with bad backs, however not all exercises are equal when it comes to reducing pain. Strength and resistance training appear to be the most effective with participants reporting “medium” improvement, followed by coordination/stabilization exercises that reduced pain by a small amount. Cardio exercises and combined exercises had little significant impact on pain levels (8). While exercise may not completely relieve your back problems, it is a non-surgical, drug free and low cost therapy that may help ease your pain and discomfort and improve your range of motion.

282,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/06/28/the-shingles-vaccine-should-you-get-it,28 June 2016,The shingles vaccine: Should you get it?,"['If you’re lucky, the only “shingles” you need to concern yourself with are the ones on the roof of your home. But if you’re among the many to have experienced this medical condition, you know only too well how much pain, discomfort and distress it can cause. Shingles is the common name forherpes zoster, which is caused by the same virus responsible for chicken pox (1). Anyone who has had chicken pox (usually as a child) is at risk of developing shingles because the varicella virus can stay “asleep” in the body for decades before becoming active again and causing more grief – generally in the form of an itchy, blistering and often excruciating rash on one side of the body or face (1). The infection usually heals within two to four weeks (2) but the pain can last much longer, and in rare cases can cause severe and permanent damage including blindness (3). Older adults and others with weakened immune systems are particularly vulnerable and the risk of getting shingles increases with age (4). Unlike chicken pox, shingles can strike more than once and as Dr. Mark Loeb - a professor in the Department of Pathology and Molecular Medicine at McMaster University - points out, another complication can be even more worrisome. ""Postherpetic neuralgia” can affect up to one in three people with shingles and usually occurs up to a month after the rash appears. As Dr. Loeb describes, it can range “from mild to really excruciating pain after the rash has resolved and can persist for weeks, months, even several years. This pain can disrupt sleep, work or activities of daily living."" What can you do to protect yourself? At the moment, there is no way to completely prevent the virus from attacking, however a single-dose vaccine is available that will significantly reduce your risk. Thirteen studies were included inasystematic reviewassessing the effectiveness of the vaccine. Participants – all healthy adults over the age of 60 – were given either the vaccine or aplaceboand monitored to see if they developed shingles as well as any longer-term nerve damage (5). The evidence shows that those receiving the vaccine were 51% less likely to get shingles and 67% less likely to get postherpetic neuralgia than those who didn’t. As it’s a ‘live’ vaccine, side effects may include redness and itching, usually where the vaccine was injected, but most people tolerate the vaccine well with minimal side effects (5). So should you get the shot? “The bottom line is you can get excruciating pain that can linger for a long time, and there is a way to help prevent it,” Dr. Loeb says. “The shingles vaccine has a proven track record, is safe, effective and well tolerated. For people aged 60 and over, I would recommend it.” The good news doesn’t end there! The review mentioned above also included trials involving a newer vaccine that showed some promising early results—the potential to cut the risk of getting shingles by more than 90% (5). This two-dose vaccine is now available in Canada (6), and suggestions that it could be superior to the original single-dose shingles shot are supported by a recentlypublishedsystematic review(7). However, with greater effectiveness may come a higher risk of side effects—such as swelling—at the area the vaccine is injected. Seeing as this vaccine is newer, more research is needed to get a better picture of how it stacks up against the original shingles vaccine in terms of safety, impact on other shingles-related outcomes, cost-effectiveness, and more (7). Talk to your health care provider about your options for vaccination against shingles. As someone who has already had shingles twice, retired Hamilton, Ontario resident Jean also recommends the vaccine (at the time only the single-dose vaccine was available). Although she noticed the symptoms in time to get medication and avoid the worst of the rash and pain, she is surprised by how quickly the symptoms appeared and spread. The first instance occurred about four years ago. “I was taking a shower and noticed a four inch red mark that swooped down my back in a crescent shape – as if the water had scalded that area.” That experience prompted Jean to act immediately when she saw another spot starting to form. Shortly after that episode she decided to get the vaccine, but recognizes that without a drug plan, some people might hesitate due to the cost. Fortunately, thevaccine is now free for eligible adults ages 65-70 in Ontario. All in all, she believes she did the right thing, especially after learning about severe cases in which people got shingles in the eye or tongue. “If it reduces my chance of having problems in the future, then it’s worth it. I knew that the vaccine was not a guarantee that I would never get shingles, but in my case it certainly made sense to get it!”']"

Although CVD remains a leading cause of death and illness world-wide, in the past 40 years the death rate from CVD has dropped dramatically in Canada, and many other countries (1,2). Now the not-so-good news: while advancement in treatment means fewer people die from a heart attack or stroke, it doesn’t necessarily mean survivors go on to lead healthy and active lives for their remaining years. Many survivors are at risk of experiencing subsequent health crises due in large part to not knowing what they need to do to recover and not being successful in maintaining the kinds of lifestyle changes that will help keep them healthy (1). A poll conducted by the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation in 2013 of more than 2,000 heart attack and stroke survivors found that many find it difficult to make and maintain important changes such as getting enough physical activity, managing stress and maintaining a healthy weight (1). With increasing numbers of people living with CVD (2), and millions of Canadians without a family doctor who can help them manage their chronic health conditions (3), nurse-led clinics are one way to bridge the gap between patient needs and health care resources. Canada is a world leader in implementing clinics staffed by nurses and nurse-practitioners to help ensure patients can access health and medical care that meets their needs. For example, more than 20 nurse practitioner-led clinics currently offer care throughout Ontario, and in Manitoba QuickCare clinics offer nurse-led urgent care for walk-in and after-hours patients. Nurse-led clinics deliver a comprehensive set of services including primary care, management of chronic diseases and conditions, referrals to other services, health education and promotion (4)... but do they actually benefit patient health? To address this question, twelverandomized controlled trialswere included in a recentsystematic reviewthat explored whether nurse-led clinics (in Canada, the US and the UK) help to improve health and decrease death rates among patients with heart disease (5).The studies involved close to 10,000 participants, all of whom had suffered serious heart problems including heart attacks and strokes. The study group received follow-up treatment and care at nurse-led clinics and acontrol groupreceived the usual care. Nurse-led clinics were shown to significantly reduce death rates – not only from heart disease but from all causes. They also were effective in helping patients consistently take their medications as prescribed, and in maintaining healthy lifestyle choices (eg. diet). The included studies were rated as ‘moderate quality’ and varied greatly in the types and complexity of treatment offered, the condition of the patients and the expertise of the nurses offering care. While the currently available evidence supports nurse-led clinics, the review authors suggest additional studies are needed to determine their long-term benefits as well as how best to implement nurse-led care (5). Nurse-led clinics may be your solution to getting the information, referrals and medical care that meets your needs.

So when people find out they have heart failure their reaction is often shock, followed by fear. Heart failure occurs when the heart becomes weak and is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body (1). The weakness may be the result of a previous heart related disease (e.g. a heart attack) or it could be caused by an infection, high blood pressure, toxins such as alcohol and drugs or another medical condition (1). Complications from a weak heart often result in people retaining fluid, which in turn can cause swelling in various parts of the body, as well as coughing, feeling tired and short of breath. Sometimes enough fluid collects in the lungs to cause a life-threatening condition called acute pulmonary edema (2). So yes, it’s serious. But although there’s no cure, it isn’t hopeless. People can function with the condition; currently an estimated 600,000 Canadians are living with heart failure (2). They can even enjoy a good quality of life by closely managing their medication and caring for themselves with a healthy diet and regular exercise (1). However, despite the fact that guidelines for heart failure patients includes providing information and self-care instructions (3), many people with heart failure don’t make lifestyle changes that promote heart health (4). Obviously there is a gap between the information patients are given and what they do (5;6). A recentsystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 37 studies in an effort to uncover ways of encouraging people to make important lifestyle changes and stick with them for the long term (7). The studies involved more than 1,300 heart failure patients as well as 75 caregivers to find out their general understanding of heart failure, their knowledge about self-care (including managing medication, diet, physical activity and fluids), as well as their experiences and challenges with self-care. The evidence confirms experts’ suspicions: when it comes to heart failure it’s not enough to simply give people information. They may read and have a basic understanding of the steps that need to be taken (e.g. what foods to avoid, which exercises to do, how much liquid to drink) but some people have difficulty knowing how to incorporate the recommendations into their own lives (7). A personalized, targeted approach may be a solution. For example, healthcare professionals can work with patients to develop a customized self-care plan that acknowledges how their symptoms affect them and suits their needs, abilities and preferences. Related recommendations include seeking patients’ feedback, understanding their personal experiences, offering coaching, and promoting a sense of control (8). Certain psychological strategies that aim to change negative thoughts or increase motivation and resolve conflicting feelings—such as cognitive behavioural therapy or motivational interviewing—can also be useful tools. Evidence shows that these strategies may improve self-care and health-related quality of life, in the short-term, among people with heart failure but no diagnosis of major depression or cognitive impairment (9). The use of ‘decision aids’ (tools that guide people through the process of making difficult decisions) may also be useful in putting together an effective self-care program (8). The goal is to have patients “take to heart” the messages they receive about their diagnosis and to give them the support they need to take care and take responsibility for their own health.

It can be confusing and it can cause us to doubt everything we read, hear or ever believed! For example, for years we’ve been told to watch our salt intake to avoid high blood pressure, a worrisome condition as it puts us at greater risk for heart attacks and strokes.(1) But is cutting back on salt going to make enough of a difference? And can consuming too little salt cause other problems? That has been the focus of numerous research studies, including 34randomized controlled trialsthat were included in asystematic review.(2) The studies involved more than 3,200 people between the ages of 22 and 73. Two thirds had high blood pressure; the rest had normal blood pressure. The average reduction in salt intake was 4,400 mg per day over a minimum of four weeks. Most American adults require no more than 6,000 mg of salt per day, while certain groups like African Americans, adults 51 and over, and people with conditions like hypertension, diabetes and chronic kidney disease should reduce their daily salt intake to 4,000mg. Unfortunately, most people consume much more salt than recommended. The pre-study salt intake for the participants in the review was 7,300 to 11,700 mg – the equivalent of three to five teaspoons of salt.(2) We are right to cut back! The evidence was strong that reducing salt intake lowers blood pressure in adults, regardless of sex or ethnicity and without any adverse effects. Improvements were greatest in people with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure decreased an average of 5.39 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure decreased an average of 2.82 mm Hg) but notable drops were also seen in people with normal blood pressure. The research also suggests that greater reductions in salt intake will likely decrease blood pressure even further. As a result several developed countries are revising their recommended targets and adopting policies to reduce salt intake.(3) So if reducing our salt intake is a prudent course of action and one that will significantly lower our risk of heart disease and stroke, what’s the best way to do it? A less liberal use of the salt shaker will help. But the real culprit, accounting for up to 85% of our salt consumption, is processed foods. A few sausage links or slices of bacon can account for more than half your daily salt limit. Canned foods, cheeses, breads, cereals, sauces and pickles are among the many other foods that are high in sodium. It is further support for a diet high in whole, natural and fresh food.']"
286,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/05/30/do-self-management-programs-for-diabetes-really-work,30 May 2016,Do self-management programs for diabetes really work?,"['Aging and diabetes. The first is inevitable; the other is increasingly more common (1). Each comes with its own set of challenges but put them together and you’ve got a potential powder keg of health issues to contend with. Diabetes care for older adults has a unique set of challenges, points out Dr. Diana Sherifali – a Clinical Nurse Specialist with the Diabetes Care and Research Program at Hamilton Health Sciences.\xa0 Many older adults are living with more than one disease (multimorbidity) and trying to juggle multiple medications to treat or manage their conditions. “It’s not just diabetes that’s competing for their attention. It could be arthritis, osteoporosis, chronic back pain, blood pressure, heart failure… you name it,” Dr. Sherifali says, “We may prescribe medications for diabetes, but how does that impact or interfere with other health issues?” She calls it a “huge conundrum” that must be addressed in order to help older adults with diabetes live as well as possible. Chronic diseases like diabetes are often “self-managed,” a widely supported care model that empowers patients to be in control of their own treatments (2). But given the number of older adults also managing other conditions, medications and other age-related issues, questions remain about whether that approach is right for everyone. To address that gap in knowledge, Dr. Sherifali led asystematic reviewandmeta analysisof 13randomized controlled trialsto determine which features of a diabetes self-management program are most effective in helping older adults cope successfully with the disease (3). The studies involved more than 4,500 participants – all over the age of 65 and living with diabetes. About half were randomly assigned to one of four self-management programs, each focusing on a particular approach: tailored/individualized support; group settings; education and feedback; and an emphasis on psychological issues. Participants’ blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol readings were measured and compared to participants incontrol groupsor usual diabetes education programs (3). According to the review evidence, diabetes self-management programs can benefit older adults. There was a small but significant drop in blood sugar levels, as well as slight decreases in blood pressure and cholesterol in the study group participants. Programs that offer tailored support based on the needs, goals and situations of the individual were most effective, followed by programs that address psychological issues including distress and depression (3). Self-management programs featuring technology may also be helpful for people managing their diabetes – a recent review found that mobile phone apps can help control blood sugar levels in people with type 2 diabetes (4). Dr. Sherifali says she’s not surprised by the results (3) and believes tailoring programs to people’s individual needs is the only way to go given the diversity in the senior population in terms of health and how they live. “We know folks who are 65 that look like they’re 85 and are immobile or frail. And we know 80 year olds that are still active and run half marathons!” Likewise, programs with a psychological emphasis help address both the physical and emotional needs of older adults as one directly affects the other and has implications for how well they take care of themselves: “Are they coping? Are they lonely? Do they have support? Maybe they’ve lost a loved one, their driver’s license or they’re retired. Some of those things are part and parcel of aging. But negative emotions may also be reflective of their multi-morbidity or medications.” Dr. Sherifali says having the “big picture” is the first step in understanding how best to support patients in managing their diabetes. She says the next step is adapting programs to better address those unique limitations and needs. That could mean healthcare providers schedule more time with patients to learn about their circumstances, develop a workable program, screen for other conditions that could further complicate self-management (cognitive impairment, for example) and consult with family members and caregivers as needed. Self-management can be an effective care strategy for older adults with diabetes, but it doesn’t mean they have to do it all by themselves. As Dr. Sherifali maintains, tailored support and frequent follow ups will go a long way towards keeping people out of the hospital and better able to enjoy their senior years.

Tests of cognitive skills that can flag older drivers who may be unsafe behind the wheel,"[""The birth of the modern automobile was credited to German inventor Karl Benz in 1886 (1), but the rise of 'car culture' is a more recent phenomenon. Our dependence on the car as a form of transportation is firmly linked with those born between the years 1946 and 1964. This is the generation known as the 'baby boomers'. The majority of baby boomers have now reached the age of 65 and they will comprise the largest segment of licensed drivers in Canada (2). Baby boomers love their cars and the independence it gives them. Seniors with a driver's license and a car are more likely to participate in social activities that have been linked to quality of life (2). Although, driving a car in older adulthood can facilitate social connectedness (meeting friends and family), there nevertheless is cause for concern (2). Next to teenagers, those aged 70 and older have the highest car collision rates when distance driven is considered. Unfortunately, seniors are more likely to be killed or seriously injured when involved in a crash due, in part, to physical frailty (2). In addition, the percentage of at-fault crashes increases from 38% for drivers aged 45-54 to 66% for those aged 75-84 (3;4). The research also suggests that there is a greater risk of collisions at intersections occurring during daylight hours, and a higher likelihood of involving multiple vehicles (5). Car crashes involving seniors are also more likely to occur when the weather conditions are ideal (6). However, it is important to emphasize that not all seniors are prone to car crashes or are unsafe drivers. Problems with seniors' driving have been linked to changes in their medical and functional status. This means that problems with driving are not related to normal aging changes but likely other health issues. The key issue is to adequately assess when there are potential problems that might place people at risk when they are driving. Driving is a complex task that involves many different skills and body functions. To drive safely we need to integrate our visual, cognitive (brain function), physical, and perceptual skills. As people age, they are more likely to develop health conditions that impair these skills and this may negatively affect their driving ability (2;7). Of particular concern is the sub-group of drivers who may not recognize their declining abilities due to cognitive impairment (brain function). In Ontario alone, the number of drivers with dementia is expected to double in the next few years, reaching 100,000 by 2028 (8). As a result, it will be important to assess those who may not recognize that they are having problems. Licensing bodies are focusing on developing ways of screening drivers. These screening tests will serve to flag those with cognitive problems. Currently, there is no single test that has been developed that can determine if a driver is 'cognitively-unfit' per se. However, there is evidence that performance on certain assessment tools can flag those drivers who require a more in-depth evaluation. The Clock-Drawing Test is one example of such a tool (9). There is scientific evidence that not being able to perform a seemingly quick and simple task, such as drawing a clock, is linked to one's ability to drive a car. Drawing a clock is actually considered to be a brain task that requires a higher level of brain function. The Clock-Drawing Test can indicate deficits related to your visual perception (9). As well, the Clock-Drawing Test can identify problems with short term memory and planning (9). There are a number of valid scoring methods for the Clock-Drawing Test that include the order, spacing and placement of the numbers and clock hands. The person being assessed is usually asked to draw a certain time on the clock, which is scored in terms of accuracy. Figure taken fromUnderstanding Dementia: A Primer of Diagnosis and Management, ©Kenneth Rockwood & Chris MacKnight, 2001. The Clock-Drawing Test was not developed for the specific purpose of evaluating driving in seniors. However, the research evidence evaluating the Clock-Drawing Test for assessing driving ability has been shown to be of moderate to strong quality. The research shows that the Clock-Drawing Test is a quick and easy way to identify drivers who may be experiencing cognitive changes (9;10;11). However, performance on the clock drawing test alone is not sufficient to revoke a person's license. Researchers have suggested that this test, alongside other screening mechanisms, be used as part of a first step when assessing fitness to drive in older adults (12). In fact, the Ontario Ministry of Transportation has recently instituted a version of the Clock-Drawing Test as part of its Senior Driver Renewal Program that targets drivers aged 80 and older (13). Driving enables seniors to remain connected to their communities, maintain social ties, and access needed services, particularly in rural areas lacking public transit (2). Loss of licensure in older adulthood, whether voluntary or otherwise, has negative consequences, including depression (14), reduced out-of-home activity levels, social isolation, loneliness (15) and a higher risk of placement in long term care (16). Any changes in licensing policies and procedures that affect older drivers (due to concerns with public safety) need to consider all the consequences. Taking away a senior's license because of potential risk, must be balanced with potential negative consequences to the mobility and health of older adults.""]"

Research evidence provides clarity,"['“Eat your carrots – they’re good for your eyes.” You probably heard that more than once as a child. Maybe you even ate extra servings - trusting they’d keep you from needing glasses. Actually, it’s not just a ploy to get stubborn kids to eat their vegetables. Carrots may not guarantee 20/20 vision, but they do have nutrients like beta-carotene, which is converted by the body into vitamin A – essential to eye health (1). Beta-carotene is also in other orange foods: yams, papayas, mangoes, etc (2) and green leafy produce including spinach and kale (2). Vitamin A and other “antioxidant” vitamins including C and E and minerals such as selenium and zinc, help counteract the processes that lead to vision impairment and other medical issues. That’s why nutritionists champion these fruits and vegetables as part of a healthy diet (2). Now vitamin supplements containing high concentrations of antioxidants are increasingly being marketed for their benefits in preventing age-related eye disease, specifically cataract and macular degeneration (AMD) (6;7). These eye diseases commonly develop with age and can lead to serious consequences, including vision loss (2;3). While we’d like it to be true, do these vitamins really help prevent or slow the progress of aging-related vision problems or are they a waste of money? Fortunately, researchers wanted answers to these same questions and carried out studies to find out if consumption of antioxidant vitamins have any impact on the development of cataracts or AMD. Some of those studies were included in three well-donesystematic reviews:oneon cataracts including nine randomized controlled trials and more than 117,000 participants (6); andanothertwoon AMD including a combined 24 randomized controlled trials and more than 80,000 participants (7;8). Those in the study groups were given antioxidant vitamin supplements including beta-carotene, vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein, and zinc. Researchers measured the number of people who developed cataracts or AMD and compared this to control groups who were given placebos or no supplements. These trials ranged from six months to 12 years in duration (6-8). The results were consistent and conclusive: taking antioxidant vitamins – single vitamins or in combination – does not help prevent either age-related cataracts or AMD (6;7).  However, in those with AMD, antioxidant vitamin and mineral supplementation may slow down the progression of the disease, particularly in people at high risk of having progression occur—like those with moderately severe AMD. It’s important to note that this potentially positive outcome was seen in an American population that was considered to be well-nourished. So, whether this finding can be applied to various populations still requires more precise and direct research (8). There were no serious vision-related side effects from taking supplements, but a significant percentage (7% to 16%) of people taking beta-carotene as part of the cataract studies experienced “hypercarotenodermia,” yellowing of the skin (6). The AMD review cautioned against high dose supplements as not enough is known about their impact; for example two of the included trials noted a slightly higher risk of lung cancer in the study participants (7). So there we have it: vitamin supplements likely won’t help you avoid these eye diseases and may possibly cause harm. But as the review authors hasten to add: keep eating your coloured vegetables! The recommended daily allowances of antioxidant vitamins and minerals that we get through healthy foods can still help to keep our eyes – and the rest of our bodies – functioning well for as long as possible (6).']"

For example, telemedicine is a promising strategy aided by technology that allows patients to consult with their healthcare team by sending pictures by email or using online video. This approach can also make it easier for the primary care team to share information with specialists (1,2). Telemedicine is proving useful for people with mobility problems such as leg and foot ulcers developed as a complication of diabetes.\xa0 Ulcers can take a long time to heal and – after diagnosis and initial treatment – patients often need multiple follow-up appointments with their health care team and referral to specialist care when necessary (3). All of this takes time and can be costly for both patients and the healthcare system (3,4,5). According to Dr. Perry Mayer – a doctor and expert in the treatment of the diabetic foot – telemedicine is not going to replace medical professionals but it is the way of the future: “It’s an area of medicine which is under-recognized. Rates of diabetes are exploding, including among people in isolated areas and we are going to have to use technology to reach them.” \xa0Dr. Mayer stresses that foot disease is one of the most prevalent complications of diabetes, with “terrible effects.” More than 3 million Canadians live with diagnosed diabetes and considerably more have undiagnosed or pre-diabetes (6). As diabetes reaches what Dr. Mayer calls “epidemic proportions,” the conversation about how best to treat foot wounds will become even more important. Researchers in Norway recently scanned the literature to measure the impacts of telemedicine vs usual care for patients with leg and foot ulcers (2). The authors found onlyone relevant US study, which compared 20 patients with diabetic-related foot ulcers who were treated via telemedicine with 120 patients who were treated face-to-face at a diabetic foot program. The patients who received follow-up care through telemedicine received similar care to those who were treated face-to-face. The healing time and the number of ulcers healed at 12 weeks were similar for both groups (7). The authors concluded that patients who use telemedicine for follow-up foot ulcer care do not face a greater risk of health problems than those treated in-person and can spend less time travelling. This approach may even result in lower healthcare costs (2). This is good news for people who may have difficulty getting to and from their medical appointments or accessing specialist health care. These findings should be viewed cautiously because they are based on a single – and relatively small – study.\xa0 However, an earliersystematic reviewincluding 26 studies and over 5000 people also found evidence that home telemonitoring helps improve blood sugar control for people with diabetes – promising findings that point to the potential of this relatively new area of healthcare (8). The researchers recommend more carefully controlled studies of larger groups of patients, with a longer follow-up time (2,8). The professional perspective – Dr. Perry Mayer According to Dr. Mayer, who has consulted as a specialist via telemedicine in Ontario, there are many advantages to using telemedicine for diabetic foot care: Access to specialist care for those who wouldn’t otherwise get it: “It’s all well and good to say every patient should have a doctor, but that probably won’t happen. We can leverage technology to offer that.” “Believe it or not, there’s a lot a foot care specialist can do just seeing the wound and talking with the patient and having a local nurse or doctor provide the care on their end.” \xa0After the first telemedicine appointment, follow-up can be as easy as a phone call or sending a note or picture. Mentorship / teaching of local health professionals Telemedicine allows foot care specialists to mentor and educate family physicians and other local health professionals about diabetic foot disease so they may be better able to recognize and treat ulcers independently.\xa0 “Telemedicine is practical and more interactive way to facilitate this.” Connecting with patients: “I can confirm a diagnosis with tests but the advantage of telemedicine is hearing from the patient directly and listening to the words they use to describe their condition.” Better communication can also improve the patient’s understanding of the problem and can encourage them to follow treatment instructions. In Ontario, theOntario Telemedicine Networkoffers telemedicine options for mental health, dermatology and other specializations.\xa0 Although Dr. Mayer says there is “great potential” for the service to help reach people at risk of diabetic foot disease, a pilot project he was involved with found that physicians do not always use the service when it is available to them. He stresses the importance of increasing awareness among physicians of both the seriousness of diabetic foot disease and the potential of telemedicine to help diagnose and treat it.

Should patients manage their own pain after surgery?,"['You’ve just had surgery. You’re glad it went well, but you’re in pain. You want relief and you want it NOW. Depending on the options available, either you wait to ask a nurse for more pain killers or you simply press a button that operates an electronically controlled pump connected to your IV tube and a dose of pain medication is immediately released into your system. Many patients still depend on medical staff to dispense medications, usually at specific times according to doctors’ orders. Dr. Jason Busse and his colleagues at McMaster University focus on understanding and treating persistent pain after surgery, generally managed by pain killers such as morphine. He points out some drawbacks with a staff-managed approach: “Everybody experiences discomfort differently… some patients will require a little bit more, some a little bit less.” Patients may also be hesitant to interrupt nurses to ask for more drugs, which can add to their anxiety and sense of helplessness. “People who are more worried tend to experience more pain. So if you can provide some sense of control - that is going to address some of the anxiety they have about their recovery.” That’s where PCA – patient controlled analgesia – comes in. Since the development in the late 1960s of special devices (1;2) it is becoming more common for patients to administer the drugs themselves (3). There are built-in safeguards to prevent overdoses – the devices are programmed to dispense a limited amount of the drug at a time (4;6) and Dr. Busse says patients typically have to wait 10 to 15 minutes between doses. Studies consistently show that PCA is the preferred approach to pain management as it ensures patients get their pain medications without delay (5). But just because they have more control, do they really have less pain? And are there any risks to their personal safety? Those are the questions arecentsystematic reviewhoped to answer. It included 49randomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 3,400 study participants who had undergone surgery (6). A little more than half received PCA while patients in acontrol groupwaited for nursing staff to dispense medication. Pain “scores” for both groups were measured and recorded for up to a few days after surgery. Giving patients control over their pain medications does appear to lead to a modest reduction in pain. But perhaps more interesting (and an even stronger result in this study) is that 81% of those in control of their pain medication were satisfied with their pain management versus only 61% who did not have this option (6). “That is significant,” says Dr. Busse. As he points out, this satisfaction may come more from patients’ feelings of engagement in their own recovery after surgery, as opposed to any dramatic difference in pain relief. As might be expected, PCA patients used more of the pain killing drugs – particularly on the second day following surgery. However, the difference was small and there was no significant difference in serious side effects (e.g. nausea/vomiting or breathing problems) between those who controlled their own pain medication and those who did not. There was also no significant difference in patients’ length of hospital stay (6). Only itching was more common among PCA patients (15% vs. 8%). “So maybe a little more itchiness, significantly more satisfaction and a little more pain relief… probably the majority of patients would be comfortable with that tradeoff,” Dr. Busse says. As he points out, there are enough reasons to feel nervous and vulnerable when you’re having surgery and very few opportunities to feel empowered. Being in control of your own pain medication may help ease both body and mind. Music can help ease your hospital stay']"

Using technology to promote healthy aging,"['Whether you’re the type that can’t wait for the release of the newest electronic device, or you long for the ‘good old days’ when life was simpler with less screen time, the fact remains that technology now impacts almost every aspect of life – including health and wellness. Embracing technology can be to our benefit, particularly when it comes to a living a healthy lifestyle. When we resolve (again) to exercise more or to eat better, there are more options than ever for tracking our progress including “smart wearables,” computer applications, activity monitors and a wide range of devices, gadgets and doodads to help us meet our goals. So how come we’re not all at our ideal weight and fitness level!? Are these devices just another collection of pricey electronic toys – destined to be lost and forgotten when the novelty has worn off – or do they really help people become healthier and more active? Research evidence from recentsystematic reviewssheds light on the value of some of the current technology-based options for improving health, promoting lifestyle changes that aim to protect against heart disease and other chronic conditions. Click on the titles to read more, including details about the research findings. Portable and wearable technology – from simple pedometers to high-tech digital monitors – have been shown to increase physical activity in at-risk populations including those who are overweight or obese, sedentary older adults and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes. Texting is not just for the kids anymore – adults of all ages have taken to this mode of relaying short messages instantly. Studies show that motivational/educational messages delivered via text help people in their efforts to quit smoking and may also support those who need to stick to their treatments and increase their activity levels. A lot of people are self-proclaimed “couch potatoes” but too much sitting time can be dangerous to our health. Turns out, it’s not enough to exercise more if we still sit for the same amount of time each day. Changing daily habits, using simple step counters and setting goals (eg. steps per day) can help people reduce the time they spend sitting. Virtual reality computer-based games and activities are fun, but they can also encourage physical activity. The latest research shows that Wii-based exercise programs can help older adults improve their balance. Making lifestyle changes for the good of our health is wise and can help us feel better, live longer and maintain mobility and independence as we age. But it isn’t always easy to get started or to stay motivated. A cool new gadget could be the answer, particularly when it comes to recording all the good things you do and seeing the steady progress you make. For many people, that goes a long way toward keeping up the momentum and sticking with the plan. Thinking about investing in a new tracker or monitoring device? Start by deciding what you want it for based on your goals, habits and preferences and taking into account your budget and technical “comfort level.” Some higher priced options are loaded with functions, but if you don’t use them – or you spend more time trying to figure them out than exercising – they may not be a good choice. Ultimately, the best fitness device for you is one you continue to use every day and one that supports you in your quest to live a healthy, active lifestyle.']"

Decision aids can help,"['Decisions, decisions… we make hundreds every day. Some are inconsequential; others are monumental with long lasting effects. Of all the decisions we make, among the most difficult are those that involve our health and medical care, particularly when we don’t really know enough about the options. Dr. Dawn Stacey is a scientist, nurse and the Scientific Director of the Ottawa Hospital’s Decision Aids Research Group. She and her colleagues are committed to helping people in those stressful situations by developing easy-to-use, accessible and unbiased “decision aids.” Where there is no clear best option, these tools – including pamphlets, videos and interactive internet-based programs – guide people through the process of making an informed decision that takes into account their individual needs, preferences and values. “Decision aids help people learn what options are available as well as the pros and cons of each,” says Dr. Stacey. “Patients are then better prepared to ask questions, play a more active role in their treatment and know what they can realistically expect in terms of benefits and possible side effects.” Decision aids go beyond regular health information material by encouraging people to examine the choices from a personal view, helping people “think about what\'s important to them, so they can give the doctor information that\'s relevant to their unique situations,"" explains Dr. Stacey. Some decision aids are used by people on their own when preparing for an appointment with a clinician (doctor, nurse or specialist). These decision aids may provide useful questions to discuss at an appointment or help people think of questions that are important to them (1). Briefer decision aids have been developed for the clinician and patient to use together during an appointment. They help focus the discussion on comparing the options and patients can share what is important to them. ""When we talk to people theywantto be involved [in healthcare decisions] but the system doesn\'t often allow for it. They get information at the doctors\' office and don\'t know what to say or ask in response. [Patient decision aids] give them a tool and structure."" Higher quality patient decision aids are based on the best available evidence on the health issue and present balanced information that is not biased. When used by the patient on their own, they are meant to supplement – not replace – consultations with doctors (2). Several individual studies support the use of decision aids for patients grappling with health decisions, includingcancer treatments(3; 4). But are they really helpful when it comes to making difficult health-related decisions? To answer that question, Dr. Stacey led a comprehensivesystematic reviewof 105randomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 31,000 participants who were making decisions regarding treatment or screening (1). The trials compared the use of patient decision aids to usual care alone in order to determine the impact of these tools when making tough health-related choices. The review found that patient decision aids improve people’s knowledge about available options, so patients can weigh the benefits against the risks and potential side effects (1). The results also showed that patient decision aids help people feel better informed and clearer about their personal values and priorities (1). Participants who used patient decision aids were also more likely to have more productive, meaningful communication with health care providers and to participate in decisions about their diagnosis and treatment – a factor that can lead to improved health and healthcare experiences (5). Dr. Stacey is encouraged by the review’s findings, but says there are still challenges to overcome before people can more fully benefit from patient decision aids – for example, encouraging doctors to support their use. Some health professionals can be resistant to using decision aids, she says, and ongoing awareness campaigns and clinician training/education can help dispel some of the common myths, such as “It takes too long!” and “Patients don’t want to be involved!” and “Doctor knows best” (6). For example, a public awareness campaign in the United Kingdom focused on informing the public that they have a right to be involved in decisions about their health, with the slogan “No decision about me without me” (7). If you’re facing a difficult decision about a potential treatment or procedure and can use some guidance, try searching theOttawa Hospital Research Institute’s online inventoryof decision aids. It includes more than 300 tools from around the world and is updated regularly. We\'ll soon be including the decision aids from this online inventory in the McMaster Optimal Aging Portal, so in the not-too-distant future you\'ll no longer need to go to a separate website. You\'ll be able to find relevant decision aids just by searching the Portal. If you can’t find the patient decision aid you’re looking for, Dr. Stacey recommends you use theOttawa Personal Decision Guidethat is helpful for any health or social decision. Or begin by writing down the following three key questions:1.What are my options?2.What are the benefits and harms of each option3.What are the chances of those occurring? These questions will help guide your conversation with your doctor or health care team to arrive at the best solution for you (8).']"

Death is peaceful. It's the transition that's troublesome.”â\x80\x95\xa0Isaac Asimov With both an aging population and an increase in treatment options to keep us living longer than ever before, it is time to rethink end-of-life care and communication (1, 2). When elderly people become ill, it can be challenging for healthcare professionals to recognize when a patient is ready for the transition from curative care (managing and treating illness) to palliative care. “It’s a complex issue,” says Dr. You, a clinician at the Hamilton General Hospital in Ontario, Canada and expert in end-of-life communication. For one thing, our healthcare system focuses on helping to cure or manage sickness. As Dr You points out, “Hospitals were designed with cure in mind, to make people better.” As a result, elderly patients may receive unnecessary treatments which emphasize cure when they would benefit from a palliative focus to maximize their comfort and quality of life in their last days (3). Our understanding of the transition from curative to palliative care has recently been enhanced, thanks to anextensive reviewby researchers in the United Kingdom who examined whether improving this transition could reduce hospital admissions and length of stay. This review used a variety of methods including: twosystematic reviews; surveys, focus groups and interviews with health professionals, patients and key decision-makers; and case review (3). Unfortunately, when it comes to navigating the transition to end-of-life care, both patients and their doctors may not recognize when the time is right. The results show that health professionals find it difficult to determine when a patient has entered the last 12 months of their life and even when they do, patients are often kept in the dark about their prognosis. None of the elderly patients interviewed had actually discussed their care preferences while in hospital. As a result, people are spending more time in hospital than they may need or prefer (3). The review also found that many health professionals adopt an “either/or” approach to curative or palliative care rather than  a blended approach: continuing to provide treatment options while enhancing comfort and preparing for end-of-life. The researchers reported that many health professionals believe older people are more likely to accept a terminal diagnosis, simply because they are elderly. This may not actually be the case for some patients (3). In fact, in Dr. You’s experience, “other patients are relieved to hear an honest assessment of their prognosis, and for many patients this can create a space for other important discussions to occur” about their goals and wishes for care at end of life. Although these results are based on the UK experience and may not apply to every healthcare system (or every healthcare team) they are worth considering, both for elderly patients and those who care for them. Dr. You agrees that end-of-life communication is challenging for many health professionals - being clear about a prognosis and offering options for both treatment and palliative care may not be easy to do in practice. For one thing, the nature of many chronic health conditions means that people can experience “ups and downs” in their health: for a while the treatment may be working well and all looks good, but then the patient’s health can take a turn for the worse. “Clinicians will often say it is a bit difficult to predict exactly where patients are in this cycle and what their prognosis is. Clinicians tend to be over-optimistic in their prognosis of survival, often by a lot… There is always one more treatment to try even when things look grim and dire.”As a result, “things can be pushed off quite late until there are no more options, literally often days before patients die. This can rob patients and families of precious time to make important decisions.” Also – and understandably – few people want to discuss death and dying, even clinicians.\xa0 Dr. You has found that when patients and families face serious illness, often emotions run high and it can be difficult for health professionals to discuss end-of-life decisions at the risk of destroying hope or making patients and families feel abandoned. Clinicians struggle to “know what words to say or how to start those conversations.” ACanadian research network– of which Dr. You is a member – aims to improve end-of-life communication between healthcare providers and patients and is working to develop tools to support end-of-life decision-making. As a first step, he also strongly encourages everyone to think about their values and “What kind of living is worth living for you” and share these values with family, caregivers and especially those who will be making decisions on your behalf. For example, Dr. You says he would be willing to go through a lot if at the end of the day he could recognize and interact with his family and loved ones and listen to music. This simple guidance can be very helpful if the need arises for others to make medical decisions on his behalf.\xa0 Be sure to revisit these conversations: “What I consider to be an acceptable quality of life at 42 might be very different when I’m 72.” Resources and tools to help guide your advance care planningwww.advancecareplanning.ca Access the free online Advance Care Planning Workbookwww.myspeakupplan.ca""]"

Advance care directives  or “living wills” are one way to make your personal wishes known about end-of-life care (2).\xa0 Dr. Howard points out that while writing down specific care decisions is a good idea, it can sometimes be difficult to understand the medical implications of these decisions (use of a feeding tube, for example) and people tend to change their minds in the reality of a new medical situation. The important thing is to clarify your values and general wishes for end-of-life care with those who might speak on your behalf (family, friends or caregivers). This is especially important as you get older because of the increased risk of developing diseases that may affect your ability to make decisions. You may be counting on your loved ones to make these important decisions for you, but – not only does this put them in a difficult and often stressful position – if you haven’t discussed it, they may not always make the choices you prefer. Research has shown that many family members are not able to accurately predict elderly patients’ treatment preferences (2). When a patient does not have an advanced care plan and becomes critically ill, they may receive unwanted intensive care treatments in hospital instead of other options such as palliative care. Concerns about this prompted researchers to conduct asystematic reviewof 22 studies to compare the number and length of ICU stays for critically ill patients with and without advance care plans or palliative care counseling (3). When it comes to advance care planning it is true that “a stitch in time saves nine.” When patients planned in advance, they were 37% less likely to enter the ICU. \xa0\xa0Palliative care counselling for patients already in the ICU also significantly reduced the length of time they stayed there (3). Procrastination is one of the main reasons people do not have an advance care plan (1). If you live in Canada, Dr. Howard recommends checking out the‘Speak Up’campaign for advance care planning (4). Taking time now to plan for the possibility of these events can save you and your family from unwanted stress (3). “Many people perceive it is going to be difficult”, says Dr. Howard, but the Speak Up resources have tips and tools to help ease the conversation. She encourages everyone to think now about who would speak for you if you couldn’t speak for yourself, to let them know what your values and wishes are and make sure they are comfortable with those decisions. “It’s never too soon to do it – and you can keep revisiting it over your life time” Diane is a retiree who provides caregiving support at a distance to her parents who are in their 90s.\xa0 She herself has a care plan, has chosen a Power of Attorney, discussed her plans with her children and has paid for and planned her funeral arrangements. Discussing end-of-life decisions with her parents, however “Is not as easy as I thought it would be… they don’t really want to talk about it.”\xa0 She gives a few reasons why advance care planning can be challenging: Fear it will change care “My father doesn’t want to ‘rock the boat’” she tells us.\xa0 He is concerned that if he or his wife indicate they do not want life saving measures, they will be less likely to receive quality care and necessary treatments now or if they are admitted to hospital. Family members may not be the best substitute decision-makers In Diane’s experience, it helped to choose a non-family member as a substitute decision-maker who – in an emergency – is less likely “to be talking with their heart or guilt”. Geographic distance from family can also make it harder to have conversations about care decisions or facilitate these decisions when necessary. Concern that care plans won’t be considered in an emergency “I question whether or not our wishes will be upheld at the hospital” She herself experienced this when her husband was placed on life support against her wishes after a heart attack. Ultimately, says Diane, the important thing is that “each person’s wishes are respected” during the care planning process and in making end-of-life decisions.

The beeping monitors, the barrage of questions from medical staff, the drug-induced wooziness and sleep deprivation, not to mention pain, possibly invasive treatments like a breathing tube and almost certainly concern for your survival – all of this can cause anyone to feel overwhelmed. The term ‘post-traumatic stress disorder’ or PTSD, was originally associated with war veterans. But this mental health problem can affect anyone exposed to a frightening, traumatic and/or life threatening episode (1) and a critical illness certainly falls into that category. In fact at least 10% – and as many as 60% – of patients discharged from an ICU suffer PTSD at some point (2;3). Symptoms can appear months after being hospitalized and may include recurring flashbacks, nightmares and a tendency to avoid situations that might bring back memories of the event (1). People with PTSD are often anxious and have trouble concentrating, sleeping, interacting with others and enjoying activities – all of which can severely affect their quality of life (1;4). To learn more about the relationship between critical illness and PTSD, including risk factors and potential treatments,a recent high qualitysystematic reviewandmeta analysiswas conducted (5). The 40 included studies measured PTSD symptoms among adults who had survived a critical illness. Symptoms were measured at least a month after patients had been discharged from the ICU. While there is no sure way to predict who might develop PTSD (age, gender and the severity of the illness did not appear to increase risk) a few ’red flags’ emerged from this review. For example, people who already have mental health issues such as depression or anxiety and patients who have scary memories after being in the ICU are at higher risk of developing PTSD after a critical illness (5). Being under heavy sedation is another factor (5). Patients who were sedated with benzodiazepines – a drug which can cause delirium and intensify delusions and hallucinations (6) – had more PTSD symptoms. Two of the studies focused on treatment involving the use of “ICU diaries” (7;8). Medical staff and/or family members use notebooks to write daily messages about the person’s status and any other relevant information, often accompanied by photos. The diaries are given to patients after they leave the hospital to help them understand what really happened (as opposed to what they dreamed/hallucinated) during their time in the ICU (9). Both of these studies, including a randomized controlled trial involving 352 people (7), found that the diaries appeared to reduce PTSD symptoms by a small but significant amount (7;8). So far, ICU diaries have been used primarily in Europe but plans are underway to introduce them to North American hospitals and measure their effectiveness (10) while continuing to explore other possible prevention and treatment options so that survivors of a critical illness may enjoy the best possible quality of life. http://www.icu-diary.org Delirium in the elderly patient undergoing elective and non-elective surgery Recognize and prevent delirium when in hospital Music can help ease your hospital stay']"
296,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/03/17/music-can-help-ease-your-hospital-stay,17 March 2016,Music can help ease your hospital stay,"['As William Congreve so perceptively wrote in 1695:Music has charms to soothe a savage breast…That helps to explain why listening to music has now become a recognized and respected tool in helping to heal the body and mind. The idea of using music to benefit patients is not new (apparently Florence Nightingale believed in its soothing charms) and by the mid 1940s music therapy was on the way to becoming an organized clinical profession (1;2). Programs varied in terms of type and delivery but the general goal was to calm and/or distract patients and make their hospital stays more bearable. Over the years research has consistently demonstrated the benefits and effectiveness of music for patients (3;4) yet it continues to be an underused tool and experts wonder if there’s still a general lack of awareness (5). Asystematic reviewof 21 studies (including 19 good qualityrandomized controlled trials) provides evidence of the impact of music therapy, specifically on cancer patients (6). The studies included more than 1,600 participants, ranging in age from eight to 57, who were in hospital and undergoing surgery. The study groups listened to music before and/or after surgery and were later interviewed to assess their levels of anxiety, depression, pain and fatigue. Their scores were compared with those in the control groups, who received the usual care, listened to white noise, or were given headphones but no music. So were they soothed? Yes! Music therapy helped to reduce anxiety, pain and depression by a moderate amount and appeared to also slightly lower fatigue (6). Those findings were backed up by evidence from multiplesystematic reviewsthat assessed the effects of listening to music on adults undergoing variouskinds ofsurgery, and those in theEmergency Department(5;7-8). Once again, music was shown to help reduce pain (5;7-8) and anxiety (5;7) and improve patient satisfaction (5). One review even found that it did not matter whether the music was presented before, during or after surgery–all were effective (5). It should be noted that there was no evidence that music listening shortened hospital stays. And there is no research yet on whether music listening helps to speed the healing of wounds or reduce infection rates, so clearly more research needs to be done! While there are general guidelines for the type and tempo of therapeutic music for alleviating pain and anxiety (1), evidence from two reviews suggests patients may benefit more when they are able to choose the music themselves (5;6). That makes sense – if you prefer to listen to a classical orchestra, an earful of classic rock won’t necessarily have the desired effect. Despite remarkable medical advancements surgery can be scary and time spent in hospital will likely be challenging. Music therapy is a safe, non-invasive and inexpensive complement to treatment (4). So, if it helps take the edge off, then by all means – play that funky (or classical, country, R&B…) music! Quitting smoking first can reduce your risk of complications Say no to alcohol']"
297,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2016/03/10/supporting-seniors-at-higher-risk-of-poor-nutrition,10 March 2016,Supporting seniors at higher risk of poor nutrition,"['Just like a car, our body works best when it is well maintained and receives the proper amount of quality fuel. Also like a car, the older our body gets the more likely it is to break down in some way or another. That’s why proper nutrition is so important and why older adults need to be particularly careful about including enough vitamins, minerals and other nutrients in their diet to fuel a healthy, active lifestyle in their senior years. But that’s easier said than done. Most people make poor food choices occasionally and some may not always eat well for various reasons. Most worrisome are the many people who are at serious risk of poor nutrition: they simply do not get enough of the nutrients necessary for good health. Older adults are especially vulnerable due to one or more factors including a lack of appetite or sense of taste, low income, isolation and physical disability (1). It’s a serious problem: approximately one third of Canadians aged 65 or older are at risk of having poor nutrition (1), which in turn puts them at greater risk of health problems like diabetes, hypertension and heart disease (2). To make matters worse, the support that is available – from community organizations to health care providers, hospitals, dietitians and doctors – often lacks the coordination, monitoring and training necessary to meet the needs of older adults who could use help (3, 4). The McMaster Health Forum – a leading hub for improving health through collective problem solving – prepared asummary of the latest high quality evidenceon the topic and shared this with a panel of 11 older adults in Ontario affected by the problem of nutritional risk among older adults. Thepanel shared their ideas and experienceson the issue and discussed options to address the situation. Programs and initiatives aimed at teaching people about healthy eating can have great benefits. For exampleoffering nutrition educationto older adults – face to face, by telephone or through the internet – can improve their health and well being (5). Delivering education and advice in groups (6) or through other media can also help older adults maintain better diets (7, 8).Boosting motivationthrough behavioural counselling (6) and financial rewards for healthier eating behaviour (9, 10) have also been successful in changing eating habits. When it comes to identifying and advocating for older adults who may be at risk of poor nutrition, dietitians, doctors, nurses, community health care workers and informal caregivers make up the “front line” team. As familiar and trusted care providers, they are able to provide necessary care (11) while offering advice and education on nutrition (14-17). They can also play a role inimproving awarenessof poor nutrition in care settings such as hospitals, nursing homes and residential facilities (12, 13). Major barriers to improving older adults’ nutrition are a lack of awareness among the general public and even in the health system about the importance of ensuring older adults are getting proper nutrition. Other obstacles include older adults’ distrust or difficulty understanding important nutritional information (18), and a lack of awareness of available resources for people at risk (17). The panel maintained that nutrition education and awareness programs may help older adults make wise food choices, provided the campaigns are designed to be easily understood, relevant and respectful of various groups and cultures. The panel members agreed that accessibility is key; initiatives need to focus onimproving access to food, not just access to information. Many older adults are socially isolated, distrustful of new information and/or unwilling to change long held behaviours. Therefore, a priority is finding better ways toidentify people who may be at nutritional riskso they can receive the help and support they need. This will require the proactive involvement of doctors, nurses and other health care providers, some of whom may need specialized training themselves in order to be able to pass on accurate information about diet and nutrition. But it shouldn’t stop there. Members of the panel believe thateveryone has a responsibilityto protect the health and well-being of older adults by reporting or referring family members, friends or neighbours who they believe to be at risk. \xa0While such referrals may be in the best interests of older adults, they also could be seen as a breach of their privacy and right to make their own decisions. The panel members stressed the need to carefully consider whether referrals are justified and that the benefits of intervening outweigh any potentially damaging consequences.

For instance, take hormone therapy– or rather don’t! – at least not until you have all the latest facts based on current research evidence. Hormone therapy for menopausal women involves taking prescribed doses of estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progesterone to help replace levels which typically lower during menopause (1). This helps ease symptoms associated with menopause, such as itchy and/or dry skin and the dreaded hot flashes and night sweats (1). Remember the TV ad with the woman trudging out to the backyard in the midst of a snowstorm to uncover the air conditioner? Not so funny to those who can relate to her anguish! Hormone therapy was also believed to help protect against some serious age-related conditions including heart disease (2). Since women’s risk for heart attack and stroke increases after menopause (2) it seems like good timing to use hormones to ward off both menopause symptoms and heart problems. Can’t hurt, right? Well as it turns out, it can. In the past 10-15 years, a few large-scale studies have focused on the impact of hormone therapy, including one as part of the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term U.S. based health study (3). The results of thatrandomized controlled trialchallenged long-held assumptions, showing that not only was there no evidence of any protective benefits of hormone therapy for heart health, it can actuallyincreasethe risk of heart disease for some women (3). Since then, many more studies have been conducted in an effort to either confirm or refute those game-changing findings (4).\xa0A 2015 update of a previoussystematic reviewincluded the results of six new studies for a total of 19 high qualityrandomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 40,400 postmenopausal women (2). About half were prescribed hormone therapy – either estrogen alone or estrogen combined with progesterone – and compared with those incontrol groupswho were given either no treatments or a placebo. The review found that hormone therapy did not lower the risk of death from heart disease for postmenopausal women. There was evidence that hormone therapy increased the risk of stroke, clots in the arms or legs (venous thromboembolism) and clots in the lungs (pulmonary embolism) by a small degree (2). For example, the increased risk of stroke was 6 per 1000 women – in other words, 165 women would be treated before an additional stroke occurred. Additionally, a new systematic review from 2017 which evaluated 22 randomized controlled trials found that combination hormone therapy increased the risk of heart attack to between 3 and 7 per 1000 people and the risk of blood clots to between 4 and 11 per 1000. Risks of stroke, breast cancer, gallbladder disease, and death from lung cancer all increased with use of combination hormone therapy (5). Does this mean all women should avoid hormone therapy? Not necessarily. For some, the benefits (relief from menopause symptoms) may outweigh the risks, especially as risk varies depending on age, general health, the amount of time since menopause, and other health/lifestyle factors (2). In fact, younger women and those who had more recently gone through menopause showed a slightly lower risk of dying and of heart disease when they used hormone therapy. They still faced increased risk of clots and stroke, however. For the time being, it is not recommended that anyone take hormone therapy solely to prevent heart disease. Studies like these underline the importance of working with your doctor and having up-to-date, complete and accurate information – including any side effects or potential harms – before starting any new medication, therapy or procedure.

Options to improve support for unpaid caregivers,"['Imagine you’re offered a new job that you aren’t really qualified or trained to do. The hours are long and you’re on call 24/7. The work is demanding, you won’t get paid and to top it off, people will be counting on you to perform your duties week in, week out – no matter how stressful the work, how old you are, what condition you’re in, or even if you already have a job. Do you accept the offer? “No way,” is your likely response, but this situation is a reality for millions of unpaid caregivers. Eighty per cent of older adults and people with long-term health issues are cared for at home by family or friends, and the numbers will continue to climb as the proportion of older adults continues to rise (2). These caregivers play a vital role and take a huge weight off our healthcare system (3). Caregiving can be a rewarding experience which many people are happy to provide for their loved ones. But the role also involves many challenges and costs to the health, wellbeing and financial security of caregivers – often to the point where they end up needing care or treatment themselves (3). Recently, the conditions of unpaid caregivers have sparked a discussion on how we can better support them. The McMaster Health Forum – a leading hub for improving health through collective problem solving – prepared asummary of the latest high quality evidenceon the topic and shared this with a panel of 10 caregivers living in Ontario. Thepanel shared their ideas and experiences about caregivingand discussed options to address the issues they face. The latest evidence highlights three areas that could improve circumstances for unpaid caregivers: 1. Financial security:Like everyone else, unpaid caregivers need to earn a living or have access to adequate funds. They may have to take time off from their jobs or even quit working completely, resulting in additional stress as they struggle to cope financially (1;6). Some solutions include better public income (4) and housing support (5), or promoting a workplace culture that encourages flexible work arrangements for caregivers (3). 2. Engagement and support:The discouragement that unpaid caregivers often experience comes from believing they have to “go it alone.” Their contributions and insights are rarely acknowledged and, in fact, certain decisions regarding programs and services have done more harm than good for some families (6). Offering support groups, handbooks, toolkits, communication training, and other resources – in person or online – can ease the burden, build confidence and encourage the development of valuable knowledge and skills (7-13). Combining more than one support strategy can even delay the need for caregivers to move their loved ones into assisted-living facility (14). 3. Tailored training for those caring for people with complex conditions:Many older adults have complex health issues like dementia or more than one chronic health condition (multimorbidity) which can present new challenges for unpaid caregivers, many of whom benefit from specialized education and training to successfully provide care in these situations (9). More support and targeted training for caregivers of people with complex conditions may be good first steps. Case managers or other support workers can also help connect caregivers to services available in their communities (15). Caring for loved ones with long-term – often complex – health issues brings value to both those receiving and giving care. But it is also challenging and worries about money and financial security only add to the stress.The panel members agreed thatgovernment-funded assistancewould at least ensure caregivers aren’t worse off financially. Meanwhileeducation, training and easy access to ongoing resources and supportare key to helping caregivers feel confident and capable. That’s particularly important for those caring for older adults with chronic, complex conditions. Caregivers also want and deserve to be anactive and valued part of a coordinated careteam that includes medical/health professionals and support service providers. The panelists recognize that progress has been delayed by barriers including lack of access to family doctors and not enough financial assistance from the government. Changing health systems and government policies is only part of the solution, however, and one that we cannot rely on. Caregivers also voiced the need torally community support for unpaid caregivers. They believe more public education and dialogue will bring greater attention to the importance of their role and their needs.

In an emergency just call 911!,"['Taking your time is the smart way to go in many instances. But a medical emergency like a stroke is NOT one of them. In fact, that’s when it’s critical to act quickly and without hesitation. Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of disability worldwide (1;2;3). That’s alarming but there is encouraging news: advances in the diagnosis, treatment and aftercare of acute ischaemic stroke (the most common kind that happens when a clot stops blood from getting to a part of the brain) have saved countless lives (4). A turning point in emergency care for ischemic stroke came with the introduction of “clot busting” treatment called thrombolysis in which the drug tPA (Tissue Plasminogen Activator) is injected to dissolve the clot and restore blood flow (5). It works well but there is a catch: the drug must be given as quickly as possible (ideally within 3 hours) after the appearance of stroke symptoms in order to save the patient from serious brain damage, or even death (6). Designated stroke centres have become the new standard of care in many countries (3). They provide coordinated prevention, acute care, rehabilitation and continuing care services delivered by a medical team of specialists and are considered by many experts to be the best option for stroke patients (3;4;6). That’s why people suffering a stroke may be taken by ambulance to a specialist stroke centre, even if it’s farther away than the patient’s local hospital. That would seem to be at odds with the goal of having stroke victims treated as soon as possible so a recentsystematic reviewattempted to find out whether emergency care in specialized stroke centres does indeed save more lives (7). Fourteen studies were included in the review. They compared death rates for 2,790 stroke patients, some of whom were taken directly to a designated stroke centre while others received emergency treatment at a local hospital. Although there were not many high quality studies available on this topic to allow strong conclusions, the best evidence we have right now shows that it is the clot busting treatment that matters, not the location. Death rates were no different between the two groups when the patient’s local hospital provided thrombolysis, and both sets of patients experienced about the same rate of recovery and risk of complications (7). In other words, your local hospital may be just as good as a stroke centre in an emergency, provided it is equipped to deliver thrombolysis. Patients can later be transferred to a stroke centre for recovery and rehabilitation with specialized and coordinated medical care – as was the case for this study’s participants. More high quality research will allow us to make more confident recommendations about emergency stroke care in the future. In the meantime, if you think you may be having a stroke, or you suspect someone else is, don’t waste time wondering where to go – call 911 and leave it to the emergency personnel to get you to the right place as quickly as possible.

Take steps to support healthy aging,"['Do you remember being implored as a child to“please sit quietly”and finding it almost impossible to do? How much better we got at it as we grew older! Well, it turns out this is one skill we shouldn’t be practicing to perfection. Studies show that too many of us spend too much time being “sedentary”—sitting or lying down and expending very little energy (1;2). In fact, most Canadians spend at least half our waking hours sitting (2). That includes the hours we spend commuting, at work and during our leisure time (watching television and computer screens, reading, dining). Too much time spent sitting can increase our risk for heart attacks, strokes, type 2 diabetes, depression and other mental health concerns, and cancer (3-5). What’s more, even adults who exercise for the minimum recommended 150 minutes a week are still at risk of poor health if they regularly sit for long stretches of time (5). That may come as a surprise to people who think that as long as they’re getting some regular exercise, it doesn’t matter what they do—or don’t do—the rest of the time. Onesystematic reviewmeasured the effectiveness of programs aimed at reducing adults’ sedentary time and the impact on health risks (6). The review included 34randomized controlled trialsand involved more than 5,800 participants who took part in various programs focusing on promoting physical activity, reducing sedentary time, changing lifestyle behaviours, or combinations of those approaches. Studies ranged in length from three to six months and compared changes in sedentary time (self-reported or measured using devices such as step counters) between those involved in a program to those in acontrol group. So , just what did this review find? Programs and supports to reduce sedentary time do work—at least in the short term. Programs that focused on decreasing sitting time or changing lifestyle behaviours reduced sedentary time by 42 minutes and 24 minutes a day respectively, although these benefits did not last in the long term (6).Another reviewusing similar programs supported these results—finding that such programs may lead to a reduction in sedentary time of up to nearly an hour every day (7). Interestingly, programs focused solely on promoting exercise resulted in little or no change (6). In other words, we need to think about sitting less – not just exercising more – to change our sedentary behaviour. Devices that measure steps and activity may help you make these changes. Evidence fromanothersystematic review, including 15randomized controlled trialsand over 3200 participants (8) found that step counters such as pedometers or accelerometers help to reduce sedentary time a small but significant amount (participants spent on average 23 minutes less a day being sedentary). However, a smaller but morerecentsystematic reviewfound that accelerometers, but not pedometers are beneficial (9). Why the difference? Well, the review’s authors noted that the ability of accelerometers to more accurately detect steps could be a factor (9). The research also suggests that setting a goal—for example 10,000 steps a day—helps reduce sedentary time even more, particularly if the goal is customized to the needs and abilities of the individual (6). A few tips to reduce sitting time include taking frequent breaks from your desk or couch to move about; walking around while talking on the phone; and cleaning, exercising or doing activities while watching television (10). Monitor your own daily habits and if you find you’re sitting too long and too often, then for your own good –get up and get moving!

So far, no effective medication has been found to prevent the progress of cognitive impairment and onset of dementia (1). That’s why there’s so much interest in lifestyle approaches for prevention or treatment. Many people want to know, “What can I do to keep my brain healthy and functioning well?” Regular physical exercise is a great way to promote good health throughout life. Recent long-term studies of aging show that people who are more active have less risk of chronic disease, disability or depression, and are more likely to keep up their activities of daily living (ADL) (2;3). Not to mention the benefits of exercise for preventing falls (4;5), fitness and quality of life for older adults (6;7). Exercise helps us feel better, and enjoy a healthier, more active lifestyle for a longer period of time. Exercise also has few side effects and can be inexpensive and enjoyable! But does it help prevent – or at least slow – cognitive impairment and improve life for people with dementia? Asystematic reviewwhich included 17randomized controlled trialsmeasured the impacts of various types of exercise on 1,067 older adults already diagnosed with dementia (8). The review found promising evidence that exercise may help people with dementia improve their activities of daily living – for example bathing, dressing, eating – which can help people facing cognitive decline to maintain their independence (8;9;10). This is a particularly interesting and important finding since people with cognitive impairment often find it more difficult to perform activities of daily living. It is also possible that certain types of exercise – and how often or intensely we do them – may benefit brain health and function more than others. Tai Chi, for example, may be a promising way to help protect, and even enhance, cognitive function among healthy adults as reported in another recent systematic review. The authors of this review go on to say it may also be possible that some people may benefit more from exercise, depending on their age, level of fitness, cognitive health, and severity or type of dementia diagnosis (11). More high quality studies are needed to learn more about the long-term benefits of exercise for brain health and cognitive function, but the most recent evidence is promising (9)! No matter what the research says about the impact on cognition, there are already enough compelling reasons to exercise that the decision to embrace physical activity is a “no-brainer!”']"

It’s a painful and often frustrating chronic condition that causes inflammation of the small joints – typically in the hands and feet – resulting in stiffness and swelling that can eventually wear down the bones and cause the joints to become deformed (1). Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease, meaning that it occurs when a person’s immune system mistakenly attacks their own tissue. There is no cure so treatment involves controlling symptoms and preventing damage to the joints with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Methotrexate is one such drug, commonly prescribed to rheumatoid arthritis sufferers (1). Within the past decade a new class of drug was developed for people who were no longer getting relief from traditional DMARDs. “Biologics” work by suppressing triggers in the immune system that cause inflammation. There are several types of biologic drugs, for example etanercept, adalimumab and rituximab. Numerous studies have shown that biologics help to prevent joint erosion and provide relief for arthritis symptoms (3) – so many in fact that acomprehensive reviewconducted in 2013 was updated just a year later to incorporate even more recent evidence (4).The 2014 review included results from 108 studies involving participants who had rheumatoid arthritis or were at high risk of developing the condition. The studies included a variety of biologic drugs. Study participants were given biologics alone, methotrexate (or another ‘traditional’ DMARD) alone, or a combination of both and were assessed after at least six months of treatment. What was the verdict? Consistent with prior studies, biologics were found to be effective in reducing pain and inflammation, with the greatest improvement resulting from a combination of both biologics and traditional DMARDs. But that seemingly strong vote of confidence for biologics comes with a cautionary note: the report did not address the safety of the medications. As these drugs alter the immune system, there continues to be considerable debate in the medical community over whether biologics can increase the risk of serious infections, such as tuberculosis.\xa0 A comprehensive 2015systematic reviewon the topic (including 106randomized controlled trialsand over 42,000 patients) found there was no noticeable increase in the number of serious infections for people taking low doses of biologic drugs, but the risk was greater at standard and high doses (5). So should people avoid biologic drugs after all? As with most drugs and procedures, their benefits need to be weighed against the risks, which are different for everyone. Patients’ age, medical history, overall health, the stage/severity of the condition, as well as their own values and preferences will help doctors determine if adding biologic drugs to their treatment plans is advisable, and if so, the optimal dosage.']"

What are the best ways to diagnose dementia?","['As the number of people withcognitive impairmentand dementia continues to grow at an alarming rate, medical and scientific communities worldwide are seeking ways to help those affected, their families and our communities adapt to best manage the effects of cognitive diseases (1). New drugs and treatments are continually being developed and we have considerably more knowledge about the causes, effects and progress of Alzheimer’s and other dementias. But for now – and for the foreseeable future – there is no cure. Nonetheless, early diagnosis of dementia is considered important and beneficial for several reasons (2): The next question is: what is the best way to do this? The answer isn’t easy or obvious and is further complicated by the nature of the disease itself. People with dementia often aren’t aware they have a memory problem – or are in denial – so are not likely to mention it to their doctors. And even if they do, health care providers may believe symptoms are simply normal signs of aging (2). A recentsystematic reviewof 13 studies (including 4randomized controlled trials) is considered the first to measure the number – and accuracy – of dementia diagnoses that resulted from a wide variety of dementia detection approaches, including screening at memory clinics, regularly scheduled home visits by geriatric nurses, widespread distribution of information pamphlets, and physician education programs to help doctors better recognize the early stage symptoms of dementia (3). The studies varied widely in terms of their scope and scale, the number of participants, the duration of the trials and the quality of the evidence. After being educated about the disease, its symptoms and testing methods, doctors were more likely to suspect dementia in a higher proportion of patients, but not always accurately. In fact, more education did not reliably help doctors determine which patients actually did have dementia or diagnose them any earlier. There was evidence from individual studies that screening at memory clinics and regular home visits by a geriatric nurse may be useful ways to identify patients with dementia earlier. Distributing education leaflets about dementia did not appear to help increase diagnosis rates (3). Further research is strongly recommended to strengthen the findings and to address important issues not covered in this review – notably, the cost effectiveness of the various approaches and screening options. Also important to keep in mind (and noted by the review authors) is that even an accurate diagnosis might not change people’s behaviour or decisions about treatment, support or planning for the future (3,4). However, often concerns about memory problems (by the individual or their families) are the reason people seek screening for dementia, so providing a diagnosis to address these concerns is worthwhile.

Ultrasound an easier way to detect bladder obstructions,"['Lower urinary tract symptoms are common, especially in older men (1). These annoying and sometimes painful symptoms include difficulty urinating, urinating too frequently, and having to get up many times at night to urinate (2). Symptoms are often caused by a bladder outlet obstruction – a blockage that slows or stops the flow of urine from the bladder (3). One of the most common causes of an obstruction is an enlarged prostate (a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia) which can often be treated effectively with medication.Click here for information about drug treatments.  However, there are other reasons why men may have lower urinary tract symptoms (including an infection, side effects of medications or chronic health issues such as Parkinson’s) and other serious causes of an obstruction (including bladder stones or cancer). Left untreated an obstruction can result in serious problems such as recurring urinary tract infections and even kidney damage (3). Since the causes vary and the consequences can be serious, it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis and identify the best treatment – but that’s when things become uncomfortable. The traditional test is rather invasive: a urologist inserts a small tube (catheter) into the bladder through the penis, and the bladder is filled with a saline solution to measure volume and pressure. Hoping for a simpler way, researchers conducted studies to see whether obstructions could be accurately detected by asking patients to answer a series of questions about their symptoms. A recentsystematic reviewincluded 10 such studies, involving more than 1,200 older adult men (4). The participants completed a commonly used questionnaire called the International Prostate Symptom Score that collects information on specific lower urinary tract symptoms (5). The review also included 20 studies involving almost 1400 men in which bladder scans were used to measure urine volume (4). The scans were done with an ultrasound, which is non-invasive and not painful. \xa0For both sets of studies, the accuracy of the diagnoses using the “kinder, gentler” methods was assessed and compared with the traditional procedure. So will completing a questionnaire be enough to tell whether you have a bladder outlet obstruction? Regrettably, no. But on the bright side, bladder scans appear to be a viable alternative to bladder catheters as there was strong evidence that they measure urine volume with the same accuracy. That’s good news for patients and their doctors as it means an easier, more comfortable procedure may be used for diagnosing bladder outlet obstructions and determining the appropriate treatments.']"

But like many other things we take for granted when we’re young (strength, endurance, bone density, a full head of hair...) our sense of balance declines as we age. That’s one reason why older adults are at greater risk of falling and potentially becoming seriously hurt or even dying as a result (1). Past research has shown that regular physical activity can help prevent falls, particularly when it includes exercises and movements designed to improve balance (2;3). Tai Chi for example, is recommended for its various benefits, including improving strength and balance through slow, controlled movements (4;5). But if Tai Chi isn’t for you, there are other options you many want to consider.Onesystematic reviewof 15randomized controlled trialsmeasured the benefits of Pilates (6), a mind-body exercise that has been popular since the early 20th century. Like Tai Chi, it involves controlled movements and concentrates on flexibility, strength, posture and breathing (7). Each study included in the review revolved around older adult participants who took part in group Pilates sessions. The exercises varied (mat exercises as well as exercises using elastic bands, foam rollers, balls, or other equipment), and generally involved 60 minute Pilates sessions done 2-3 times a week. The study participants were either compared to folks who kept up with their usual daily activities but did not take Pilates, or folks doing task-oriented trainings such as yoga, stretching, aerobic exercises, and more (6). Another emerging form of balance training that is gaining attention for its novel approach is “perturbation-based balance training” or balance recovery training. It focuses on improving people’s reaction time and helping them better recover from a loss of balance. Training can include equipment (such as moving platforms), or manual interference (such as nudges by a therapist) to enhance your ability to react and stop yourself from falling. Asystematic reviewof eightrandomized controlled trialsexamined whether perturbation-based balance training lowers the risk for falls in older adults as well as people with neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s disease. More than 400 people between the ages of 50 and 98 took part in perturbation-based balance training and were compared with those incontrol groupswho participated in other types of balance enhancing exercises (8). Both Pilates and perturbation-based balance training appear to be promising strategies (6;8)! The review on Pilates suggests that compared to doing basic daily activities, Pilates may help older adults improve their dynamic balance (staying balanced while moving around or changing positions), as well as their static balance and stability (staying balanced when in an upright position or when doing things without moving your feet). The findings also support the idea that Pilates training may be better than other task-oriented trainings at improving overall balance, however more research is needed before we can say whether Pilates may help to reduce one’s chance of falling (6). Another important thing to note is that although Pilates was conducted in group sessions within most of the research studies, this form of exercise can also be done from the comfort of your own home. This is super handy during times when accessing in-person classes is not feasible or appropriate, like during a quarantine and when policies around physical distancing are in place. For example, instructor-led online Pilates classes and videos are great ways to still engage in this form of exercise remotely, while also benefiting from some professional tips and guidance. Remember to start slow and take it easy if you are a beginner. So far the evidence on perturbation-based balance training is also encouraging: participants completing the training reported fewer falls and were less likely to fall, compared with those in thecontrol groups. Further research is needed but there is cautious optimism that this approach may help people react and recover their balance more quickly so that a slip or trip doesn’t necessarily have to end in a fall (8). This type of training uses specialized equipment and help from a trained physical therapist, so it may be worth keeping in mind for when you are able to access services in-person. Not sure which balance training exercises are best for you? Consider asking your physical therapist for guidance on where to start, but expect longer response times in instances such as the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, be aware of hazards and take the necessary precautions (e.g. good lighting, clear pathways, secure handrails etc.) so that you remain surefooted and safe as you enjoy an active lifestyle (9).']"

Have you had your flu shot yet?,"['We’ve no sooner put away the lawn furniture and dug out the sweaters when we’re bombarded once again with radio and TV ads, signs and displays at every mall and pharmacy asking the same question... “Have you had your flu shot?” \xa0Yes, flu season is here and it’s time to get the shot! Influenza (aka ‘the flu’) generally makes its appearance a month or two before the holidays and hangs around through the winter. But unlike other seasonal traditions, this one does not spread joy and good cheer – but rather germs and misery. The annual vaccine remains the best way to avoid getting the flu (1) and suffering the miserable symptoms that go along with it, not to mention more serious consequences such as pneumonia, hospitalization and even death (2;3). It is estimated that there are 3 to 5 million cases of severe influenza illness worldwide and approximately 250,000 to 500,000 deaths every year (3). While the flu affects everyone, older adults whose immune systems naturally weaken with age are especially vulnerable. Influenza is transmitted from person to person, through coughing, sneezing, hand to hand contact with subsequent touching (auto-inoculation) of the nose (3).\xa0Seniors living in long term care facilities are particularly susceptible: not only do they have weakened immune systems, they’re also a “captive market” for viruses spread by other residents, visitors and staff. As a result, there are significantly higher rates of influenza related hospitalizations and death among older adults living in long term care (4). Canadian targets aim for 80% of older adults to get the flu shot to help prevent the spread of infection. Yet every year at least 30% of older adults in Canada – including those in nursing homes and other long term care facilities – are not vaccinated (5). Access, convenience, encouragement and cost are among the factors that affect vaccination decisions (6). The purpose ofonesystematic reviewwas to summarize the results from only high quality studies to accurately determine whether getting the flu shot helps lower the risk of pneumonia and death in older adults living in long term care. The review included 11 studies with a total of 11,262 participants. Some received the flu vaccine while others didn’t; three or more months later the researchers measured the number of cases of flu, pneumonia, hospitalization and death (7). The flu shot was found to lower the risk of serious consequences due to flu infections – including pneumonia and death – and is strongly recommended for older adults living in long term care facilities (7). Another high quality systematic review showed that the flu vaccine even protects when not well-matched to that season’s circulating strain (8). Additionally, an even more recentsystematic reviewfound that older adults who received the flu vaccine may experience less influenza and influenza-like-illness over that season (9), so - as they say - it’s worth a shot! The evidence and arguments for getting the flu shot are strong and compelling, particularly for older adults. Older adults are vulnerable enough to diseases and chronic conditions (dementia, arthritis, etc.) over which they have little control. The flu is one illness we have a fighting chance of beating – assuming we get the shot! If you are a senior, protect yourself from infection. Whether you are living in your own home, with family, in a retirement community or in a long term care facility, the flu shot can help you stay healthy through the winter and make sure no unwanted guests – like flu viruses – ruin your holiday plans.']"

Whether it’s a stream of negative stories in the news, personal or health problems impacting ourselves or our loved ones, at times we can justifiably feel sad, worried or anxious. Those feelings differ from what we feel when depressed. Depression is a mood disorder that affects how we feel, think and behave. Symptoms include a pervasive feeling of sadness, losing interest in things that were once considered important and/or enjoyable and having trouble thinking or concentrating (1). Depression can affect our emotions, physical health, relationships and work life. It’s a common and serious health issue: according to a recent community health survey in Canada, almost one in 9 adults experience symptoms of depression during their lifetime (2).\xa0 Some experts predict depressive disorders will become one of the leading causes of burden of disease (measuring the total impact of the disease, including costs, deaths and illness) worldwide by 2030 (3). Those with more severe symptoms and/or with more complex forms of the disease (e.g. bipolar disorder) are often referred to specialists but most people seeking help for depression begin by talking to their family doctor or other primary care health professional. Two recentsystematic reviewsfocused specifically on treatments for depression prescribed by family doctors, with the aim of finding out whether they help to relieve depression symptoms. Antidepressants continue to be the most widely prescribed treatment for depression (1), soone of the research reviewsexamined commonly used drugs in this category (4). These included “tricyclic and tetracyclic” antidepressants (TCAs), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and St. John’s Wort, an herb that is available without a prescription, as well as other types of drugs. The review included 66randomized controlled trialsand more than 15,000 participants aged 37 to 78. People in the study groups were treated for six to 12 weeks after which their depression “scores” were compared to thecontrol groupwho were given aplacebo. For people who don’t want to take medication, another option is psychological treatments. That was the focus of thesecond reviewwhich included 30randomized controlled trialswith more than 5,000 participants aged 30 to 81 (5). The study groups received six to 16 weeks of treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy which seeks to change people’s inaccurate or negative thinking patterns. Other treatments included problem-solving therapy, interpersonal therapy, education or counselling. Treatments included individual “face-to-face” sessions with a therapist as well as telephone or computer-based interactions and education. What the research tells us Both strategies – certain types of antidepressants and psychological therapy treatments – were found to be more effective in the short term at reducing symptoms of depression, compared with a placebo or no treatment. TCAs, SSRIs and St. John’s Wort all appear to be equally effective, although there was not enough information about the effects when taking these drugs for more than 12 weeks and for some negative side effects from taking these drugs were worse than not receiving any treatment.St. John’s wort can interact with other medications(6), so it is important to always ask your doctor before trying this option. Of the various psychological treatments, cognitive behavioural therapy appeared to be most effective at improving symptoms of depression. Interestingly, patients benefited even if there was minimal physical contact with the therapist (e.g. sessions were conducted via phone or computer). And there is no need to choose one approach or the other: other studies show that psychological treatments can offer added benefit for people who are also prescribed medication, reducing depression symptoms more than with drug treatment alone (7,8). Further research is needed to better determine the long-term benefits of both drug and psychological treatments. Meanwhile, if you recognize the early signs of depression in yourself or a loved one, don’t ignore them. Talk to your doctor and find out about treatment options that can reduce symptoms and potentially prevent a more serious problem. Mindfulness-based therapy can also prevent relapses for people with depression.Click here to read more.']"

If you suffer an accident or have a sudden, serious health issue the hospital’s emergency department is your immediate recourse. There you can be examined, treated and advised what to do (or not do) to get well. Then what? Often, subsequent care and treatment involves a hospital stay and that’s where things can get frustrating. In many communities hospitals are operating over capacity, staff are overworked and beds are in short supply (1) which means many patients have to wait for care (2), leading to impatience, worry, discomfort, not to mention the potential for contracting viruses or infections (3). Often you just want to go home where you’re convinced you can recuperate more comfortably and effectively. According to the research, you may be right. Various types of home care services and supports may be available to provide the follow-up medical care you need, depending on the country, city or community in which you live. Arecent reviewof 22 studies (including 10randomized controlled trials) examining “Hospital in the Home” services followed the care of thousands of patients who visited the ER in 5 different countries (in Australia and Europe). The most common health issues that brought patients to the ER were respiratory infections, COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), bacterial skin infection (cellulitis) and deep vein thrombosis. The home care patients went home directly after receiving initial treatment in the emergency department and received individualized care by nurses as well as other health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, social workers and dieticians (5). As might be expected, more people were satisfied when they received at-home care compared with people who were admitted to hospital, which is consistent with other studies which demonstrate a strong preference for “hospital in the home” over hospital-based treatment (6). Importantly, there appeared to be no significant difference in health outcomes, including adverse reactions (for example, to new medications), complications, safety issues and patient death (5). In other words, people who went home to recuperate and receive treatment as needed were not putting themselves at greater health risk than if they stayed in the hospital. Ninety-one year old Lillian has received care both in hospital and at home. In her opinion, home is the preferred option for a few reasons: People in hospital may hesitate to ask for help when they need it Home can help us feel more comfortable and less like a ‘patient’ Lillian notes that sometimes care in the home may not be optimal such as: In Lillian’s view, it is important for health care providers to work with families to make decisions about home care.

Studies show it is better and easier to prevent weight gain than it is to try and lose weight and successfully keep it off (1). However, with North American adults typically gaining an average of 0.5 kg a year (2), it may be easier said than done. So, what are the best ways to maintain a steady, healthy weight?Asystematic reviewwas conducted to answer that question. The review included 22 studies, involving more than 480,000 participants, and examined whether changes in diet, exercise or lifestyle (or a combination of all three) worked best to keep people from gaining weight. The body mass index (BMI), weight and/or waist measurements of all participants were recorded before and after the study. The results were compared between those in the study groups and those incontrol groupswho received only usual care and attention (3). While there doesn’t appear to be any one recommended strategy for avoiding weight gain, there was evidence that choosing a low fat diet, eating more fruits and vegetables, and getting encouragement through support groups and/or text messages may help. Participants who monitored their heart rate during exercise to reach fitness targets were also more likely to avoid weight gain. Interestingly, there was not as much difference in weight gain as the researchers expected between the study groups and thecontrol groups, even though the control group participants weren’t involved in any of the diet, exercise or lifestyle programs, and received no special support or information. They were, however, weighed at the start of the study and knew that their weight measurements would be recorded again, leading the review authors to wonder if that alone motivated them to keep their weight under control (3). In terms of that harder to achieve weight loss, a more recentsystematic reviewlooked at the impact of internet-delivered weight loss programs with personalized feedback –such as feedback on performance, information about consequences, and goal setting– in overweight or obese adults. The results showed that people who participated in these types of programs experienced more weight loss at 3 and 6 months than people who did not receive personalized feedback. More research is needed to discover the long-term effects of these programs (4). When it comes to something as important as reaching and maintaining a healthy weight, you need to do what’s right for you. If, like many people, you need the structure and accountability of regular weigh-ins, include them as part of your personal weight management routine.']"

The right kinds of exercise can bring pain relief and improve balance,"['As we age there’s a tendency to become less physically active for a number of reasons, not the least of which is – it hurts! Arthritis continues to be a painful problem for many older adults and the most common form – osteoarthritis - is particularly troublesome. This condition occurs when the cartilage in joints wears down. Without the cushioning cartilage provides, our joints – particularly our knees – can become damaged resulting in pain, stiffness, tenderness and a loss of flexibility and balance. Serious injuries and death resulting from falls are prevalent in older adults and are reported to be on the rise (1) and there is some evidence that gait and balance problems associated with knee osteoarthritis further increase the risk of falling (2). What’s the remedy? Pain relievers and anti-inflammatory drugs are widely used but a proven treatment for knee osteoarthritis is actually exercise (3;4). Physical therapy and various forms of exercise have long been thought to benefit people suffering from osteoarthritis by helping to ease pain, reduce disability, increase confidence, improve mental health,\xa0and increase strength, flexibility, and balance (3;4;5). However, pinpointing which exercises are most appropriate and effective, and designing optimal exercise programs have proven to be challenging. Asystematic reviewpublished in 2014 sought to address these issues by analyzing the results of 48randomized controlled trialsinvolving more than 4,000 people aged 52 to 74 with knee osteoarthritis (6). Three categories of exercises were assessed: aerobic (such as walking and swimming); resistance (use of weights, exercise machines or elastic exercise bands) and performance (including movements targeting the lower legs). The studies also attempted to determine whether it was best to focus on one type of exercise versus a combination, as well as how often exercises should be done for best results. Pain “scores” and other measurements were used to record pain and disability levels before and after exercising, which were compared to those in the control groups. Exercise can help reduce pain and disability in people with osteoarthritis. The three categories of exercise appeared to be equally effective, however the evidence suggests that focusing on just one type (versus mixing it up) may provide the best result. Ideally, exercises should be supervised and performed at least three times a week (6). These results are backed up by evidence from two newer systematic reviews. The firstreviewaimed to determine whether exercise helps older adults with knee osteoarthritis improve balance and in turn, reduce their risk of falls. Once again participants (close to 1,500) engaged in various types of physical activity including aerobic exercise, strength training and tai chi. All were found to contribute to at least “medium improvement” in terms of enhancing balance and protecting against falls (7). Meanwhile, the secondreviewfound that not only can exercise slightly improve pain in people with chronic hip, knee, or hip and knee osteoarthritis, it can improve physical function as well (5). It’s another strong argument for making regular exercise part of your lifestyle to help avoid pain, falls and injury. If you’re experiencing knee pain and other problems, don’t assume your exercising days are behind you. Consult with your doctor and/or a physical therapist to find out how you can ease your symptoms with an exercise program that’s right for you.']"

You either can’t go easily, or have to go too often, or experience pain or difficulty... Whatever form they take, lower urinary tract symptoms in men are worrisome, uncomfortable and can be a red flag for more serious health problems. It is believed that at any given time, up to 25% of men are affected by urinary issues to some degree or another (1) and as they age, their chances of experiencing and suffering symptoms increase dramatically (2). That’s because lower urinary tract symptoms are often caused by an enlarged prostate, a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia which typically affects older men (2). Fortunately, research into this common - but frustrating - condition has led to the development of new treatments. The first line of attack is usually medication with drugs like “Alpha-blockers” which help relax muscles and blood vessels, with trade names like Hytrin®, Uroxatral®, Cardura® and Flomax®, or “5-alpha reductase inhibitors” (or 5-ARIs) like Propecia®, Proscar® and Avodart®), which affect hormones related to the prostate (2). Men are usually prescribed one or the other, but now scientists are wondering if taking both drugs would work better given they manage different symptoms. One recentsystematic reviewof 15randomized controlled trialsexplored whether taking these drugs together produced better results than if taken alone (3). Over 9,600 men with lower urinary tract symptoms were included in the studies and the average age was 62 to 66 years. Those in the study group were given a combination of alpha-blockers and 5-ARIs and compared to thecontrol groupwho were prescribed just one or the other or aplacebo. The research evidence showed that in the short term (up to a year) combination treatment reduced symptoms more than 5-ARIs alone and about the same as alpha-blockers (3). The long-term effects (two to six years) showed that combination treatment was more effective at reducing symptoms than either drug alone (3). Alpha-blockers can cause side effects such as dizziness and low blood pressure, and may increase the risk of falls, fractures and head injuries as a result (4). 5-ARIs can cause sexual side effects such as decreased libido and erectile dysfunction. Although there were no severe side effects reported in this review, the authors caution that combination drug therapy could increase the number and severity of side effects experienced by patients. If you are experiencing lower urinary tract symptoms, talk to your doctor about your treatment options. Ideally you will be able to benefit from the latest developments and get back to feeling (and going!) as good as new.']"

Another fact: exercise is not only a key to prevention, it has been shown to benefit people who already have heart conditions (2,3). So it stands to reason that people with heart disease should be especially diligent about being physically active, right? Unfortunately that’s not the case for many. Understandably, people with a heart condition worry that exercise might make matters worse, which can discourage them from being active (4,5). However, by not following doctors’ orders to be more physically active, many people actually put themselves at even greater health risk. Can anything be done to encourage people with heart disease to exercise regularly? Physicians and other health care professionals believe health education – teaching, counselling and behaviour modification – can help change behaviours and promote heart healthy habits including the appropriate amounts, types and levels of physical activity. A recent well-donesystematic reviewof 37randomized controlled trialslooked at whether health education programs do, in fact, change exercise behaviour for adults with heart disease (6). The review included more than 10,000 adults with heart disease (average age ranging from 53 to 74) who participated in health education programs lasting from as little as a few days (during the patients’ stay in hospital) to as long as three years. The average program length was five months. Participants received information, counselling and encouragement through face-to-face meetings, telephone calls or printed materials. The evidence reported in the review shows that health education does help to motivate people with heart disease to be more active (6). Participants who took part in an education program exercised more often, for longer periods of time and at higher levels of intensity. The long-term benefits, however, were much less encouraging suggesting that people’s motivation and commitment to exercise may drop off when their health education program ends (6). The review authors do stress that while future research should focus on finding ways to help people stick with their programs, health professionals should continue to encourage patients to join health education programs (6). These can give them the knowledge and confidence to exercise in ways that are safe, effective and heart healthy.

And while kids and teens were often the driving forces behind the purchase of a gaming system, adults of all ages have become hooked on slalom skiing, wakeboarding, mountain climbing and much more... all in the comfort of their living rooms! Virtual reality computer-based technology lets people interact with on-screen activities and objects that simulate the real world. Programs were originally created for entertainment but with the development of add-ons like remote controls that track arm movements and balance boards that monitor changes in the centre of balance (both used in Nintendo®’s Wii Fit system), “exergames” have the added benefit of encouraging physical activity in people of all ages (1). In recent years “exergames” have also been used as a rehabilitation tool for people with various disabilities (2) and there is growing interest in whether they can help improve balance in older adults, which in turn may help reduce falls and resulting injuries (3). Accessible, enjoyable, safe – Wii-based exercise programs sound promising but are they really effective in improving balance control in seniors?Asystematic reviewof 7randomized controlled trialsprovides some answers (4). The studies involved 285 participants over the age of 55 (average age was 70). Those in the study groups participated in Wii exercise programs using a Wii balance board and/or the Wii remote and attended a minimum of 12 sessions at least 35 minutes in length. Their balance was measured before and after the programs using standard tests and compared with acontrol groupwho either did no exercise or did other types of balance-enhancing activities. As you might guess, Wii-based exercises are definitely better than nothing. Balance significantly improved in the study group compared with those who didn’t exercise at all. And Wii-based programs appear to be just as effective as other types of exercise programs in enhancing balance control in older adults (4).A more recentsystematic review, which largely included but was not limited to Wii-based exercises, lent further support to the benefits of active video games for balance in older adults (5). More high quality studies are needed to determine if these positive effects last in the long term, and by no means does the evidence suggest anyone abandon their current exercise routines in favour of virtual reality programs! However it is encouraging news for older people who don’t participate in any type of balance training exercise – perhaps, ironically, because of a fear of falling (6). Using a Wii system at home to develop better balance may give many older adults more confidence to be mobile and active, which may result in a higher quality of life (4). Be sure to clear out tripping hazards and make adequate space in your environment when engaging in active video games like Wii-based exercise.']"

That’s true for everyone but especially for people with diabetes. It is estimated that more than 3 million Canadians live with diagnosed diabetes and considerably more have undiagnosed or pre-diabetes (1). A major concern with diabetes is the increased risk of diabetic foot ulcers: open sores or wounds on the feet (2;3). People with diabetes are 15 times more likely than non-diabetics to develop a foot ulcer sometime during their lifetime (4) which left untreated, can become infected and possibly lead to amputation or even death (5;6). Foot infections are the most common reason Canadians with diabetes are admitted to hospital and an estimated 85% of all amputations in people with diabetes are the result of a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer (2;7). Dr. Perry Mayer, a specialist and authority on diabetic foot care, says several interrelated issues make people with diabetes more prone to foot problems but neuropathy – nerve damage – is at the core. In addition to sensation loss, other symptoms include profound skin dryness, weakness and a loss of balance (2). “Diabetics with neuropathy don’t feel pain, pressure or temperature,” Dr. Mayer says. “They can step into a tub of scalding hot water without feeling it; in fact, the numbness in their feet makes them feel like they’re cold – to the point that they’ll do things like put their feet directly on a heater and burn themselves.” That loss of feeling means people can step on something sharp – a piece of glass or a rock – and not notice, so they don’t remove the object or take care of the open wound. People with diabetes also have other symptoms which make matters worse, including dry skin that can lead to severe cracks in the heels, and muscle deformities that can cause further harm to already damaged skin and tissue (2).\xa0 Add to that poor blood circulation and an impaired ability to heal and people with diabetes face a ‘perfect storm’ for trouble in the form of diabetic foot ulcers. Being aware and alert to the signs and symptoms – loss of feeling, numbness, tingling – is a start, and there are easy ways for patients and family members to test for these changes or signs of infection at home (7;8;9). But as Dr. Mayer points out, diabetes is often described as “the disease of no symptoms” because people don’t notice them in the early stages and by the time they do, the condition has taken a considerable toll. That is why he advises everyone with diabetes to check, clean and moisturize their feet every day, and be on the lookout for cuts, cracks, blisters, dryness, thick toenails, discoloration and open wounds. He recommends wearing proper fitting shoes and “never, ever walk around barefoot!” This advice is backed up by published guidelines on managing and preventing foot problems for people with diabetes (2;10). Dr. Mayer also recommends regular screening from a doctor or foot specialist for all people with diabetes, along with careful monitoring and maintenance. “The good news is that research indicates up to 85% of diabetic foot amputations can be avoided” (2;11).\xa0Evidence shows that foot assessments, discussions with your doctor about how to take proper care of your feet, and follow-up visits significantly reduce foot problems (9). New ways of measuring a patient’s risk for foot ulcers can now help doctors better predict and prevent them (12;13), but often doctors do not screen for or notice foot ulcers before they become a big problem (14), meaning that the patient has a big role to play in preventing foot ulcers. As Dr. Mayer states, self-care to prevent and treat foot ulcers “will ultimately help save their lives” (5;6).']"

It’s believed the decline can begin as early as our 40s and becomes more pronounced by the time we reach our mid 60s (1). But just because it’s normal that doesn’t mean we have to take it lying down – in fact, the best advice is to do exactly the opposite! Walking, sports, recreational activities: there are many ways to get exercise but your routine should also include some strength or resistance training exercise to help build and maintain muscle (2). That’s particularly important for seniors as it improves strength, mobility and balance, all of which minimize the risk of falls (3). Options for strength training include bodybuilding machines as well as free weights – gyms and fitness centres are full of them. But some older adults may not be able to, or even want to, go to a gym. On the other hand home exercise equipment can be expensive, bulky and cumbersome. A potential solution is resistance training using elastic materials in the shape of bands or tubes. They’re easily available, inexpensive and take up hardly any space. But can these simple elastic bands really help increase muscle strength? To answer that question, asystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 10randomized controlled trialsinvolving a total of 834 people between the ages of 60 and 79 (4). Their strength was measured both before and after participating in resistance training programs. The programs ranged from six to 24 weeks with participants training from one to five times a week. The studies included participants with a range of health conditions: some were considered healthy; some had functional disabilities; others had multiple or chronic conditions. The elastic resistance training included a variety of exercises, targeting muscles in both the upper and lower body. Evidence from thesystematic reviewsupports using elastic resistance training as an effective way of increasing muscle strength among older adults. The effects of training with elastic bands or tubes were most pronounced in healthy older adults as well as those with some physical limitations. Improvements were less obvious in people with more serious conditions such as COPD. One of the main advantages of elastic bands or tubes is that they can be used to perform a wide variety of exercises and are appropriate for people of all fitness levels: it is easy to alter the amount of resistance as needed.

People of all ages can be affected, but postmenopausal women and older adults are at higher risk because their bones tend to be less strong to begin with (1,2). Fortunately, there are drugs that help increase bone strength and help to prevent broken bones or fractures. Bisphosphonates are pills or injections that doctors commonly prescribe to people with osteoporosis. They are usually prescribed for a period of three to five years and work to slow bone loss (3). Bisphosphonate therapy is widely recommended by medical experts and research shows they work well to help prevent broken bones among people at risk (4). But recently, concerns have been raised that these medications may increase the risk for heart-related problems (5). The issue has prompted considerable research, including 12 studies selected for asystematic reviewto find out whether bisphosphonates are associated with heart conditions and problems (6). The studies involved over 190,000 men and women between the ages of 50 and 89 who had osteoporosis and/or had undergone surgery for hip fracture. They were given bisphosphonates, either in pill form or through an injection, including zoledronic acid (Reclast®, Zometa®), alendronate (Fosamax®), risedronate (Actonel®, Atelvia®), and ibandronate (Boniva®). People who were given bisphosphonates had an increased risk of irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation), which was sometimes serious enough to require a visit to the hospital. On the positive side, the drugs did not appear to increase the risk of stroke or any other cardiovascular incident causing death. The benefits of bisphosphonates in improving bone strength are well documented and these medications are a good choice for many people to help them stay strong and mobile. However, those with less than healthy hearts may not be good candidates for bisphosphonate therapy. If you have osteoporosis, talk to your doctor about whether bisphosphonates are the best choice for you based on your own circumstances and risk of heart problems.']"

In Canada, about 90% of people with this condition have type 2 diabetes, which occurs when the body does not effectively make, release or use insulin (1). Insulin is a hormone that helps the body convert sugar into energy. For people with type 2 diabetes, sugar can quickly build up in the blood and cause hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) which can lead to serious health problems, even death (1). While changes in diet and physical activity are the first strategies used to manage type 2 diabetes, many people also use medication – “oral hypoglycemic agents” (such as metformin) or insulin – to help control their blood sugar levels. People who take insulin must monitor their blood sugar levels regularly and give themselves injections of insulin, often several times a day, as instructed by their health care providers. For many people with diabetes, taking insulin is a vital part of their self-care routine. However it’s not without its shortcomings. For example if insulin levels are not carefully balanced with diet, people can experience hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) and weight gain (2). That’s why a relatively new type of injectable drug is getting a lot of attention. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists (such as exenitide and liraglutide) work by mimicking the functions of certain hormones in the body that help lower blood sugar levels after eating (3). In theory, when used in combination with insulin, GLP-1 agonists should not only offer better blood sugar control but also reduce the risk of both low blood sugar and weight gain, or even actually help lower weight. It sounds good, but is it too good to be true? Asystematic reviewexamined the results of 15 studies – all randomized controlled trials. More than 4,300 men and women with type 2 diabetes were prescribed either GLP-1 agonists with insulin or another diabetic treatment – generally insulin alone. Participants’ blood sugar levels and weight were measured over at least 12 weeks of this treatment (4). Compared with other treatments for diabetes, GLP-1 agonists – combined with insulin – consistently and significantly improved blood sugar levels without increasing the risk of low blood sugar. And not only did the drugs prevent further weight gain, they actually contributed to weight loss (4). This is a promising finding, because if blood sugar can be controlled more effectively, and if low blood sugar and weight gain are no longer among the frustrations associated with the condition, diabetes management may become easier for millions of people. More recently, newer versions of GLP-1 agonists have become available that only need to be taken once a week (such as exenatide-long-acting-release, dulaglutide, and taspoglutide). Research shows that these weekly medications might be more effective in controlling blood sugar levels than some GLP-1 agonists that have to be taken more frequently, while causing similar weight loss and side effects (5). The evidence behind GLP-1 agonists, regardless of the frequency that they need to be taken, has been  highly encouraging. Further research will need to address questions about the long-term effectiveness, safety, and side effects of GLP-1 agonists.']"

Family caregivers of people with dementia may benefit from online and telephone support,"['They’re often referred to as the “invisible second patients” (1) and unsung heroes, but caregivers of family members with dementia are finally being noticed and recognized for the important role they play – often at the expense of their own health and quality of life. Conservative estimates put the number of people with dementia at 36 million worldwide (2). Most live at home and are cared for by “informal” caregivers – usually a spouse or other family member. These individuals can devote several years caring for loved ones and coping with situations that are demanding, ever changing and stressful. As a result, caregivers often suffer from physical and emotional problems (3). In many places there are now support services for caregivers – often group sessions or one-on-one meetings and training with care experts. Studies have shown that these help to improve the mood and quality of life for many caregivers and help prolong the time a person with dementia is able to receive care at home (4). That’s an important consideration given the high costs and limited availability of institutional care beds – and a further reason for finding helpful ways to support informal caregivers. While “face-to-face” support programs can be beneficial, they may not be available in all communities or to everyone who needs them. Also, caregivers may be unable or unwilling to leave their loved ones alone to attend the sessions. For these reasons, telephone and internet-delivered support may be a cost effective alternative that more people will be able to benefit from – assuming it works. We found twosystematic reviewson the topic that aimed to find out (5 ; 6). A high quality systematic review found that in caregivers of people with dementia, internet support helped to improve some aspects of well-being such as self-confidence and self-efficacy (perception of one’s ability to manage a situation), as well as reduce stress, burden and depression. There didn’t appear to be any notable improvements to caregivers’ quality of life, coping skills or physical health, but since only a small number of studies reported on these outcomes, the review authors recommend further research (5). Not surprisingly, the most helpful internet-based support programs were those that included more than just information, especially those that included personal connections, such as customized coaching and the chance to interact with other caregivers (5). An additional and more recent high quality systematic review also found that interventions that combined both telephone and internet support were the most effective at reducing depression and increasing self-efficacy in caregivers of people with dementia (6). So, while internet and telephone support programs don’t relieve the symptoms of dementia, the right programs may help relieve the feelings of isolation commonly experienced by caregivers.

320,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2015/07/03/enjoy-your-retirement---but-keep-moving!,3 July 2015,Enjoy your retirement - but keep moving!,"['When looking forward to retirement we think about the things we’ll stop doing (ie. work for a living) and the things we’ll start doing: travel, hobbies, spending more time with friends and family – essentially doing more of what we enjoy and taking life at a more leisurely pace. Some people also make plans to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including getting regular exercise. That’s commendable and a great strategy for staying fit and active, assuming they actually follow through! But unfortunately many don’t: studies show that less than half of all adults get the recommended amounts of exercise (1;2). What’s more, during major life events and transitions – including retirement – people tend to also change their physical and social activities, usually for the worse (3). That’s worrisome because lack of exercise is a leading cause of death and disease: in addition to increasing the length of your life, regular exercise reduces the risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes and some cancers (4). As the likelihood of disease and disability increases with age it’s all the more important for people to exercise and remain physically active after retirement. Programs to help people develop good exercise habits may get them on the right track, but do people keep up those habits in the longer term? To help answer that question,asystematic reviewexamined the results of 21 randomized controlled trials involving more than 10,500 men and women aged 55 to 70. Participants were given health-related information and counselling about the importance of exercise and a healthy lifestyle, and a standard goal of 150 minutes or more of physical activity a week. Some of the exercise programs were also tailored to the needs and abilities of the people involved. Participants measured their activity levels (reporting on their activities or using a pedometer) at 12 months and beyond (up to 24 months). These results were compared to a control group of people who were not part of the program (5). The good news is that this type of support and encouragement does appear to be effective in kick-starting an exercise program and getting people motivated to be active on a regular basis. A year after the start of their programs, step counts and activity levels were significantly higher in the groups getting the support. The bad news is that in the longer term – a year and a half to two years later – people did not always keep up their activity levels. Newer research shows that electronic programs might also be a promising way to increase physical activity. Asystematic reviewof 84 studies found that internet and text message-based programs  increased exercise levels in older adults when compared to non-electronic programs. Unfortunately, more evidence is needed to comment on the long-term effects of these programs (6). All too often people begin diet, fitness and other self-improvement programs with great enthusiasm and good intentions, only to have their motivation “fizzle out” over time. That may be human nature, but it can have a profound effect on our health. To improve or maintain fitness, mobility, body weight and overall physical and mental health, adults 65 and older are encouraged to engage in at least 150 minutes (that’s 2 ½ hours) of moderate to vigorous physical activity each week (7). So by all means enjoy your retirement and everything that comes with this new phase of your life – just make sure you get a regular dose of exercise so that you stay healthy and get to enjoy it for a good, long time!

From simple pedometers that count steps to state-of-the-art digital or electronic devices and applications that track activity, heart rate, eating and sleeping patterns and more, mobile/wearable technologies continue to be popular. People buy them to lose weight, increase strength and endurance, eat well – in short, live better and longer. But while they may not be frivolous, do they really help? That’s important to know, particularly as wearable technologies are now being used in healthcare to help people manage chronic diseases and conditions that put them at increased health risk (1). So far, much of the research has explored the benefits of these tools for specific populations such as older adults (2), or people who are overweight and at a higher risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer and osteoarthritis (3, 4). One suchsystematic reviewlooked at the results of seven studies with a total of 584 adults who were overweight or obese, all of whom were counselled about diet and exercise to help them lose weight (5). Some participants were also given mobile devices (e.g. pager, mobile phone, etc.) and received motivational messages and/or recorded what they ate and how much they exercised. At the end of the study period (which ranged from nine weeks to a year) the researchers measured how much weight these participants had lost compared to people who had not used a mobile device. So, does the technology work? There was consistent and strong evidence that – at least in the short term – these devises encourage exercise and activity that leads to greater weight loss. Only one of the studies, however, reported weight loss after one year so it isn’t clear if there are long-term benefits. Another reviewlooked at the benefits of mobile devices for people with type-2 diabetes, and whether they encouraged people to exercise. The review included 24 randomized controlled trials and close to 3,000 participants aged 47 to 70 (6). One group in each study received one-on-one counselling and set goals for physical activity, then used some type of mobile device (pedometers, accelerometers, etc.) to monitor their activity.\xa0 They were compared with participants receiving the usual care, as well as information and/or encouragement to exercise. Studies lasted an average of 31 weeks (7-8 months long). Once again, wearable technology helped to get people moving: participants using the devices recorded more steps per day, spent more time walking and exercising, and expended more energy. This group also had small but notable improvements in blood sugar levels, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure. At least in the short term, mobile or wearable digital devices appear to help people exercise more and lose weight. More research is needed to find out if people stick to their goals in the long term. Counselling, goal setting, motivation and support were central to both sets of studies - an activity monitor/device appears to be a useful part of a weight loss and fitness plan once people understand the importance of exercise, and are clear about what they want to achieve. This research evidence is welcome news for us gadget fans, as it helps justify what can be a relatively expensive purchase. That is - of course - as long as we actually wear and use it as intended... not let it become another addition to the junk drawer!

Home-based primary care may be a solution for homebound older adults","['Do you remember when doctors made house calls? If not, you may remember your elders reminiscing about it, or you have a mental image – likely based on old movies – of a kindly gentleman making his way up the street, doctor-bag in hand.Today, house visits by doctors are not completely unheard of but they are a rarity, particularly in larger urban communities (1). For a host of reasons including time, money, transportation and safety concerns (2), “calling for the doctor” has been replaced with “going to the doctor.” However, what about people who need medical care but struggle with the “going to” part? At any given time there are at least 100,000 permanently homebound adults in Canada, most of them elderly, frail and overwhelmed by multiple medical and social problems (3). Their circumstances make it difficult, if not impossible, to travel to doctors’ offices or clinics so they often don’t go – until there’s a crisis, at which point they tend to end up in the emergency department and/or are hospitalized (4). This has led to the development of home-based primary care programs and there is keen interest in finding out whether they are a viable option for healthcare delivery to this vulnerable segment of the population Ahigh-qualitysystematic reviewof nine studies provides some insight. The studies assessed the impact of home-based primary care on outcomes such how often older adults went to the emergency department or were admitted to hospital or long-term care, as well as how many days they spent there. The studies also measured the effects on the patients and their caregivers (for example, their satisfaction with care and quality of life) and impact on healthcare costs (5). More than 46,000 participants – all housebound adults aged 65 or older – received home-based primary healthcare from an integrated team of medical professionals including general practitioners, geriatricians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, social workers, physiotherapists, dietitians and dental hygienists. Approaches varied, but most included an initial in-home assessment and development of a care-plan, regular follow-up visits and/or phone calls, urgent care visits as needed and regular healthcare team meetings (5). There is strong evidence that home-based primary care helps to improve the health of patients. For example, after receiving regular medical care in their homes, older adults were admitted to hospital and long-term care facilities less often and/or spent fewer days in institutional care. Also they, and their family caregivers, reported a greater satisfaction with care, enjoyed a higher quality of life and played a more active role in making health and end-of-life decisions (5). Home-based primary care might also be a promising option for older adults with chronic illnesses (6;7). Onesystematic reviewshows that home visits by healthcare providers can improve blood sugar, blood pressure, and quality of life for people with diabetes (6).Anotherfound that this type of care might even better meet the needs of chronically ill older adults than hospital-based care. Older adults at the highest risk of hospitalization have the greatest potential to benefit from this service (7). Key components of a successful home-based primary care program include: a thorough initial geriatric assessment of each patient; an integrated, inter-professional care team; regular care team meetings; and an after-hours telephone support line for emergencies (5).']"

In other words, when it comes to depression you may have won the battle but not necessarily the war. That’s because people who have suffered previous episodes of depression are believed to be more prone to negative thought patterns and to be more influenced by them (2). Mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, or MBCT, was developed in response to the need for new ways to cope with the aftermath of depression that didn’t rely on the long-term use of anti-depressants (3). MBCT combines cognitive behavioural therapy with mindfulness, a type of meditation that focuses on being in the present moment.\xa0It is typically offered during an 8-week group program, delivered by MBCT-trained therapists who incorporate relaxation, meditation and other exercises/techniques into the sessions to promote greater self awareness and control. Participants are encouraged to practice the exercises at home so they will learn to better recognize negative thinking and deal with it before it triggers another bout of depression. Results from several research studies on the benefits of MBCT have been encouraging (4).One high qualitysystematic reviewof 11randomized controlled trials, involving more than 850 participants with disorders including depression and anxiety, assessed the effectiveness and safety of MCBT for the treatment of depression as well as other mental health disorders (5). Both the study and control groups received “usual” treatment (combination of antidepressants and therapy) but the study groups also participated in MBCT sessions. MBCT appeared to be effective in helping people avoid recurrences of depression. For example at the one-year follow-up, MBCT reduced the rate of relapse in people with three or more previous episodes of depression by a significant 40%. Depression “scores,” measured after completion of MBCT and a year later, were also significantly lower. There were also small but significant improvements in participants’ level of anxiety. Mindfulness-based programs are also accessible online. Arecent systematic reviewof 15 randomized controlled trials found that people taking part in mindfulness-based programs over the Internet showed small improvements in depression and increase in well-being (5). One challenge with a do-it-yourself approach like online therapy is sticking to it, and this review found that people who also received guidance from a trained therapist or who participated in more sessions were even more likely to experience the benefits. Although it is still a relatively “new” therapy, MBCT has captured the attention and support of patients and mental health practitioners worldwide. The war against depression and mental illness may still be raging, but MBCT could help bring us closer to victory!']"

For many patients, testing does not improve health and can cause – rather than relieve – anxiety. That’s certainly the case for prostate cancer, which is the most commonly diagnosed non-skin cancer in men and the third leading cause of cancer-related death among men in Canada (1). The good news is the long-term prognosis is encouraging: the 10-year estimated survival ratio is 95%, the highest among all cancers in men (2). The bad news is that a widely-used screening tool for prostate cancer - the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test - is not very reliable. The PSA test is a blood test to check for the presence of a protein that is produced by the prostate cells. A high PSA level may be a red flag for cancer, although not necessarily. \xa0'False positive' results are also common. A prostate cancer diagnosis can be scary and many men do die of the disease, but most cases of prostate cancer actually progress slowly and men can live with prostate cancer without symptoms. A positive result from a PSA test can cause a lot of anxiety for men, particularly when the results are false, or lead to the detection of cancers that never would have progressed to the point of causing death or any health concerns. Meanwhile, men who test high for PSA levels usually undergo further tests including prostate biopsy, which is painful and may cause infection, blood in the urine and hospitalization. These issues have prompted researchers to look more closely at the pros and cons of PSA testing. Asystematic reviewfrom 2014,\xa0conducted in partnership with the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care, examined the results of three randomized controlled trials involving more than 200,000 men (3). More recently, asystematic reviewcontaining three randomized controlled trials involving more than 600,000 men was conducted for the US Preventive Services Task Force (4).The purpose of these reviews was to assess the benefits and harms of screening for prostate cancer using the PSA test (3;4). The benefits of PSA screening were not consistent between studies. What were notable were the associated harms of screening including high chance of false-positive results, the dangers of complications from follow-up prostate biopsies, and overdiagnosis (3;4). These potential risks, weighed against the benefits, led the Canadian Task Force on Preventative Health Care to recommend the PSA test not be used to screen for cancer, particularly in men under the age of 55 and over the age of 70 (3). Men aged 55 to 69, the highest risk group, are advised to seek expert advice and find out about other options before deciding to have a PSA test (3). It is important to note that the task force’s recommendation is not a universally accepted one. For example Prostate Cancer Canada’s position is that the benefits of PSA screening outweigh the negatives and that eliminating it would result in a significant increase in prostate cancer deaths (5). So what’s a guy to do?! As always, and particularly in this case, men are urged to consult with their doctors to fully understand the benefits and harms of PSA testing. Your physician will help you choose the best course of action based on your individual circumstances (including ethnicity, family history of disease and other risk factors) and personal preferences. \xa0Decision aids in the form of brief booklets are also available to help you make informed choices about tough issues such as prostate cancer screening (6). One thing everyone agrees on: new, more accurate and effective screening tools are urgently needed to safely detect and treat prostate cancer.

The type, frequency and intensity of services vary depending on the person’s needs but they usually involve housing, assistance with day-to-day activities and/or medical care. Most long-term care patients are 65 years or older (1).Traditionally, long-term care has been associated with institutions such as nursing homes that provide 24-hour room and board, supervision and nursing/medical care. But long-term care is also provided in other settings: at home (either the individual’s home or that of a family member) or at one of several other types of residential/assisted living facilities.The majority of older adults receive long-term care informally at home, from unpaid non-professionals – usually family members or friends (2). As needs change, the family may arrange for additional support, for example, a weekly or biweekly visit from a home care professional. Initially, the main advantage of home/community-based care was that it was much less expensive than going into a nursing home. Today, that’s still a factor for some, but it’s usually not the most important one. As more and more older adults strive to stay active, maintain their independence and enjoy a good quality of life, many prefer home/community-based long-term care (3).It sounds great but it begs the question, is it a safe and effective long-term care option? To answer this question, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (based in the US)compiled, reviewed and summarized the results of 32 studiesconducted from 1995 to 2012 comparing home/community-based care and assisted living to nursing home care for older adults (4). What they found was that changes in physical and thinking abilities and emotional well-being did not differ greatly between nursing home and assisted living residents. There was also no significant difference in the mortality rate between residents in these two environments.The comparisons between nursing home care and home/community-based care were not as clear, however the researchers found that different living environments pose different risks.\xa0 For example, nursing home residents were less likely to experience pain or use anti-anxiety medication but were more likely to get pneumonia or have a pressure sore than older adults who were receiving home/community-based care.What does that mean for older adults and their families weighing the pros and cons of long-term care options? While the evidence is considered “low-strength” and further research is recommended, these studies suggest that the risks and benefits may not be significantly different between home/community-based care, assisted living or nursing home care. Ultimately the best setting suits the needs and unique circumstances of each individual and the people caring for them.']"

People take them to make up for deficiencies in their diets, boost their immune systems, fight disease and promote overall good health.Fatty acid supplements have been of particular interest as more information comes to light about the important role fatty acids play in maintaining optimal health, including reducing the risk of heart disease. They include omega-3, which you get from eating certain kinds of “fatty” fish (e.g. salmon, tuna, mackerel) and from plant sources such as nuts and seeds. Nutritional guidelines suggest at least two servings of fatty fish a week (1). Omega-6, another fatty acid, is also found in nuts and seeds, as well as vegetable oils (2).As many people can’t – or don’t want to – get their omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids from food, supplements would appear to be an effective alternative (3) and several research studies have attempted to determine whether, in fact, they are.A recent systematic reviewfocused specifically on people who already had heart issues (such as coronary artery disease, angina, irregular heartbeat) and tried to find out if taking fatty acid supplements would help prevent heart attacks (4). The review included 27 randomized controlled trials and involved more than 105,000 people. Some study participants (intervention group) were given either plant or fish-based omega-3 or omega-6 fatty acid supplements and others were not (control group). There was virtually no difference in the number of heart attacks suffered by people taking the supplements compared to the control group. Fish-based omega-3 supplements appeared to have a slight beneficial effect on heart health but the evidence was not conclusive.The authors of the review acknowledge limitations with some of the included studies and urge further research, especially as there have been more encouraging results from related studies. For example,another recent systematic reviewfound that fish oil supplements may help lower blood pressure.That could potentially prevent future problems for many. But people coping with pre-existing heart conditions may want to pass on the fatty acid supplements in favour of more proven treatments.']"

Now, instead of rushing out to buy that “amazing” product, we’re more inclined to wait and see if the advertising claims really do hold up. That’s also a wise attitude to adopt when it comes to new drugs and medical procedures. Even though they’ve undergone extensive testing before being approved, there could be side effects or adverse reactions that only surface after they’ve been in use for some time and that call for further investigation. A good example of this is the new oral anticoagulants, belonging to the blood thinners’ family. Blood thinners are usually given to people at risk of developing blood clots due to conditions such as atrial fibrillation (a common type of irregular heart beat potentially complicated by stroke (2)) and venous thromboembolism (clots which form in the vein, then break loose and travel to the lungs (1)). Older adults are especially at risk of clots and complications from clots (3). For many years, the unique oral blood thinning medicine on the market has been warfarin, which requires extremely careful monitoring and regular dose adjustments by doctors (4). Enter the new pills on the block: dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban (trade names Pradaxa®, Xarelto® and Eliquis® respectively). They are good at preventing blood clots, require less monitoring, and are simpler for people to take (e.g. just one or two pills daily). However concerns have arisen about the pills causing excessive bleeding in older adults (5;6). Several research studies were conducted to test the new blood thinners, including 10 randomized controlled trials that formed the basis ofa recent systematic review.The purpose of the review was to find out if the pills helped prevent heart attacks and strokes and if they caused side effects such as bleeding (7). The participants – more than 25,000 men and women aged 75 or older – were put on blood thinners because they had venous thromboembolism, pulmonary embolism, atrial fibrillation or were critically ill. The studies showed that the new blood thinners did not cause serious bleeding and were at least as effective, if not more so, than the usual treatment in preventing heart attacks, strokes or deaths from cardiac disease in elderly adults. Another 2014 systematic review, this one involving 45 randomized controlled trials and close to 45,000 participants with acute venous thromboembolism, produced similar findings (8). Several treatments and treatment combinations were compared and while all of the newer options prevented clots at least as well as – if not better than – traditional drugs, rivaroxaban and apixaban caused less serious bleeding. Even more reassuring for people prescribed these blood thinners: a new antidote has been proven to quickly reverse the effects of these medications and stop bleeding within minutes in an emergency (9). While it would appear that in these cases the pills are indeed both new and improved, the authors of the reviews caution against a “one drug fits all” approach. People should talk to their doctors about any special concerns, including their risk for bleeding, to ensure they’re prescribed the appropriate medication.

One approach – person-centred care – seeks to create a more respectful, positive environment by emphasizing the individuals’ abilities, habits, interests and wishes. So far, it’s showing great promise: person-centred care appears to result in less aggression, fewer falls and increased participation in tasks, among other benefits (5). But how does it affect caregivers and the way they perform and feel about their responsibilities? Does it result in more or less job stress?Those are important considerations because of the close interrelationships between dementia patients and their caregivers. Person-centred care may be a preferred approach, but if caregivers are feeling burned out, those feelings will negatively affect care delivery (6).A recent systematic reviewis thought to be the first to address the impact of person-centred care on staff providing that care (7). Seven studies were included in the review and the participants – caregivers in residential care facilities – received extensive training in how best to interact with patients. For example, emotion-oriented approaches include reminiscence therapy and other ways of enhancing mood and feelings of self worth, while stimulation-oriented approaches encourage participation and social engagement through activities like art, music and dance. While there are limitations with the review, including a limited amount of evidence, most of the studies show positive outcomes with staff reporting less stress, burnout and job dissatisfaction, pointing to potential benefits of person-centred care for caregivers. Further investigation into this important aspect of dementia care is urged.

That’s changing as people understand and embrace the objectives of end of life and palliative care: addressing physical, emotional and spiritual needs, maximizing quality of life and helping satisfy individuals’ desires and preferences - including how and where they want to spend their final days and where they want to die.For the majority of people (well over 50% according to recent research) that means being cared for, and dying, in their own homes (1;2). Home palliative care services make it possible to respect those wishes, while ensuring patients in the advanced stage of an illness – and their family caregivers – receive the help and support they need.A well-donesystematic reviewof relevant studiesattempted to determine whether home palliative care does actually increase the chance of patients dying at home (2). The review also explored related questions, such as whether home palliative care services helped improve management of symptoms and quality of life for the patient and reduced distress in family caregivers.A total of 23 studies, including 16 randomized controlled trials, involved more than 37,500 patients (mean age ranged from 53 to 77) and more than 4,000 family caregivers (primarily spouses of the patients). Care was provided by teams of two to 13 health professionals including doctors, nurses and social workers specializing in palliative care and end of life treatment. In some cases, caregiver support was provided.What the research tells us There is strong evidence that compared with usual care (i.e in hospitals, hospices and nursing homes), home palliative care increases the likelihood of a patient dying at home (3;4). It also helps to reduce suffering caused by symptoms by a small degree (3).Home palliative care did not have any significant impact on caregivers’ grief in the first 13 months following their loved one’s death (3). There was not enough evidence to draw conclusions about quality of life or the effects on caregiver burden (3;4).Further research is warranted, including additional investigation into the cost-effectiveness of services. Meanwhile home palliative care offers important benefits and appears to be an alternative option for patients, their families and caregivers whose end of life wishes include dying at home.']"

Quit smoking to reduce the risk of complications,"['The health risks associated with cigarette smoking are numerous, serious and well-documented. Whether or not we smoke we all know it’s a dangerous habit and that there are many compelling reasons to quit. But here’s one we might not think of until faced with the situation: people who smoke are significantly more likely to experience complications after having surgery (1).Risks are greater because of how smoking affects the body, especially the heart and lungs. The presence of nicotine in the bloodstream puts extra strain on the heart during anaesthesia and surgery, while carbon monoxide in the blood interferes with the delivery of oxygen throughout the body – critical for proper healing (2). Smoking damages the lining of the lungs, putting people at higher risk for pneumonia and other breathing difficulties (3). Making matters worse, smokers have a weakened immune system so are less able to fight off infections resulting from surgery or that occur during recovery (4).A solution would be for\xa0people to stop smoking – for good – prior to having elective surgery, but as anyone who has tried to quit knows, it isn’t that simple. However quitting for even a short time – a day or two – may minimize potential problems during and after surgery (2;5).How can we encourage that?A recently published systematic reviewof 13 randomized controlled trials sought to find out if pre-surgery smoking cessation treatments are effective in the short and long term, and if they result in fewer complications (6). The studies involved a total of 1,210 participants, all of whom were having elective surgery for a wide variety of health issues. They received behavioural treatments including face-to-face, telephone, or computer-assisted counselling that was either brief in nature (typically one short information session at least a few days before surgery) or intensive – weekly sessions over a period of four to eight weeks. Some participants were offered nicotine replacement therapy or other medications in addition to the behaviour treatments. There is modest evidence that pre-surgery behavioural treatments help people stop smoking, at least in the short term. Compared with the control group (little or no smoking cessation treatment), 12 more people out of 100 who received brief treatment, and 46 more people out of 100 who underwent intensive treatment, had stopped smoking at the time of their surgeries. The intensive treatment group also had considerably fewer post-surgery complications and were more likely to have abstained from smoking for the next year.While the results indicate that intensive treatment to stop smoking should begin at least four weeks before a scheduled procedure, for best results and optimal health smokers are encouraged to take steps to quit as soon as possible, even before they ever need surgery!']"

At some point we may become “frail,” a term yet to be clearly defined but one that generally refers to older adults who are weak, exhausted, have limited physical function, and walk slowly – if at all (1;2). There is no way to predict when someone will become frail. We know of seniors in their 80s and 90s who are still healthy and active and show no signs of slowing down, while people 20 or more years their junior are already struggling with mobility issues and performing routine tasks. Keeping older adults active and independent for as long as possible – while promoting their health and safety – are priorities for our healthcare system. Seniors who become frail are at greater risk of falling, getting hurt, becoming disabled and being hospitalized (3). For seniors and their families, symptoms of frailty seriously detract from a good quality of life and enjoyment of those “golden years.” So what can be done? Physical exercise has long been prescribed as a way to improve physical functioning in older adults and several relevant studies have shown promising results (4;5). Research specific to frail older adults was the focus of asystematic reviewto determine if exercise improved mobility, walking speed, muscle strength, balance and endurance (6). The review examined 19 randomized controlled trials involving more than 1,500 community-dwelling older adults. Participants took part in multi-component exercise programs including aerobic and strength training activities. The results were encouraging for at least some outcomes: physical exercise appeared to significantly increase walking speed and to modestly improve other aspects of movement and mobility in frail older adults (6). An evenmore recentumbrella reviewlooking at multicompetent exercises—which included aerobic, balance, resistance, and flexibility activities—in community-dwelling older adults who were frail or at high-risk of becoming frail lent further support to previous findings on walking speed and physical performance. Additionally, it highlighted new benefits such as the potential for improvements in muscle strength and balance. In terms of stand-alone exercises, resistance training seemed to be especially effective in enhancing muscle strength, walking speed, and physical performance (7). More research is needed on how often or at what intensity exercises should be performed for the best results. Research to address such questions will help in the design and delivery of more effective programs to help older adults stay active, engaged and moving with confidence (6;7). Many of these types of exercise can be done at home. This is handy during instances that call for spending more time at home and physical distancing, similar to what we're experiencing with the current COVID-19 pandemic. Being at home for long periods of time can decrease activity levels, so for folks who are frail or pre-frail, keeping physically active in this setting is vital for reducing the progression of frailty.

It sounds simple enough, but for most of us it’s easier said than done. We try to practice good habits – at least most of the time – and limit our indulgences. But far too many people consistently make poor choices, putting themselves at risk for serious health problems, including heart disease (1). That’s worrisome enough, but what’s even more alarming is that many people are already at increased risk for cardiovascular disease due to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, high risk of diabetes or because they smoke or are significantly overweight (2;3). While these risk factors can be improved with changes to diet and exercise, some people are unable to make or maintain these changes on their own. For them, the intensive guidance and support offered by behavioural lifestyle counselling programs could be the solution. Research has shown that lifestyle interventions in people at risk for type 2 diabetes may decrease or postpone their risk of progressing to diabetes (4), but what about those at risk for heart disease? To better determine if such programs benefit people with cardiovascular risk factors,asystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 74 relevant studies conducted between 1990 and 2013. Most involved a combination of diet and exercise counselling, with some focusing on diet or exercise only. Participants (more than 34,000 across the 74 studies) were men and women aged 40 to 71 who had at least one risk factor for heart disease. The programs lasted an average of 12 months, included individualized care plans, and were delivered by dietitians, nutritionists, physiotherapists and exercise professionals (5). So do lifestyle counselling programs help? In a word, yes. The studies showed improvements in dietary and physical activity behaviours and reductions in cholesterol levels, blood pressure, weight, glucose levels (5;6) and incidence of diabetes (5). While the reductions were small to moderate, they may still translate into fewer strokes or reduced stroke risk (5;6), and fewer heart attacks (5). The review points out that although intensive lifestyle counselling programs can be beneficial, they involve resources that may not be available or funded through healthcare systems. Future research might address alternate ways of offering lifestyle counselling support at a lower cost (5).']"

It can be said about all kinds of repairs: to our homes, our cars and sometimes, more seriously, to our own health and well-being. We start taking medication for a certain problem or condition, but later discover it’s causing another health issue. Perhaps the drugs are triggering unpleasant side effects or maybe they’re reacting poorly with something else we’re taking but either way, it’s frustrating and we wonder if we’re worse off than we were before. A good example is “psychotropic” medications which affect mood, thinking and behaviour and include sleeping pills, anxiety-reducing drugs, antidepressants and antipsychotics. While they may help improve specific symptoms, they are known to increase the risk of disorientation and falls, particularly in seniors (1). Since many older adults are already prone to falls and confusion, taking these drugs further increases the chance of falling and getting hurt (2). A potential preventative measure may be to simply stop. In recent years there has been a shift in the way health professionals view the use of medications for older adults and a growing trend toward restricting or stopping certain drugs that could have adverse side effects. This important topic is sure to be the focus of ongoing research in the coming years. Meanwhile,a recent systematic reviewidentified and analyzed nine studies to determine whether stopping psychotropic medications would reduce falls and improve cognition in older adults. All of the study participants were 65 or older and had a history of falling and/or cognitive impairment (3). There was evidence that stopping the drugs in question did result in fewer falls as well as improvements in cognitive abilities. Regular medication reviews by a family doctor were also shown to be an effective strategy for preventing falls and other problems associated with some drugs. Having a bad reaction to medication can happen to anyone, but older adults are particularly vulnerable because as we age we are more likely to have multiple health issues causing us to take a number of different drugs at the same time. Sometimes that’s necessary and unavoidable however “polypharmacy,” the use of multiple medications, can pose serious risks and threats to the optimal aging process.']"

But for people with obstructive sleep apnea, getting an adequate amount of restful sleep is a challenge. This serious – but common – condition affects people of all ages but especially middle-aged and older adults as well as those carrying excess weight (1). Obstructive sleep apnea involves temporary blockages of the airway, caused when the tongue and throat muscles relax. Sufferers stop breathing until the need for oxygen causes them to wake briefly to gasp for air. This occurs several times a night, usually accompanied by loud snoring. The brief but frequent awakenings mean that people don’t get the deep uninterrupted sleep they need* so they feel drowsy during the day. They may have low energy, be listless and/or irritable, and be prone to accidents. The problem also affects their partners, the ones most likely to notice and be disturbed by the snoring, choking and gasping. Fortunately, there are treatments. In an effort to determine which are most effective,a 2013 systematic reviewexamined the results of 132 randomized controlled trials, published over a 45-year period (2). All of the participants had obstructive sleep apnea, with an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of at least five. The AHI is the number of times in an hour breathing stops or is reduced during sleep. One of the treatments studied was continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP): a mask worn over the nose delivers a steady air flow to keep the airway from closing during sleep. Other treatments included dental devices (mandibular advancement devices) that fit over the teeth and hold the jaw forward to keep the airway open, weight loss, surgery and medications. The effectiveness of each treatment was measured by comparing AHI scores as well as ratings from the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, which assesses the likelihood of dozing in certain situations. As CPAP is widely considered the standard treatment for obstructive sleep apnea, it is not surprising that it proved to be the most effective. CPAP reduced both the AHI and sleepiness scores by a moderate amount compared to no treatment and reduced AHI more than mandibular advancement devices. But while not quite as effective, dental devices did reduce both AHI and sleepiness scores more than no treatment. There was also some evidence that weight loss can help to improve AHI. The data regarding medication and surgery was inconclusive. Notwithstanding the results, the best treatment for anyone with obstructive sleep apnea is the one he or she can stick with. For example, many people cannot tolerate CPAP, finding it uncomfortable and restrictive (3) so are advised to try one of the other options. What is most important is that they (and their long-suffering partners) get the sound sleep they need to live out their dreams in their waking hours! * Wondering how much sleep you need?Click hereto find out more.']"

Home-based rehabilitation may help get you moving again,"['Hip fractures are common, particularly among older adults. The good news is that they can be treated with surgery. The bad news is that following surgery, older patients have a greater likelihood of experiencing long-term disability: they may become less mobile, less independent and as a result, less able to enjoy a good quality of life (1). Post-surgery rehabilitation programs are designed to help speed recovery and reduce disability through exercises that improve movement, balance and strength (2). Studies have shown that multidisciplinary care – involving services provided by multiple health professionals such as physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses and social workers – is best for treating people who have suffered a broken hip (3;4). What we don’t know for certain, however, is what setting is best for the delivery of such programs. Options include inpatient (at the hospital after surgery), outpatient (post-surgery appointments at the hospital or clinic) or at the patients homes after they’ve been discharged – usually early – from the hospital.\xa0We already know that personalized home-based exercise is a promising strategy for reducing falls and improving strength and balance in people living in the community (5).Onesystematic reviewof five randomized controlled trials attempted to explore this strategy in people recovering from a hip fracture. In particular, this review aimed to find out whether home-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs were effective in helping older adults resume the activities they enjoyed before the fracture (6). Based on the available data, home-based multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs help improve mobility, balance and strength in older adults after hip fracture surgery, at least in the short term. Due to the low number and quality of the studies included in the review, further research is needed to confirm these findings and to learn more – such as the specific elements of an effective rehabilitation program. Meanwhile, it is encouraging that home-based programs appear to be at least as effective as those delivered in inpatient and outpatient settings and provide patients with an additional option for care (6).']"

After all, how can you call it exercise if you’re not gasping for breath and sweating profusely, severely testing the moisture wicking qualities of those specially designed gym clothes? Devoted followers all over the world know better. This mind-body practice that originated in China as a martial art is commonly described as “meditation in motion” and is widely believed to promote good health and well-being (1). The low-impact, slow and controlled movements and deep, natural breathing make it a particularly good physical activity for older adults due to the low risk of injury. Not only does tai chi have a low risk of injury, it may also reduce your chance of falling in the short- and long-term (2). Several studies have proven the effectiveness of tai chi in improving physical conditions in older adults such as poor balance (3) and cardiovascular disease (4) among others; now there is increasing evidence that it can also improve the mind. Arecentsystematic reviewand meta-analysis looked at the impact of exercise on cognitive function –such as memory, working memory, and attention– in adults over 50 with or without mild cognitive\xa0impairment. The review included 39 studies, and one of the types of exercise tested was…you guessed it, tai chi! The exercise programs varied in length, frequency, duration, and intensity (5). Tai chi may be recommended as a safe, drug-free approach to improving brain function in older adults, specifically working memory. Although positive, the results of the review call for additional research (5). Why might tai chi work? Well, it is suggested that the “multimodal” nature of tai chi may hold the key to cognitive improvements. For example, tai chi trains the body and mind through various means: moderate aerobic exercise; agility/mobility training; memorization of skills and routines; concentration exercises and meditation/relaxation techniques. It also provides opportunities for socializing, a factor many believe is associated with improved cognition in older adults (6). Given the many potential benefits and the low risk of adverse effects, tai chi is an ideal activity for older adults – no moisture wicking sportswear needed!']"

If so go ahead and indulge – it isn’t often that something we love to eat may actually be good for us! We’ve known for some time about the benefits of consuming “fatty” fish like salmon, mackerel, tuna, trout, herring and sardines. Their good-for-you omega-3 fatty acids are widely believed to help prevent heart disease (1). Consequently, health advocates around the world recommend two to three servings of fatty fish a week (2). But what if you don’t want to eat fish that often or what if you don’t like fish at all? This is where supplements come in: fish oil capsules are readily available and easy to take (though not nearly as tasty as that salmon filet). Arecent systemic reviewof 17 randomized controlled trials was conducted to find out if they actually do help (3). Specifically, the researchers sought to discover whether fish-oil supplements helped to lower blood pressure, a major factor in reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The studies involved more than 1,500 adults with an average age of 50, approximately half with high blood pressure (140/85 mmHg or greater) and the rest whose blood pressure was normal. The dosages varied but most of the participants took fish-oil capsules a few times a day and all took the supplements for a minimum of eight weeks. Among those with high blood pressure, some were newly diagnosed and not taking any blood pressure lowering medications; others had been taking medication but stopped prior to participating in the study; and some continued to take their usual medications. The results showed that among those with high blood pressure, taking fish oil supplements lowered both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by a small amount (average decreases of 2.56 mmHg and 1.47 mmHg for systolic and diastolic blood pressure respectively). There was no change in blood pressure among those with normal blood pressure. Fish-oil supplements are not recommended as an alternate therapy for people who have been prescribed blood pressure-lowering medications. However, eating fatty fish or taking fish oil supplements may be an additional strategy for helping to lower blood pressure and maintaining heart health.']"

Maybe you can’t even clearly define it, but something’s definitely different. More than likely it’s nothing serious. But – and once the thought enters your mind it’s impossible to ignore –what if it is?! You wonder if you should have it checked. You don’t want to make what might be multiple trips to doctors, and are even less keen about undergoing uncomfortable tests, but you figure it’s worth the time and trouble. After all, isn’t it best to err on the side of caution? If the test results are normal, it will put your mind at ease and keep you from stressing and worrying any further. Right? Well, not necessarily! The purpose of arecent systematic reviewwas to find out if patients in situations like the one above were indeed reassured after undergoing diagnostic testing. The review examined the results of 14 randomized controlled trials involving more than 3,820 people between the ages of 32 and 62 (1). All suffered some type of physical symptom (e.g. low back pain, headache) but none were at risk for any serious condition. The diagnostic tests assessed included x-rays, MRIs, scopes such as colonoscopies, as well as those that assess heart function. The studies showed that in both the short term (within three months of testing) and longer term (up to 18 months) diagnostic tests did nothing to reduce patients’ worry or anxiety about a potential illness. There was also no impact on how long the symptoms lasted. Testing may result in fewer additional visits to the doctor, however that evidence is weak. The study results may have important implications for future healthcare practices. Currently, about 17% of visits to the doctor, and more than a third of referrals to specialists, are for symptoms not caused by any serious illness (2). In such cases, medical professionals have to assess whether diagnostic tests are warranted (3) and in weighing the pros and cons, often order tests in the belief that they will reassure patients (4). So if you notice an unusual symptom, don’t ignore it, but don’t panic! Seek the sound advice of your doctor before assuming you need to undergo a battery of tests.']"

This is due to oral health promotion, disease prevention (e.g. use of fluoride toothpaste), and increased restorative oral care measures (e.g. dental implants). The percentage of individuals who have no natural teeth (edendulism) has drastically dropped in the last 2 decades going from 17% to 6.4% (1). Many seniors can now enjoy the benefit of having some or even most of their teeth. This allows them to eat a wide variety of good-tasting and nutritious foods.  Having the ability to properly chew food also ensures sufficient nutrient absorption and increased well-being, which cannot be achieved at the same level with dentures (2,3). Maintaining good oral health is of great importance. Indeed, neglected oral health may lead to pain, discomfort, and serious infection that could even result in hospitalisation. Moreover, mobile or missing teeth, loose dentures or partials, and presence of cavities are all factors that can be a barrier to communicating and having a social life. Associated with other health disorders, untreated oral diseases are a growing concern. Even more so with recent studies that have linked oral diseases to other diseases like type II diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and pulmonary infections (4,5,6,7). In addition, having regular oral check-ups increases the chances of early detection of oral cancers. Regular oral check-ups can also reduce morbidity and even mortality. (More information on oral cancer can be found at:https://www.canada.ca/en/public-health/services/oral-diseases-conditions/oral-cancer.html) Results from the Canadian Health Measure Survey (CHMS) have shown that more seniors are keeping their natural teeth longer and therefore have increased oral health care needs. The survey compared the percentage of adults with root decays aged 60-79 years of age to adults aged 20-59 years of age from the sample. The results showed that the number of root decays was almost three times higher in the older adults compared to the younger adults. The survey also showed a much higher rate of gum disease among the 60-79 age group. These higher rates of cavities and gum diseases can be attributed to many risk factors often associated with aging. We can sometimes notice a change in the diet pattern for soft and sticky food. Also, a reduction in the saliva flow, called xerostomia, has been identified as a side-effect in over 400 drugs. As we age we are more likely to be on such medications. Since the saliva flow has an important role in protecting the teeth from cavities, a lower flow can then result in higher risk of developing dental decays for many seniors taking medications.  Moreover, as we age, we can experience a reduction in dexterity and independence, which can impact the quality of flossing and brushing.  With more plaque present, there is a direct impact on gum diseases and an increased risk of dental decay. Having dental insurance coverage was found to be one of the main factors that determine whether Canadians see a dental professional for dental care. This is a matter of concern for many seniors who might lose their private dental insurance after they retire. Results from the CHMS show a constant decline of people with private dental insurance as they get older (60 to 79 years of age). In addition, seniors may over time modify their behaviour in regard to their dental care and opt to seek an oral health professional only on an emergency care basis (1). It is of great importance to start planning early for many aspects of your retirement. Maintaining your oral health care as you age should be part of your planning process. Poor oral health can impact your overall wellbeing in your 'golden years'. Adopting healthy oral health habits, like reducing your consumption of sugary foods and sweetened beverages, daily brushing and flossing of your teeth, and regular dental check-ups can go a long way in maintaining good oral health in your senior years. You should also start early to plan financially for your dental care needs and also let your family know of your desires in terms of your oral care in the eventuality you do not have the capacity to decide on your own. It's important to start planning early for your oral health care needs now so you can enjoy retirement in the future!""]"

Preventing injuries from falls is important in helping older adults experience a high quality of life, including independent living, engaging in healthy activities and enjoying social and recreational pursuits. One promising preventative measure involves exercise programs targeted to seniors. Arecentsystematic reviewanalyzed the results of 17 randomized controlled trials involving more than 4,300 older adults (average age of 77 years) to determine whether fall prevention exercise programs help to reduce different types of fall related injuries (2). Specific categories of injuries included those resulting in broken bones and those requiring hospitalization. The review found there was strong evidence that fall prevention exercise programs – delivered either in a group setting or at home – can help prevent falls, and injuries resulting from falls, in older adults living independently. While programs included several types of beneficial exercises such as strength and resistance training, exercises to improve balance were deemed the most effective in preventing falls (3;4;5;6). Many seniors look forward to retirement and the chance to do things they couldn’t when they were working and raising a family. But the fear of falling and sustaining a serious injury may hold them back. Well-designed exercise programs may be the key to ensuring older adults have the confidence and the ability to live active, healthy lives and pursue those dreams!']"

Notably, hearing loss may affect our social interactions and even place us at risk for other health problems, like dementia or falls. In this four part series, we examine the evidence for: In this first part, we look at auditory and cognitive changes in older adults who do not yet have clinically significant losses in either hearing or cognition (such as memory). How can changes in the ears and brain affect everyday communication and social interaction? As people get older, there are changes in the ear and changes in the brain networks that connect the ear to various parts of the brain. Recently, researchers have been trying to learn more about how the ear and brain work together and they have discovered some intriguing connections. Most people think that problems understanding speech in everyday conversations are only about our ears, but it turns out that our brain is involved as well. We need our brains to interpret the meaning of the sounds our ears are detecting. The continual mental or cognitive effort needed to listen can be stressful and reduce enjoyment of family gatherings and other social events. We need to understand more about how auditory and cognitive abilities change with age. Understanding these changes will give us insights into why so many older people complain of difficulties when they try to follow conversation, especially in noisy or busy group situations. Think about what it is like to listen to a conversation at a party. Problems hearing in noisy situations can make it difficult to understand, pay attention to and remember what others are saying during conversation in social situations like parties. Sometimes you can hear a sound without recognizing or understanding it, especially if you were not expecting it. For example, you might hear a strange rattling sound in your house. It takes you a while to figure out that it is coming from a broken shutter flapping in the wind. Or you might hear a person talking in a foreign language without understanding the meaning of the words. As you listen, you use your brain to make sense of the sounds you are hearing with your ears. Your understanding of what you have just heard and your expectations in the situation help you to understand what you will hear next. You also use your brain to decide how to react to the sounds you are hearing. You might hear a fire alarm using your ears. But you need to use your brain to decide that there is danger and to plan your escape route. People hear sounds whether they want to hear them or not. “Noise” refers to sounds that you don’t want to hear. For example, when you go out for dinner with your friend, you might find that it is interesting to eavesdrop on the person sitting next to you in the restaurant. The voice of the person sitting next to you is not noise. However, if you want to focus on what your friend is saying, then the voice of the person at the next table is noise because you would rather not hear it. When you are driving, the music playing on the radio or the sound of your car motor could be noise that interferes with paying attention to your passenger’s conversation. However, if you like the music playing on the radio in your car, or are worried that your car needs to be repaired, then the sound of your friend talking could be noise. You need your brain to ignore noise and pay attention to the sounds you want to hear. These choices depend on your goals in the situation and not simply on which sounds are entering your ears. Remembering what a person said will be much easier if: Again, the ears and the brain have to work together for the information coming into your ears to be stored in memory so that it can be used later. In their 40s, adults often begin to notice problems understanding speech, especially in noisy or busy situations. These problems usually increase gradually over years or decades before a clinically significant hearing loss is diagnosed. Some people will have more problems than other people because they may be developing different type(s) of age-related hearing loss (see Part 3). As adults age, there are also changes in cognition or how the brain works; some aspects of cognition get worse, but others get better (1). On the one hand, there are gradual cognitive declines over the adult lifespan in how well people process information. When people try to follow and understand a group conversation, they need to process the words that they hear. Fast and efficient processing of information, as in a conversation in a noisy room, involves hearing, but also understanding, focusing attention, and memory. Changes in the ear with age (auditory aging) can make it more difficult to listen. In turn, difficulty listening can reduce how efficiently the brain can understand, focus on and remember the information that was heard. In fact, people of any age have more difficulty understanding, focusing attention on and remembering when they listen in noisy situations compared to if they listen in a quiet situation. Importantly, the amount of noise that it takes to make listening difficult for an older adult is less than the amount that it takes to make listening difficult for a younger adult. Indeed, differences between younger and older adults on cognitive measures of comprehension or memory can be reduced or even eliminated if the listening conditions used during testing are adjusted so that it is equally difficult for younger and older adults to hear (2). It is possible for gains in some cognitive abilities to counter-act age-related declines in auditory information processing. There are gradual gains over the adult lifespan in knowledge of the world, linguistic knowledge (e.g., vocabulary), and other types of expertise. Even if hearing, focusing on and remembering information become progressively more difficult over the years, older adults can use their experience and knowledge to advantage when they listen. In other words, improved ability to use context and knowledge of the world can help an older listener to compensate. By compensating, older adults can continue to be successful in conversations and social interactions. This is especially the case in familiar situations where their knowledge can be a real strength. For example, being familiar with the topic being discussed can help a listener to compensate for difficulty hearing in noise. Compared to younger adults, older adults tend to rely more on their knowledge of the context and less on precisely hearing the sounds of speech. By using knowledge to compensate when it is difficult to follow conversation in noise, older adults may need to increase brain activity more than a younger adult would need to do . In the long term, in older adults who develop clinically significant hearing loss, there can be permanent changes in brain activation patterns and clinically significant cognitive declines may result (see Part 2). By solving hearing problems (see Part 4), you could make it easier to understand, focus your attention on and remember what you hear and in this way you will be taking some of the load off of your brain. In this four-part blog post series we cover various aspects of hearing loss:']"

The ear and the connections between the ear and the brain are especially important for understanding speech in noisy and busy everyday situations. When trying to follow conversation, the hearing problems of older adults can make it harder for their brains to process information. By drawing on the life-time of knowledge that is an asset for older listeners, the brain can also make it easier to follow a familiar topic. Taking advantage of knowledge to understand conversation happens even if the ears are not precisely hearing all of the sounds of a talker’s speech. Older adults activate their brains differently from younger adults when they are trying to follow conversations in daily life. In the long term, older adults who develop clinically significant hearing loss may also develop changes in how they use their brain for listening in daily life. Such permanent changes in brain activation patterns could even be related to clinically significant cognitive declines (such as memory declines). Hearing loss may be a sign to older adults that there is more going on with their overall health. Recent epidemiological studies found an association between hearing loss and the onset of future dementia (1-7). Other recent epidemiological studies also suggest that there is an association between hearing loss and other serious health issues spanning mental health (8), physical health (9;10), falls (11), and even mortality (12-14). Although the reasons for these associations are not yet known and the results do not show that hearing loss causes dementia, it seems that people with hearing problems might need to be even more aware of what they can do to stay healthy. In Part 2, we cover recent research suggesting that people with hearing loss may be at greater risk of developing dementia. In their 40s, people can start to experience more difficulty listening when it is noisy, even if listening in quiet situations is still easy. The most common way to define hearing loss is by measuring hearing thresholds (see Part 3). As we age, hearing loss increases gradually and it is one of the top three most common chronic disabilities in older adults (15). By the age of 65 years, about a 1/3 people have a clinically significant hearing loss, by the age of 75 years about half are affected, and by the age of 80 most people are affected (16). As people get older, an increasing number will also develop clinically significant cognitive declines. These can include mild cognitive impairment or various types of dementia, of which Alzheimer’s disease is the most common. In dementia, changes in the brain are above and beyond the ‘normal’ changes in the brain that come with age. By the age of 70 years, about 1/5 of people will have a clinically  significant cognitive decline (for example memory declines) due to abnormal changes in the brain (17). A growing body of epidemiological research suggests that hearing loss is more common in older people with dementia than in those with normal cognition. This research also shows that people with hearing loss are more likely to develop cognitive declines compared to people with good hearing (4;5;18-20). Indeed, some studies found that individuals with hearing loss had 2 to 5 times increased risk of developing dementia (21). In addition, for every 10 decibels (dB) increase in hearing loss individuals had a 20% increase in their risk of developing dementia (1). In Part 1, we discussed how difficulty hearing could reduce performance on cognitive tests, such as tests of memory. Do people with hearing loss do worse on cognitive tests just because they don’t hear well during the test? Many of the tests used to diagnose dementia do involve listening to instructions. As well, some test items used to diagnose dementia involve remembering words and sentences after hearing them. It may be that the deficits on a cognitive test observed in people with hearing problems may be exaggerated. The health professional who is doing the cognitive test and the person who is being tested need to realize that part of the explanation for some of the test results could be difficulty hearing. If you think you might have some hearing loss, it would be a very good idea to have your hearing tested before going for cognitive testing. If you know that you have some hearing loss, then it is important to share this information with your doctor and other health professionals who are assessing your cognitive abilities. You should let them know if the test room is too noisy for you or if you need to use a hearing aid or other technology to ensure that you are hearing as well as possible during the test. Wearing your glasses will also help you to see better! Seeing better will help you to during tests using pictures or print materials and watching the face of the tester will make it easier for you to understand what the tester is saying. But hearing problems are not the reason for all cognitive (memory) problems. The research discussed here in Part 2, indicates that hearing loss is associated with cognitive declines. This association occurs even for cognitive tests that do not require the person being tested to hear test items (for example, when memory for visual items is tested). More research is needed to discover the reasons for the links between hearing loss and cognitive loss (22). Some preliminary research evidence suggests that hearing rehabilitation (such as wearing a hearing aid or having therapy) could contribute to good cognitive health (23). However, strong studies to test the link between improving one’s hearing and improving one’s cognition are just beginning. We do not yet know if there is something we can do about hearing loss that would prevent or minimize cognitive changes. In the meantime, having your hearing checked and seeking help for hearing problems as soon as possible seem to be good ideas. Hearing loss can have wide-ranging effects on social, mental and physical health. As hearing loss progresses, eventually, people may avoid difficult listening situations by staying at home and going out less often. Importantly, promising results have been found in research investigating lifestyle factors that could increase cognitive resources (or ‘reserves’) (24). These benefits seem to result from increased social, mental and physical activities, such as being involved in social leisure activities (25), doing regular physical exercise and/or eating a healthy diet (26), or developing specialized cognitive skills or expertise such as speaking a second language (27) or playing a musical instrument (28). One of the possible explanations for the connection between hearing loss and earlier or faster cognitive decline is that people with hearing loss are less active. Thus, is will be important for researchers to learn more about how hearing rehabilitation might help older adults to remain active and healthy. People often wait ten or more years after they first notice hearing problems before they seek help from health care professionals. It may be advantageous to get help for hearing problems sooner rather than later. That is, you should seek help for your hearing loss before you stop being active and your quality of life is affected (29).

Whatâs that again? What does an audiogram tells you about your hearing and what doesnât it tell you?","['Many of us begin to experience difficulties hearing as we age. It may seem like other people are mumbling or that it is easy to hear in some situations but almost impossible in other situations. In Parts 1 and 2, we discussed aging-related hearing loss, and how the ear and the brain work together to listen in everyday life. In Part 3, we discuss what the results of a basic hearing test, an audiogram, can or cannot tell you about your hearing difficulties and why. The audiogram will tell you your hearing thresholds. A hearing threshold is the quietest sound (measured in decibels hearing level (dB HL)) at which you can hear a sound. The sound of a pin drop would be near the hearing threshold of a person with good hearing. During a basic hearing test, thresholds are measured for tones at different frequencies (measured in Hertz or cycles per second) that cover a range of five octaves. You can think of the frequencies of the tones used in the test as different notes played on a piano keyboard. Different frequencies have different pitches; like piano notes, some have a lower pitch (more bass) and some have a higher pitch (more treble). The results of the basic hearing test are plotted for each ear on a graph called an audiogram. According to the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Figure 1a and 1b shows the typical audiograms for women and men at different ages (1). Compared to these typical audiograms, half of the population would have better hearing thresholds; that is, their thresholds would fall above the line for a specific age and gender group. People who can hear very quiet sounds would have thresholds near the top of the audiogram. Similarly, half the population would have poorer hearing thresholds; that is, their results would fall below the line for a specific age and gender group. People who cannot hear sounds until the sounds are louder would have thresholds nearer to the bottom of the audiogram. If you have had a hearing test, you could compare your own audiogram to the ISO curve for you own age and gender group to see if your thresholds are better or worse. As we age, hearing thresholds at the higher frequencies usually change more than thresholds at lower frequencies. That is, we usually do not hear high-frequency (treble) sounds as well as low-frequency (bass) sounds. This means that it takes more decibels to make high-frequency (treble) sounds loud enough for older people to hear them. Quiet, high-frequency sounds like a clock ticking or a bird chirping might become impossible to hear. Hearing loss at higher frequencies is common and some might consider this type of hearing loss to be ‘normal’ for older adults. However, the definition of normal hearing used by the World Health Organization is not adjusted for age (2). Hearing is considered to be clinically normal if thresholds are between 0 and 25 dB HL. The green section (top of Figure 1a) shows the normal hearing range. If your threshold is in the green box then it is normal. If you are like many other older people then you might have normal thresholds at lower frequencies but not at higher frequencies. The red line on Figure 1a shows that a typical 70-year old woman would have high-frequency hearing thresholds that are worse than the clinically normal range (below the green box). This is the case, even though her hearing thresholds are typical for her age and gender. This means that you might have typical hearing for your age and gender, but your thresholds might not be as good as a younger person and they might not be considered to be clinically normal. Thresholds on an audiogram can be interpreted as follows: Figure 1: Audiograms of women in top panel and men in bottom panel (adapted from the International Organization of Standardization (1)). Conversation is a lot louder than a pin drop. The blue line on audiogram in Figure 1a and 1b shows that the average level of conversation is around 45 dB HL, This means that people who have normal hearing thresholds have no difficulty hearing conversation because it is plenty louder than their hearing thresholds. Speech sounds will be heard but only faintly by people with mild hearing loss. Speech sounds may not be heard at all by people with a moderate or greater hearing loss. Older people who have typical age-related hearing loss, with poorer thresholds in the higher frequencies, may hear some speech sounds well but not hear other speech sounds at all. The most difficult speech sounds to hear are consonants (e.g., p, f, t, k) because these speech sounds rely more on higher frequencies. Vowels are easier to hear because they rely more on lower frequencies. Older adults will often complain that  “I hear people talking but the voices are not clear and it is hard to understand what they are saying”. Although people with hearing loss often blame other people for mumbling, a more likely explanation is that an older person with a typical high-frequency hearing loss can only hear some speech sounds and misses other speech sounds when people are talking. Although the audiogram is a good test for measuring the quietest sounds you can hear, the hearing problems of older adults are often not fully explained by the audiogram. Even when sounds are loud enough, and even if older adults have normal audiograms, it is still common for them to complain about hearing problems, especially when they are trying to listen in busy, noisy, or group situations. To understand why people have trouble hearing even when sounds are loud enough, we have to know more about what goes wrong in the auditory (hearing) system as people age. Researchers have realized for a long time that aging can result in different types of hearing loss (3). Carefully controlled research on animals has provided evidence for three types of hearing loss that could worsen with age (4). Two types result in poorer thresholds for high-frequency sounds and could explain the changes in the audiogram discussed earlier. Type 1: In the first type, the outer hair cells in the inner ear are damaged. This damage occurs usually by being exposed to environmental factors such as very high noise levels. Younger adults who work in industrial noise can also get this type of hearing loss. Type 2: The second type involves changes in the blood supply to the inner ear that alter its chemistry. These chemical changes in the ear have been compared to a battery going flat (5). This type only occurs in older adults. Type 3: The third type involves damage to the nerves connecting the ear to the brain. Recent evidence suggests that lifelong exposure to noise can cause neural damage to the auditory nerves. This nerve damage disrupts the way in which information from the ear is delivered to the brain (1). Such damage can occur even if the noise is not loud enough to permanently change hearing thresholds. As people age, they often develop a combination of the three types of age-related hearing loss, but Type 3, neural damage, might not be detected by the audiogram. Speak to your doctor if your audiogram appears normal for your age but you are still having problems hearing in daily life. Of course, one of the problems with high-frequency hearing loss is that some sounds simply cannot be heard. Making sounds louder (for example, by using a hearing aid) will help to bring sounds back into the audible range. In general, it is better to hear sounds than not to hear them. However, some people, especially those with the first type of age-related hearing loss described above (Type 1: damage to the outer hair cells in the inner ear), may actually become less able to tolerate loud sounds. This means that the hearing aid circuits need to make sounds loud enough but also protect the hearing aid wearer from sounds that are too loud. In addition, for most people with hearing loss, making sounds loud enough to hear does not necessarily make sounds clearer. The clarity of sound can be reduced because the ear can no longer analyze sounds properly. It is common to have difficulties picking out one sound when many sounds are heard at the same time. For people who have the third type of age-related hearing loss described above (Type 3: neural damage), problems with reduced clarity and the feeling that sounds are jumbled together can happen even if the person’s audiogram is normal. Making sounds louder will not solve all listening problems, especially those resulting from neural damage. These problems are less about loudness and more about the how well the signals are sent from the ears to the brain. The good news is that, even if making sounds louder is not enough, other solutions might help solve the problems that many older listeners have in daily life (see Part 4).

The audiogram (a chart showing your hearing test results) is used to decide if you are missing important sounds and if making sounds louder might help you to hear better. However, the audiogram alone does not tell enough about the kinds of problems people might still be having when sounds are loud enough. Even when hearing thresholds are in the clinically normal range, and even when people with hearing loss use hearing aids, there can still be problems due to damage to the nerves that connect the ears and the brain. Deciding when to seek help may depend less on the audiogram and more on when an individual realizes that hearing problems are beginning to hamper their activities and relationships with other people. A recent study of non-auditory factors associated with success with hearing aids found that success was greater for people who: If you have begun to notice that hearing problems make you feel that then it is probably time to think about getting help. You may also want to think about getting help if your family, friends or co-workers have begun to notice that you are having trouble hearing or if they are having trouble enjoying activities with you because of your hearing problems. It will be easier for you to find solutions for your hearing problems if they are willing to support you in getting help. If you need sounds to be louder, then hearing aids could be a useful solution. Progress continues to be made in designing hearing aids to help people hear better in noisy situations, but many hearing aid wearers still find it difficult to hear clearly, especially when they are in busy or noisy situations. But for problems related to clarity and understanding speech and noise, other solutions besides hearing aids can help. These other solutions should be considered, whether or not you try a hearing aid. Options should be selected based not only on your audiogram, but also on your communication needs. Your communication needs depend on the people and the situations where you need to use your hearing. If you are having trouble hearing in your everyday activities then the first step is to think about which problems matter the most to you. When, where and with whom are you having hearing problems that you would like solve? Once you have a clear idea about your goals for improving your hearing, then having a hearing test is the next step. After your audiogram is completed, a hearing health care professional, such as an audiologist, will be able make recommendations regarding options for improving hearing and solving hearing problems to achieve your goals. These options will likely include a combination of changing communication behaviours, using communication technologies, and modifying and selecting communication situations or environments: As a person with a hearing problem, you can make changes to your communication behaviours. For example, communication behaviours can include being sure to watch the faces and gestures of people who are talking to you. Taking advantage of visual information will make it easier to understand what you are hearing. Your family members, friends, co-workers and others can also learn to change how they behave during communication. It can be very helpful if they make sure to get your attention before speaking to you. By working together, misunderstandings can be prevented or repaired quickly without disrupting your conversations with each other. Hearing aids can be used in a wide range of situations. It may also be helpful to use specialized devices instead of or in addition to hearing aids. There are many specialized ‘assistive’ devices for listening in specific challenging situations. These specialized devices can help when you are using the telephone, watching television, or attending events in public places such as theatres or places of worship. For example, by using headphones and your own wireless amplifying system for the television you could avoid arguments with your family about turning the television up too loud. To comply with laws about making public places accessible to people with disabilities, just like ramps and elevators are available for people in wheelchairs, theatres and places of worship often provide visitors who have hearing loss with hearing assistive systems that can be used to help them hear better when they are attending events at the facility. These assistive devices can be used whether or not you have a hearing aid. Hearing health professionals, such as audiologists, can advise you on your rights and what might work for you in the situations where you need help. Environmental solutions involve learning how to select or modify places to minimize listening difficulties. This can include reducing noise (for example, turning down the background music), minimizing distractions in your home or office, or selecting stores, restaurants or other public places that are quieter if you want to be able to hear and converse more easily. New standards for sound environments in health care facilities are currently guiding the design of public places such as hospitals.

We all wear many “hats” at any given point but like it or not, the role we play in our jobs and careers is a significant one in helping to define who we are to others, and even to ourselves. What happens then once we retire? It isn’t unusual for newly retired people – even those who have been looking forward to this phase of their lives – to report a loss of status leading to feelings of disconnection, aimlessness and loss of identity.(1)\xa0 Several studies have shown that maintaining active social relationships after retirement is closely associated with better health and a longer, more satisfying life.(2,3) But what isn’t so clear is what aspects of social relations are important and what can be done to encourage beneficial social roles among older adults. In an attempt to shed light on these issues, a comprehensivesystematic reviewlooked at different kinds of interventions designed to provide meaningful and socially engaging activities for people during their transition to retirement.(4) The review specifically reported on how effective the interventions were in improving senior’s perception of social roles and whether identifying with these roles resulted in improved health or well-being. The review reported results of 11 separate studies conducted over a significant span of time (1965 to 2009) and evaluated seven unique interventions including volunteer or paid participation in activities such as mentoring, child minding, personal development through continuing education, and park maintenance. While the quality of the studies included in the review could be better, almost all of the studies reported positive outcomes such as: enhanced life satisfaction, greater sociability, more confidence, improved cognition, and greater perceived health and physical activity among those who received the intervention. Retirement should be a welcome and well deserved reward for years of effort and accomplishments – at work and at home. But for some, it can trigger feelings of loss and emptiness. For optimal health and well-being, it is important for retirees to adopt new social roles that are both meaningful and enjoyable so they can answer the ‘what do you do?’ question with pride and passion.']"

Vitamin D is equally important to the development of dense, healthy bones (2) as it makes it possible for our bodies to absorb the much needed calcium (3). So it stands to reason that - taken together -\xa0calcium and vitamin D have the potential to be a powerful tag team when it comes to keeping bones healthy and strong throughout our lifetime and ideally, resistant to breaks. According to several studies conducted since the early 1990s, these supplements help to reduce fractures a small degree in women over the age of 65 (4). That was of some solace to older women: since they lose bone mass at a faster rate than men, they’re even more likely to suffer broken bones (5). But supplements cost money. Is it worth it to take vitamin D + calcium? Asystematic reviewof 53 studiesfound reliable evidence that vitamin D with calcium taken regularly slightly reduces the chance of hip and other fractures in older men and women, whether they live in the community or institutional settings (6). And calcium plays a key role: taking vitamin Dwithoutcalcium does not appear to provide the same benefits for bone health. Most trials used a dose of 400 - 800 IU vitamin D3 daily with 1000mg calcium. Even more recently, the National Osteoporosis Foundation’s analysis of eightrandomized controlled trialsshowed statistically significant improvements (15% reduced risk of total fractures and 30% reduced risk of hip fractures) with vitamin D + calcium supplements (7). These results were also significant for both men and women living in the community or in institutional facilities. In other words, the calcium/vitamin D combo would appear to be a good first line of defense for many older adults seeking to avoid broken bones. As always, check with your doctor before taking any new medications or supplements, including vitamins. The risks of these supplements may outweigh the benefits for people with (or at risk of) kidney stones or kidney disease, high blood calcium levels, gastrointestinal disease or heart disease (6). More research is also needed about the effectiveness of vitamin D + calcium supplements for people with chronic illnesses and people with different levels of sun exposure.

The quality of oral health among seniors points to neglect and shows we need to 'brush up' on mouth care,"[""The importance of brushing your teeth is highly under-rated. In fact not brushing your teeth or maintaining good oral hygiene puts you at risk for serious health complications. This blog discusses the reasons why oral health is important as we age and why neglecting the oral health of older adults, especially in long term care homes (LTCH), can be considered a form of elder abuse. The #1 cause of death in LTCH residents is pneumonia and the link with oral health is well known (1;2)!  Pneumonia can be acquired when bacteria laden secretions travel to the lungs. There is an accumulation of bacteria in the dental plaque and this bacteria sits in the mouth, teeth (including dentures), oral mucosa, and under the gums,. The bacteria can easily travel to the respiratory tract and can become pneumonia. There is also evidence that maintaining adequate oral hygiene can prevent pneumonia (3;4). Approximately one in 10 cases of death from pneumonia in LTCH residents may be prevented by improving oral hygiene (3). This clearly supports the belief of most dentists, dental hygienists, and other health professionals that brushing your teeth may indeed save lives! But what if you are unable to brush your teeth? What if you are unable to do a proper cleaning for the recommended 'two minutes a day, twice a day, especially after meals'. This is the situation for many older adults, particularly those living in LTCH. Some estimates suggest that oral diseases affect over 95 percent of Canadian adults (5;6). Older adults are at particularly high risk for oral health problems, and poor oral health in seniors has been linked to general systemic health risks, such as cardiovascular disease, stroke, poor nutrition, glycemic control in people with diabetes and respiratory infection (7;8).  Despite this growing body of evidence, the mouth seems to be forgotten and neglected.  The oral cavity generally seems to be relegated to the realm of the dentist, and many residents living in LTCH typically never get seen by one or at the very best seen infrequently.  The potential for creating additional health problems because of this lack of emphasis on oral care is significant. As we age, we have greater changes in our teeth and gums which require more care rather than less (7). As well, older adults have greater challenges with: Typically many medications (over 400 types) can cause dry mouth; this problem is made worse in many older adults who may be on several medications. As well, our teeth and mouth require more attention rather than less as we age. Unfortunately, this attention is not provided in most acute and long term care hospitals. Studies have shown (9) that there were missed nursing- care opportunities with regards to mouth care in acute care hospitals. The issue of oral care becomes a greater health problem in LTCH. Older adults are living in LTCH because they require greater assistance with personal care. Although the care providers in LTCH are tasked with performing many personal care activities, it seems that oral care tends to get neglected (8). As a dentist who has spent over a decade visiting over 140 LTCH and acute care hospitals treating older adults, I have learned much about the degree of oral care provided. Surprisingly, little time is allotted to oral hygiene. I have often wondered if there is an examination and assessment of the oral cavity upon admission to the LTCH and who is responsible for this. When visiting seniors in LTCH, I look for the daily regimen and checklist that shows the degree of oral health care a resident is receiving. This checklist is often difficult to find or not well documented. From a dentist's perspective, this care plan is as critical and life-saving as delivering medications to prevent serious health problems, such as pneumonia. Inconsistent oral care in LTCH is associated with the lack of: There are some challenges for staff and residents in LTCH in establishing consistent and adequate oral health care. Fear, perceived difficulty, lack of knowledge, uncooperative residents, lack of supplies, lack of time, and lack of staff are reported as barriers to oral care (8). The training for health care aids and for nursing staff, until recently, has been very limited with regards to oral care generally, but even less so for this care in the elderly (8;10). As a dentist, I often find that other health care professionals don't understand the adverse effects of medications on the oral cavity (or the severe consequences of dry mouth). Nor can they identify problems in the mouth or understand the effects that fractured/broken teeth can have on one's health. A secondary problem is that there are limited preventative guidelines or referral guidelines for health care workers to follow when it comes to oral health. Currently, no extensively tested evidence-based oral care protocols exist for the institutionalized elderly (8). Moreover, even within the dental profession itself, practice guidelines have not been fully developed or implemented (8).  Even if these guidelines existed, typically frontline staff (nurses and health care aides) may not have appropriate tools to examine or treat the mouth; nor are they trained in how to use these tools. The problem becomes more difficult with residents who have dementia. How do you help someone with brushing their teeth when they are resistant to care because of confusion or cognitive changes? A pilot study using the 'Managing Oral Hygiene using Threat Reduction (MOUTh)' approach has shown some promising results. The MOUTh approach gives those providing care a method to deliver oral hygiene in older adults who resist help (11). Nevertheless, health care providers in LTCH need clear guidance and documented plans to assist with these challenging situations. A final problem is that residents in LTCH are often not evaluated by a dentist nor have their teeth cleaned by a hygienist on a regular basis. Dentists and dental hygienists, as experts in the care of the mouth and teeth, should be part of the healthcare team. Many health care providers don't seem to link oral health with the serious risk for poor health outcomes. If health care workers are not trained in understanding issues related to oral health, they are not likely to prioritize it relative to other care activities.  There also a need to stress the serious nature of some oral health problems. For example, most adults should recognize that healthy gums never bleed, and should seek dental care if they had this problem. Similarly, when health care providers see residents with bleeding gums, they should understand that this is a concerning health problem. If a doctor saw a cut or a wound on a patient that continued to bleed, they would surely seek to stop the bleeding. However, if a resident's gums continue to bleed, there seems to be a lack of understanding that this is equally serious. There is also a tendency to forget to consider the mouth as a possible source for other care concerns. For example, if a resident is not eating, care providers may not consider evaluating the resident's mouth as a possible source of the problem.  Perceptions become realities and there is a huge perception that residents, their caregivers and health care providers do not perceive dental care as a necessary part of daily care.  Likely, the way in which caregivers prioritize dental care may be directly related to their own beliefs and culture.  As a dentist, my message to residents, families, and health care providers is that oral care is a basic and necessary care for everyone and of every age, especially as we age. All of us need to 'brush up' on mouth care, as our health and life depend on it. Thus far, we have seen that residents of LTCH may not receive adequate oral hygiene or dental care for a variety of reasons.  For the residents to enjoy better health, comfort, confidence, quality of life and personal dignity good oral hygiene is essential.  If it is neglected it leads to pain, eating problems, speech difficulties, bad breath and poor appearance. More importantly, we can see that it can also lead to serious health concerns and even death. So how is this lack of oral hygiene and dental care related to elder abuse and neglect?  We have defined dental elder abuse as 'when a person or a system prevents a person from receiving necessary basic oral care' (12;13). Until recently, there has been a lack of recognition and definition of elder abuse related to oral hygiene.  Caregivers of older adults often neglect oral health and may inadvertently be exposing their loved ones to abuse. Very little is known about the magnitude of this type of abuse because most have not linked oral health to neglect and abuse. For this reason we have started a new initiative to investigate this type of abuse (12;13). In the near future we hope to have more information about elder neglect and abuse in the context of oral hygiene. So how can I turn your frown upside down as you read this?  We can decrease the risk of pneumonia and other health problems in LTCH by providing good oral hygiene. We need to increase awareness at all levels that providing daily and comprehensive oral care is a basic care necessity. Daily oral care regimens need to be adhered to and we need to assist front line staff by providing better training and including dentists and dental hygienists as part of the team. Preventing neglect of oral health is not only a health issue but it is also an ethical issue. Neglect of a person's oral health can be considered elder abuse in some situations.""]"

No doubt you’ve heard, said or wondered that countless times in recent years. The internet has forever changed the way we learn and function in the world. More than 85% of Canadians have access to the internet (1), largely through home computers and/or other electronic devices, and use it to communicate, be entertained and get information on pretty much any topic. In a society where all we have to do is “Google it,” there’s no need to wonder long about anything! That has exciting implications for healthcare. With rising costs, limited resources and other challenges facing our healthcare system, disease prevention through public education is vital.  Computers and the internet offer cost effective ways to inform people about health issues and encourage behaviours that help prevent disease and promote good health. Additional advantages of computer-delivered healthcare interventions are that they are available 24 hours a day, accessible to everyone (including those living in hard-to-reach locations) and can be tailored to individuals’ needs – which has been shown to greatly increase their effectiveness (2). The question remains however, do they work? Are they effective in helping people change potentially harmful behaviours and take steps toward healthier lifestyles? Awell-done analysisof 75 randomized controlled trials conducted over a 19-year period (3) sought to find out. More than 35,600 research participants (primarily adult women) completed one of several different types of computer-delivered information programs, most of them customized to their health needs and interests. The studies showed that computer-delivered interventions are at least somewhat effective in improving health-related knowledge, attitudes and intentions. They also have a modest effect on altering behaviours (in areas including nutrition, tobacco and other substance use, binging/purging and safe sexual practices) to improve health. While the results appear to be modest, from a public health perspective, they are meaningful at the population level (4) and support the continued development of high quality computer-delivered health information programs. Additional high quality research also shows that mindfulness-based programs delivered online or through smartphones apps for 2 – 12 weeks, lead to moderate improvements in stress and small improvements in depression, anxiety, and well-being in adults (5). If you enjoy spending time on the computer, you may be doing yourself some good – especially if you’re learning about how to ensure a long and healthy life.']"

Occasional memory lapses are a natural part of the aging process and do not necessarily signal the onset of dementia, characterized by a progressive decline in mental abilities and the eventual reliance on caregivers for help completing everyday tasks. Somewhere in the middle between normal age-related forgetfulness and dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease, is mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Approximately 19% of adults over the age of 65 are diagnosed with this condition.(1) They may have some noticeable difficulties with memory, thinking, language and/or judgement, but the problems aren’t generally serious enough to interfere with daily living.(2) However what is worrisome is that close to half of those diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment will develop dementia within three years, compared with 3% of the population of the same age without this diagnosis.(3) For that reason, people with MCI have been the focus of recent studies to determine whether proactive treatment can prevent dementia from developing. A2013 systematic review, comprising 41 randomized controlled trials and more than 7,800 participants, is one of the first to examine the effects of various treatments on people with MCI.(4) The primary treatment involved a category of medications called “cholinesterase inhibitors.” These drugs, known by trade names such as Aricept and Exelon, are currently used to treat symptoms in people with Alzheimer’s disease. Other interventions included vitamins, exercise and memory training. Disappointingly, the studies included in the review indicated that cholinesterase inhibitors do not improve symptoms in people with mild cognitive impairment, nor do they prevent the onset of dementia. There was no strong evidence that any of the other interventions examined were effective in improving cognitive function or preventing further declines. The review highlights the need for further study and research into alternate therapies.']"

Studies have shown a link between our walking speed, how well we move and how long we live (1;2). In this second part of this series we discuss how to improve your walking speed. As we age our walking gets: Our posture may not be upright and flexible (4), and together with decreased vision and hearing, this makes it harder for us to respond to our environment when we are walking. However, these changes need not limit you. If we notice that we are getting slower in our walking here are some strategies we can use to maintain an efficient walking speed (4;5). There are TWO approaches to improving your walking speed. The first approach addresses the structural changes we are experiencing in our body as we age. It is important to find ways to improve these structural changes; these body parts are the necessary 'machinery' we need to walk.  These structural changes include changes in muscle strength in our legs and in our trunk which we need to stabilize ourselves as we walk (6;7). We also need our joints to be flexible so the muscles can move our limbs efficiently, for example, in the length of the steps we take when we walk (8). Changes we might notice in our body structures could include, being unable to  extend your leg behind you in order to step forwards, or difficulty standing on your legs for longer periods (9) or difficulty lifting your foot as you swing your leg forwards. Onesystematic reviewand oneumbrella reviewfound that exercise interventions can improve walking speed and measures of physical function in frail older adults (10;11). Anothersystematic reviewof studies in healthy older adults found that resistance training to strengthen the leg muscles was the most effective way to improve gait speed (12).Table 1 below provides a summary of exercises that have been shown to improve body structures for walking more efficiently. The second approach to improving your walking speed involves the training of your brain to walk more efficiently. We can improve our walking by practicing, which restores the brain pattern used to engage the muscles and nerves to better meet the demands made by walking (19). We also need a basic level of fitness, involving our cardiorespiratory system, to walk efficiently. This means we do not experience breathlessness as we walk and there is efficient delivery of oxygen to the muscles. If walking takes a lot of energy, you will do it less often compared to persons who don't feel tired when they walk. Improvements in walking occur when our brains, muscles, joints and nerves respond more efficiently to meet the demands of walking (20;21).  Skilled walkers tend to have an efficient approach to walking and are more likely to walk more and experience less difficulty with moving generally (22). Two studies which included mostly older adults who either had mild (23) or moderate (24) problems with walking have evaluated this problem. These studies showed that exercise interventions that focused on walking activities resulted in greater improvements in walking speed compared to those that focused on structural issues such as strengthening and flexibility alone. Table 2 shows the best way to improve your walking efficiency. Our overall walking patterns also can be improved by practice. Practice will increase our walking skill, taking less energy to walk, and making it easier to make responses to our environment while we walk. Research shows that our walking speed is an important indicator of our health.  In this blog we have identified two approaches that research shows can improve your walking speed. We need to strengthen our body structures used in walking. We also need to practice walking while doing different activities, which improves the control the brain has on our walking and makes our walking more efficient. There is scientific evidence that improvements in gait speed over 1 year were associated with improved survival 8 years later (2). It is not known whether these exercise regimes to increase walking speed prevent us having problems with moving as we age or increase our life expectancy. You can continue to measure your walking speed from time to time with the instructions from part 1 of this blog series on walking speed. In this two-part series of blog posts on walking speed we look at what you need to know and how to improve your walking speed. InPart 1, we look at some of the basics and a simple test you can do to determine your walking speed. In Part 2, we discuss how to improve your walking speed.""]"

Although almost everyone has experienced a common cold, researchers can't always measure how widespread the problem is. This is because most of us suffer through a cold without seeking treatment unless the symptoms (which might include a persistent cough, red nose, sneezing, and fever) become severe. The best solution for the common cold is prevention. The popular media portrays many options and friends and family often make suggestions such as eating raw garlic or taking different vitamins and herbal supplements. But what (if anything) actually works to help prevent the common cold? The study of vitamin C became popular after Linus Pauling, a Nobel Laureate in chemistry, claimed that it prevented many different diseases, including the common cold. Vitamin C is believed to have protective effects on body cells when there is an infection, reducing the risk of infections as well as their severity. A high quality systematic review (1) including 29 studies involving 11,306 participants evaluated three impacts of vitamin C on the common cold: Regular supplement to prevent the common cold Regular supplement to reduce the duration and severity of symptoms, and Treatment, to improve how long people experience symptoms and how sick they feel once they catch a cold The studies evaluating prevention showed that adults taking vitamin C supplements daily (doses ranged from 200 mg to 2000 mg) did not report fewer colds compared to people taking a placebo. There was one small exception to this finding. The review found that people who do regular and intense physical exercise in cold weather (soldiers, skiers, marathon runners) and take vitamin C regularly did have a 48% decrease in the frequency of colds. However, an average older adult who doesn't exercise as intensely may not experience the benefits seen in people doing this type of intense training. The research findings do suggest that taking vitamin C regularly as a supplement can decrease the number of days you feel sick. If the average cold lasts 8 to 10 days then you will feel like your cold has stopped about one day sooner when you take vitamin C regularly, and your symptoms may not be as severe. A smaller number of studies measured vitamin C as a treatment after coming down with cold symptoms and found it is unlikely to make a difference to the length of time you feel sick (duration) or how sick you feel (severity). In two studies the participants took 'mega' doses of vitamin C (6000 to 8000 mg) at the start of the cold. The findings suggest that taking a higher dose may decrease the duration of a cold by about half a day. However, more research is needed to be fully convinced and there is some uncertainty about whether the benefits outweigh potential side effects of taking larger doses of vitamin C. There is still controversy around this issue. Although the benefit is small, some researchers suggest that it may be worthwhile to take vitamin C regularly as a supplement (1, 2). They argue that it is inexpensive and may be helpful for some individuals (2). The research studies varied greatly with respect to the length of time that people took vitamin C (from 2 weeks to 5 years). More research will help to evaluate if taking vitamin C for different lengths of time will produce the same results.""]"

You recently watched a group of seniors walking with poles. It seemed an odd sight, walking with ski poles in seasons with no snow. You discover that this form of walking is known as Nordic walking. Nordic walking is currently being promoted in seniors centres as a safe and very effective exercise, particularly suited to seniors. Nordic walking is a type of walking using poles that look similar to those used in cross country skiing.  This form of walking exercise originated in Finland where it was developed as a summer conditioning program for cross-country skiers. It quickly became popular not only in the Scandinavian countries, but in Europe and more recently in North America. This type of walking is also called 'urban poling' or 'exersliding'. The sports industry noticed this form of outdoor exercise and developed different types of poles to be used for this type of walking exercise. Nordic walking involves not only the muscles from your lower body but also those from your arms and upper back in order to move the poles.  The swinging motion of the poles and your legs will feel natural once you get the motion of the poles right. Learning to use the poles properly takes a little practice. The aim is to develop a rhythm that works best for you. While walking, one uses one's arms to help push forward when taking a stride. This is similar to cross-country skiing, where the poles are placed behind you as you move forward. Nordic exercise is currently being promoted as a form of walking exercise that has greater benefits than regular walking. The research showing the benefits and advantages of Nordic walking is increasing in both healthy individuals and for people with chronic conditions. When compared with regular walking, the scientific evidence suggests that Nordic walking has additional benefits because it: A recent study demonstrated that Nordic walking provided the best overall fitness (including cardiovascular fitness and strength and flexibility) relative to usual walking, resistance training or no exercise in community dwelling seniors (3).  It is likely that the use of poles decreases the impact on joints in the legs. However, pilot research suggests that there is no difference on the forces in the knee joints between Nordic or regular walking (4). There are several other advantages attributed to Nordic walking in the popular media, for example, improving balance, decreasing pain and muscle tension in the neck and shoulder region. However, the research to support these additional claims has not yet been undertaken.  While the research is ongoing, we ought not to forget that Nordic walking at the very least still has the benefits of regular walking. These include physical and mental health benefits. There is limited research on injuries associated with Nordic walking. In one study (5) 137 healthy experienced Nordic walkers were surveyed about injuries. The mostly middle-aged Nordic walkers logging over 29,000 hours of walking, showed rates of injuries that were less than 1 per 1000 hours of training.  The most common injury reported by Nordic walkers is a strain of the ligament on the inside of the thumb after falling (0.2 per 1000 hours). The most serious injury was a shoulder dislocation related to a fall. Overall, the rates of injuries are very  low compared to other sports such as individual running (11 injuries per 1000 hours)  or team squash (14 injuries per 1000 hours) (6;7). Rates of injury for Nordic walking are lower than those for individual walking (2 injuries per 1000 hours) or cycling (4 injuries per 1000 hours) (6;7). Nordic walking can be enjoyed by almost all people (young and old, healthy and with chronic diseases). Nordic walking shows some very promising results in people with chronic health conditions. Some studies have shown advantages of Nordic walking compared to regular walking or specialized exercise programs in people with the following conditions (1;6;8): Nordic walking, like regular walking, is a safe and effective form of exercise in people with chronic conditions. Nordic walking can be undertaken in a variety of settings, including urban and outdoor locations. The findings from a small study in experienced female Nordic walkers showed that there were small to no differences in energy consumption across different surfaces. So it may not really matter if you walk on concrete, grass or artificial track, as you will generally consume the same amount of energy (9). There are a lot of different types of poles as well as advice about how to determine the correct or optimal length when using them. Most Nordic walkers select the length of their poles based on preference rather than science. There is limited research in this area, but one small laboratory study suggests that shorter or self-selected pole length makes very little difference (3% in uphill walking) in your energy expenditure (10). The middle-aged Nordic walkers in this study rated different pole lengths (self-selected height and 15 cm shorter) as equally comfortable (10). Another small study examined the impact of adding weight to the poles in young female Nordic walkers. This study showed that there was no important difference in the amount of energy used when using heavier weighted poles (up to 1.5 kilograms) relative to normal weight poles (11). We should note that both these studies were done in laboratory settings in small numbers of people. Currently, we don't know for sure that the height or weight of the polls cause you to have a better workout when Nordic walking. More research is needed. Some equipment companies would claim that there are important differences in the poles one could purchase to use while Nordic walking. Although, we don't have much research yet to help us compare any advantages between poles, there are a few things to consider. The first is that Nordic walking poles are not the same as the poles used for hiking (sometimes called trekking poles). Hiking poles tend to be much taller than Nordic walking poles; they are usually placed out front of the body to maximize stability and balance. In contrast, Nordic poles have straps around your wrist that allow you to grip and release the pole so that it is easier to push down on the pole. Nordic poles are used in such a way that the tip (usually made of rubber) points behind you as push down on the poles when you walk. There are several useful websites that can provide more details about the correct motions to use when Nordic walking from the International Nordic Walking Association (12) and the Canadian Nordic Walking Association (13). Nordic walking involves not only the muscles from your lower body but also those from your arms and upper back in order to move the poles.  It is a safe and effective exercise for healthy older adults and in people with chronic health conditions. The research is still ongoing but suggests some advantages relative to regular walking. These additional benefits stem from the use of the poles, which engage your arms and upper back. This results in a better body workout.""]"

Does a specialized pillow really help?,"[""We often use the phrase, 'a pain in the neck' to refer to difficult people or situations, not realizing that this phrase aptly describes the challenges one experiences with neck pain. Suffering with an acute episode of neck pain can really put a 'kink' in almost all activities in your daily life, including sleep. Losing sleep due to neck pain typically makes the pain feel worse.  Many people suffering with neck pain would welcome any suggestions to help them sleep better or prevent pain in the morning. Your doctor or fellow neck pain sufferers may have suggested the use of a 'specialized' pillow. In the quest for a pillow that will help, you notice a large variety of specialized pillows in local stores.  Many are available and perhaps you had not expected to be faced with so many choices. Which one should you select? The manufacturers make several health claims about the features that make their pillows 'special'. Sometimes these pillows are labelled as 'orthopaedic' or 'specialized' pillows.  The manufacturer claims suggest that specialized pillows are designed or ideal for those with neck pain. The claims suggest that the benefits of these pillows may be related to the type of material of the pillow (i.e. made from gel or foam or filled with water). Alternatively, the benefits are attributed to the shape of the specialized pillow (i.e. contoured, roll like, moldable, etc.). All of these special features are believed to provide better support to the neck or keep it in a good position while sleeping. Some of these specialized pillows are relatively expensive compared to regular pillows. But do these specialized pillows really help?  Which, if any of these special features, are worth the extra cost? Choosing a specialized pillow for neck pain is a valid health concern given the potential to help, and the cost. Neck pain is very common in the general population (1;2). More surprising is that it is a leading cause of disability. From 291 health conditions assessed, neck pain ranked fourth highest with respect to overall disability (3). Women were shown to have higher rates of disability and burden associated with neck pain relative to men (3). From 50% to 75% of the general population continue to experience problems one to five years after reporting neck pain (4). Neck pain can be experienced as very painful bouts that become worse over time. During these painful episodes some are unable to work or do the things they really enjoy. Unfortunately, the number of people complaining of neck pain increases as we age. This is made worse with body postures (i.e. ergonomics) that stress the neck when working with electronics (e.g. laptop computers, tablets).  Having pain in your neck can affect your ability to sleep and your overall quality of life. There are many different options to treat your neck pain, and one of these is the use of specialized pillows. A Cochrane systematic review (5) evaluated the best available research on the use of pillows and neck pain. The five trials evaluated in the systematic review compared the specialized pillow to: Unfortunately, only one of these five studies was conducted using good scientific methods. The review noted that there was little information about who funded the studies and what role the pillow manufacturer played in the research. This leaves us with uncertainty about the effects of using specialized pillows and who funded the research. The specialized pillows evaluated in these five clinical trials had very different shapes and materials. These differences make it difficult to judge the benefits of the specialized pillows, somewhat like comparing apples and oranges.  The specialized pillows were compared to participants 'usual pillow'. The usual pillows were not well described and this again makes it difficult to compare, somewhat like apples and 'mystery' fruit. To make matters worse, only two studies actually measured how sleep quality was affected. More research is needed before we can determine the benefits or harms from using these specialized pillows in people with neck pain. In general, there are few studies evaluating pillows and sleep. One study evaluated specialized pillows in people without neck pain. This study (4) compared five different pillows in people without neck pain who prefer side-sleeping. This study showed that the type of pillow material and the shape of the pillow may affect some aspects of sleep quality.  Unfortunately we have the same problem of comparisons we noted in studies in people with neck pain. The evidence in people without neck pain is equally limited. We don't yet have credible scientific evidence helping us understand the effect of specialized pillows. We don't know if they will help, hurt, or make any difference to pain, function or sleep in both people with and without neck pain. We also don't yet know about any potential negative effects when using specialized pillows. Few studies measured adverse effects, but when they did, they reported mild effects (e.g., sleep worsened while adjusting to the new pillow or increased pain in the morning). More research is needed to assess any potential benefits and harms associated with using specialized pillows. If your doctor or therapist suggests you use a specialized pillow, ask if there is the opportunity to try out some different types for several weeks. Note that you must encase the pillow in a plastic pillowcase, similar to those used in hospitals. As you try the different specialized pillows, monitor whether your morning pain decreases, or if your neck function improves or if the quality of your sleep improves. If these benefits occur, only then consider switching from your usual pillow.   Until we have more research, we need to use some caution and common sense when considering the purchase of specialized pillows.""]"
357,https://www.mcmasteroptimalaging.org/blog/detail/blog/2014/09/20/frailty-in-the-eye-of-the-beholder,20 September 2014,Frailty in the eye of the beholder,"[""Consider the typical scenario of Mrs. Black: Mrs. Black is a seventy-one year-old widow with four adult children. She has osteoarthritis and diabetes, for which she takes medications. She lives alone and tends to be isolated. She takes care of her personal needs such as cooking, cleaning, groceries and banking. She eats very little. Although she does not use a walking aid, she seems to have slowed down lately. Her children describe her as 'frail'. Most people seem to have some intuitive sense of what frailty is. So should Mrs. Black be considered frail? If so, can anything be done about it? These questions are in fact highly debated among experts who study aging (1). There does not exist, as yet, a tool widely used by doctors to diagnose frailty. Geriatricians will nevertheless declare that they can identify frailty in patients when they see it. It seems, however, that doctors and researchers are unable to agree on a single definition for frailty, suggesting that frailty may in fact be in the eyes of the beholder. This blog post examines the current understanding and issues associated with frailty. Frailty represents a form of vulnerability or weakness in the older person. It is different from simply 'growing old', since some individuals live to an old age without becoming frail. Furthermore, individuals of the same age can be quite different in terms of how frail they are. Frailty would be the opposite of what many consider successful aging. While there is still no agreement among experts on a common definition or clinical tool for identifying frailty, the most widely applied definition in research includes five symptoms (2): An individual with any three or more of these five symptoms is classified as frail (2). Many other definitions have been proposed and studied (3;4). Most include these five core symptoms in some form, but incorporate other components as well. Most notably, many recommend the inclusion of decreased mental function and depression as symptoms of frailty. Even if there is not yet a common understanding of the specifics of frailty, many experts advocate screening older persons for frailty (5). Frailty is believed to be an early sign of declining health. As such, it may serve as a 'red flag' prior to the occurrence of more severe or irreversible conditions, such as disability. In the example of Mrs. Black, the family and doctors would want to identify and address any factors that are contributing to her frailty symptoms. The goal is to prevent or at least slow down her decline. Compared to their non-frail counterparts, frail individuals are more likely to experience medical complications, disability, or imminent death. They are less likely to withstand the impact of harsh medical interventions such as surgery or chemotherapy. By identifying patients who are frail, doctors may be able to moderate such interventions and provide them with better tailored care. Most importantly, researchers are providing evidence that certain interventions may prevent or delay frailty, and perhaps even treat it once it has occurred. These interventions include (5): Older persons themselves may have their own perspectives of what it means to be frail. For example, factors such as mood, have been cited as important to patients and their families; often these are overlooked by clinicians and researchers (1;5;6). Psychological health plays an important role in older persons' beliefs about aging successfully.  In a study of older persons where only 15% experienced absence of physical illness, 92% reported feeling like they were aging successfully (7). The research evidence has demonstrated that stereotypes of aging, both positive and negative, are internalized by older persons. This  can have both short- and long-term effects on their health (8). For example, when older adults are exposed to negative aging stereotypes, performance on memory tasks, handwriting and walking speed, as well as physiological measures such as blood pressure, pulse rate, and skin conductance become worse. In fact, in one study, the research showed that an increase in walking speed for those exposed to positive aging stereotypes was comparable to that seen with several weeks of rigorous exercise. Negative stereotypes act as cardiovascular stressors while positive stereotypes reduce evidence of cardiovascular stress. Positive perceptions about aging have impressive long-term effects as well. Individuals with positive self-perceptions of aging have been found to have better functional abilities over a period of eighteen years. These findings should serve as a caution about a potential self-fulfilling prophecy when labelling older persons as 'frail'. We don't really know whether the benefits of targeted treatments and care for individuals identified as frail outweigh the harm that may result from the labeling.""]"

Part 4: What are the benefits and harms of interventions to those experiencing elder abuse?,"[""In this final Part 4 of this 4-part series, we examine the benefits and harms of interventions to help those experiencing elder abuse.  InParts 1and2, we defined elder abuse and detailed the risk factors and specific types of abuse. InPart 3we examined the views of Canadians on elder abuse compared to the evidence on the size of this problem. Many different types of interventions have been used to address elder abuse. Interventions are often targeted at four key groups: (a) those experiencing abuse, (b) those who are perpetrating the abuse, (c) health and social care professionals providing care to older persons, and (d) communities or society in general. Examples of elder abuse interventions are listed in Table 1. Education Counselling Case management Interprofessional and collaborative teams Referral to health services Legal counsel Financial support Housing assistance Advocacy Police support We don't have good information about which elder abuse interventions are effective. Here are some highlights from a recent review of elder abuse interventions (2): Four studies that have evaluated some interventions that included a psycho-educational support group, legal services, volunteer visitors, mandated reporting or advocacy services showed little improvement. There was no benefit when examining resolution of several outcomes including: 1) continuing abuse, 2) social-psychological client outcomes or 3) relocation. In two studies, there were harmful effects of home visiting plus education or volunteer visiting interventions as shown in a higher rate of recurrence of abuse.  This finding must be considered in light of the poor study methods. There has been little rigorous research on interventions for those perpetrating elder abuse. One study looked at the impact of an intervention targeted at caregivers who were at risk of abusing older family members (3). Caregivers received 8 training sessions related to aging, problem solving, stress and anger management and community resources. In this study, there was no evidence of the program's impact on the outcomes of anger, self-esteem, caregiver burden or general mental health. A recent systematic review of the literature on educational programs aimed at improving recognition and reporting of elder abuse and neglect among health professionals found that most evaluations focused only on participant satisfaction. Participants identified the value of interactive teaching techniques (e.g., hands-on learning with real or standardized patients), opportunities for discussion and feedback, and involvement of abuse survivors as facilitators or in videos of personal accounts as helpful in their learning. While some of the programs demonstrated improved knowledge of elder abuse, we do not know if there is any impact on recognition or reporting of elder abuse (1). There are a number of practice guidelines available to help healthcare professionals prevent and address elder abuse (4;5) but the impact of their implementation has not been evaluated. There have been a number of media campaigns (e.g., television advertisements) related to elder abuse, but there is no evidence of the impact of these efforts.  Broader initiatives such as Age Friendly initiatives and approaches to address ageism have not been evaluated for their impact on elder abuse. Many different types of interventions have been used to address elder abuse. Despite elder abuse being a common and serious problem, the best way to manage those experiencing and those perpetrating abuse, is not yet clear. More research is needed. In this four-part series of blog posts we discuss several aspects of elder abuse:""]"

Several drugs are available to treat the symptoms of AD.  However, not all provincial drug plans provide full coverage for these medications. This blog examines the drugs that are available to treat AD in Canada. Health Canada has approved four drugs to treat the cognitive symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease (AD): donepezil (Aricept® and generics), rivastigmine (Exelon® and generics), galantamine (Reminyl® and generics), and memantine (Ebixa® and generics).  These drugs are known as “cognitive enhancers”.  The first three are approved for use in persons with mild or moderate AD, while memantine is approved for use in persons with moderate or severe AD. These drugs do not cure AD, nor do they stop the disease from getting worse.  Rather, AD drugs treat the cognitive (or thinking) symptoms of the disease (1).  These drugs might help people remember small things or they might help people perform a little better in their daily activities, but the disease continues to progress.  Medical studies show the benefits of AD drugs can wear off after a few months; hardly any studies have examined these drugs for longer than one year (1). Persons with AD respond to the drugs differently.  A drug that treats symptoms for one person might not work for another person.  Doctors might have to prescribe two or more of the AD drugs before finding one that works for a particular patient. Currently, AD drugs cost about $5.00 Cdn per day (2).  Since these drugs do not cure the disease and their benefits wear off over time, public and private health insurers limit coverage to persons who meet certain conditions.  For example, to be prescribed donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine, persons must have mild or moderate AD.  Also, coverage might stop after a fixed period, even if a person’s symptoms have not changed since their last check up. Without insurance coverage, persons with AD and their families must pay for their own drugs. This can be financially straining because most people with AD are retired and on fixed incomes.  Spouses may also be on fixed incomes and children may have financial obligations of their own. Provincial governments are responsible for health care in Canada.  They spend an average of 38% of their budgets on health care (3).  Within this sector, the provinces pay workers’ salaries, fund hospitals, cover medical procedures, and reimburse the cost of drugs for hundreds of serious diseases.  If the healthcare budget increases, governments will have to reduce the provision of goods and services in other areas such as education or public transit.  Or, governments will have to borrow more money or raise taxes. The provinces have to consider whether they should spend money on AD drugs instead of treatments for other diseases.  Ultimately, AD drugs treat symptoms only, do not cure the disease, do not work for every patient, and wear off over time.  Other treatments, including drugs or surgeries, might be more effective for treating equally devastating diseases.  Faced with limits on how much money is available to spend, the provinces must make difficult choices and they have chosen to restrict coverage for AD drugs.  The impact of these medications on health care in general is smaller than the impact of treatments for some other diseases. While governments have to balance many competing demands with limited budgets, other groups have different priorities. Pharmaceutical companies, advocacy groups, patients, and patients’ families may argue for expanded AD drug coverage. Pharmaceutical companies have sponsored most of the large AD drug trials.  They often put the most favourable ‘spin’ on the results of these trials, even when the benefits of the drugs are small or non-existent (4).  Pharmaceutical companies urge the provinces to pay for AD drugs.  Public insurance coverage generates more prescriptions, which leads to increased sales and market share for these companies.\nAdvocacy groups, such as the Alzheimer’s Society of Canada and the Alzheimer’s Association in the United States, exist to help persons with AD.  These people want improved access to AD drugs, so advocacy groups argue for better drug coverage. The impact of AD is perhaps most profoundly felt by the spouses, children, other relatives, and friends of persons with AD.  These people witness how AD slowly strips away the very essence of their loved ones’ being.  Often motivated by love and sympathy, relatives and friends will seek out any treatment, no matter how good or bad, in the hope that they can somehow help their loved one ‘get well’.  Any drug is seen as a better option than nothing, even if the chance for lasting change is small.  One need only search the Internet to see the vast number of complementary treatments that claim (despite a lack of solid medical evidence) to help or even cure AD. Although millions of dollars are spent on AD research every year, scientists still do not understand all of the causes of AD.  This absence of knowledge has hampered the development of more effective drugs.  Optimistic predictions suggest that we may have to wait as much as ten years before new classes of drugs that target the disease process, rather than symptoms alone, become available (5).']"

According to the Canadian Institute for Health Information (CIHI), 33% of community-living seniors have three or more chronic conditions (1). Scientific evidence suggests that multiple chronic health conditions are associated with: In fact, the driving force in healthcare use appears to be patients' multiple chronic health conditions rather than aging itself. In Ontario, for example, it is the most complex 10% of seniors (the frail and those with multiple chronic health conditions) that account for 60% of the provincial healthcare spending (3). Managing multiple chronic health conditions is challenging for both patients and their health care providers. Traditionally, doctors and other health care providers have used Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) to assist them in making medical test and treatment decisions for their patients. CPGs are sets of recommendations for specific health conditions. They are created after an exhaustive review of the best available research evidence and practice experience. When applied appropriately, CPGs can maximize benefits for patients with a specific health condition. However, they can sometimes create new problems when applied to seniors with multiple chronic health conditions. Several research studies have shown that most CPGs do not consider how their recommendations might affect older patients with multiple health conditions (2). For example, a recent Canadian review of CPGs for the ten most common chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes, heart problems, etc.) found that only three provided specific recommendations for older patients with multiple health conditions (4). As a result, clinicians are becoming increasingly concerned about using different CPGs for the multiple health conditions of their patients. This is because: Making decisions and prescribing medications for older adults with multiple conditions is complex. Ideally, medical treatments would improve all health outcomes whether they improve your symptoms, daily function, or how long you live. However, these treatment outcomes are often at odds with one another.  There can be a dilemma where the improvement of one outcome (e.g. symptoms of breathlessness) may worsen the other (e.g. survival). Many experts in elder care recommend an individualized, holistic approach rather than a strict following of CPG recommendations. This approach aims to optimize decision-making and patient treatments by re-evaluating whether: Using this information, patients and healthcare providers must decide whether a medication is more likely to help (provide the proposed or expected benefit) or harm (produce any known adverse effect) in their lifetime. This is known as the 'time to benefit' or 'payoff time' model. This model is a reminder that many patients with multiple health conditions may not live long enough to reap the rewards from medical treatments. This occurs because many medications have the potential to cause immediate discomfort or harm, but the health benefits may take years to appreciate (8;9). Patients and healthcare providers also need to have a common and respectful understanding of each other's values and goals of care. Patients place varying degrees of importance on health outcomes (10). These may include quantity vs. quality of life, future vs. present health, and symptom relief vs. disease prevention. Depending on one's values, the appropriateness or priority of specific treatments and medications can vary significantly. For this reason, healthcare providers should know about your priorities and beliefs regarding medication-related risk and benefit. Once this has been established, a good plan for healthy living, optimal aging and end-of-life concerns can be developed. This will allow them to prescribe more effectively as your situation and needs change over time. A number of clinical tools have been developed to help your healthcare provider develop your health plan. These include tools that will: You may want to ask your doctor about some of these clinical tools as you work on your health plan. Many Canadians live with multiple chronic health conditions and most CPG have not been developed for older adults in this situation. Making decisions about your care and your medications are complex. An individualized approach, that takes into account your values and goals may be the best option for older adults with multiple chronic health conditions.""]"

Adults of all ages are getting together in large and small groups to chat, laugh, share and support, but primarily to walk. Walking has long been considered an ideal form of physical exercise. It is easy, accessible, requires no special skills or equipment, poses little risk of injury, and can be done virtually anywhere. Moreover it has been shown to be effective in contributing to overall weight loss, lowering BMI (body mass index) and body fat percentage, and decreasing blood pressure (1). It’s no surprise then that walking clubs and groups have such an immense following. Walking in groups – as opposed to walking alone – offers several advantages: motivation and support from other group members, opportunities to meet people and socialize, and greater security (another example of safety in numbers). Walking in groups is particularly popular among populations that are most physically inactive (2, 3).These may include retirees and other older adults whose current lifestyles no longer offer opportunities for regular daily exercise. The social benefits alone may be worth joining a walking group, not to mention the motivation to increase your physical activity (4). But do walking groups make any difference to your health? Arecent high qualitysystematic reviewsummarized the results of 42 studies, involving 1843 participants to measure whether taking part in walking groups improves physical health and mental health (5). The verdict: Walking groups are worth it!\xa0 People in the groups were more likely to show improvements in blood pressure, heart rate, body fat, fitness and walking speed among other benefits. Depression was also lower among walkers compared to people who didn’t participate. The majority of walkers were older adults (average age was 58) with existing health issues, such as arthritis, dementia, depression and Parkinson’s disease. The authors do recommend more research to measure the benefits of walking groups for healthy adults, but if you – like many older adults – are living with at least one chronic health condition, it is very helpful to know that walking groups can benefit you. Plus, it is a simple and enjoyable thing to do! These studies found that most people completed the entire program and there were no notable side effects. With the widespread popularity of walking clubs and groups it shouldn’t be difficult to find one in your community that suits your schedule and goals. Alternatively, you can start your own! Previous research shows that group walking programs are equally effective whether they are delivered by professionals or lay people (4), so starting a group could be \xa0as simple as asking a friend or neighbour to be your walking partner. Don’t be surprised if before long there are more like-minded people ready to lace up, step out and join you on the path toward better fitness and health.']"

But for some of these patients, the pain becomes severe and chronic, negatively affecting their mobility, mood and general quality of life.1 While chronic back pain sufferers are often prescribed medications, many people are wary of taking drugs for long periods of time, or are unable to take certain medications due to their side effects, and seek complementary – or alternate - therapies.3One such therapy is the ancient Indian practice of yoga, which involves physical exercise, relaxation and lifestyle modification.4 A recent, well-done systematic review of 10 randomized controlled trials involving 967 chronic back pain patients,5showed strong evidence that practising yoga does in fact relieve the pain and disability associated with low back pain, particularly in the short term (approximately three months). In the longer term – about a year – more moderate improvements were realized. Yoga is not associated with any serious adverse effects, and in fact, the stretching and physical postures (asana), breathing techniques (pranayama) and meditation (dyana)6are widely believed to promote vitality, health and well-being for people of all ages. For those experiencing chronic low back pain, yoga can be confidently recommended either as an alternative therapy or in addition to medication. So if you are dogged by chronic back pain, a few ‘downward dogs’ just might provide some welcome relief!']"

Fast facts about walking speed","[""In this two-part series of blog posts on walking speed we look at what you need to know and how to improve your walking speed. In Part 1, we'll look at some of the basics and a simple test you can do to determine your walking speed. InPart 2, we discuss how to improve your walking speed. Walking speed (gait speed) or mobility is necessary for most tasks that humans undertake. Slowing of walking speed is associated with aging in all persons. Walking speed has also been associated both with how long a person will live (survival) (1;2) and with changes that occur when older persons are having difficulty or become unable to do tasks (3;4). In research studies walking ability has been assessed by tests where persons are either asked to walk at their usual speed (sometimes called self-selected walking speed) OR fast walking speed where a person is instructed to walk as fast as they can safely (5-12). To undertake various activities within the community that involve walking, the average distances required to walk vary from 200-600 metres (13;14). The task that usually concerns older persons most in relation to walking speed is how quickly they need to walk in order to cross a road safely. The critical speed cited for this task is 1.14 meters/second and has been broken down in the following way: The speed we are able to walk decreases as we age. There are several reports that indicate some normal ranges for older persons. For example, general walking speeds for community activities are 1.2-1.4 metres/sec until 80 years and 1.0-1.8 metres/second until 90 years and older (4;15-18). Older persons who have a walking speed of less than 1metre/second have reported ceasing involvement in any regular physical activity (19). Self- selected walking speed associated with frailty has been reported as less than 0.65 metres/second if you are short (i.e. = 159cm) and 0.75m/sec if you are taller (height >159cm) (20). Below is a Table (16) of usual walking speeds given for women and men by different age groups. You can assess your walking speed using the10 metre walk test(5;8;10). You need a 20 metre path with 5 metres to get up to normal speed, 10 metres for measurement of your normal walking pace and 5 metres to slow down.  You should measure how long it takes you to walk the 10 metre length or get someone else to time your walking speed over this distance.  The figure below illustrates how to do this. Then calculate your walking speed by dividing 10 metres by the number of seconds it took you to determine your speed in metres/second. InPart 2of this two-part blog series on walking speed, we discuss how to improve your walking speed.""]"

When women leak urine during exercise, sneezing, or coughing, doctors call this type of incontinencestress-related (2). When women have strong urges to urinate and have trouble holding urine until getting to the bathroom, they may have what is known asurgencyincontinence (2). Although most women have one or the other type of incontinence, older women often have both types. Incontinence hurts women\'s self-confidence, interferes with their ability to enjoy their favorite activities, and decreases the quality of their lives (1). Women have several options to manage their urinary incontinence and these primarily include either drug or non-drug treatments. Many studies have shown that the majority of women improve their symptoms using non-drug conservative interventions and these include: Intra-vaginal electrical or magnetic stimulation may help some women with incontinence (3). However, some women do not benefit from these non-drug treatments, or they are unable to access these treatments, or make the necessary lifestyle changes. In this case, doctors may suggest the use of drugs to help with incontinence problems.  We review the current scientific evidence about the effectiveness of these drugs to help manage incontinence. Health Canada and the Food and Drug Administration in the United States have approved several medications from two drug classes for adult women with frequent urges to urinate (overactive bladder with or withouturgencyincontinence). Six approvedantimuscarinicdrugs work because they block nerve signals regulating bladder muscle contractions; the drugs help to relax the bladder muscle and to decrease urges to void. Several studies have shown that these drugs resolve urinary incontinence in one woman among every eight or nine treated (3). These drugs include: However, these drugs, especially oxybutynin, may cause adverse effects which may include: For oxybutynin, one out of every 16 women stopped using it because of intolerable side effects. When researchers compared the benefits and harms across these six different antimuscarinic drugs, they found that although these drugs demonstrate similar benefits, the potential for adverse effects was not the same (3). Women should discuss with their doctor what adverse effects are the most troubling for them. They can then choose the medication with the least risk for those specific side effects. Unfortunately, none of the clinical studies evaluated the long-term safety of these antimuscarinic drugs. All drugs were tested in older women (+65) (3;18). However, we do not know long-term safety of these drugs in real-life geriatric settings. Future research should look at long-term safety in older women who are also taking several medications because of other chronic diseases. Limited evidence shows that pelvic floor exercises or bladder training have similar effectiveness but less harms when compared with drug treatments for women with urgency incontinence (3). Two medications, in the beta-three adrenergic agonist class of drugs, have been studied in women withurgencyincontinence. These medications work by improving the bladder\'s capacity to hold urine and therefore increase the time between ""urgent"" trips to the toilet. Mirabegron (Myrbetriq®) (13-16;19;20) and solabegron (21) are newer drugs and have been designed to resolveurgencyurinary incontinence without causing bothersome harms. However, fewer clinical studies have examined these drugs. Future research will help us to know more about the long-term safety of mirabegron and solabegron. Health Canada and the FDA have not yet approved drugs specifically forstress-related incontinence (2). To date, the research on drugs or hormones used in women with stress-related incontinence is limited (few studies with small numbers of patients) and shows that they are not beneficial. In Europe and the United States, some specialists were using duloxetine (an antidepressant) to treat women with stress-related incontinence. This practice should stop because of the potential for side effects and the studies have shown very little benefit. In several clinical trials duloxetine improved symptoms of incontinence in only 1 out of 13 women. In addition,  these studies showed that 1 out of 8 women stopped taking this drug because of intolerable side effects (3). Currently, clinical guidelines do not recommend the use of duloxetine for women withstressincontinence (22;23). There are some studies that have used hormones, specifically estrogens in a cream or tablet form to treatstress-related incontinence. At this time there is not enough scientific evidence to conclude with confidence that topical estrogen is effective and safe for most women(3). Currently, clinical guidelines do not recommend the use of topical estrogen for treatingstress-related incontinence. We need to remember that drugs are not free of consequences and that they always increase our risk for unwanted side effects. First, women who want help with their incontinence problems should seek to make lifestyle changes such as exercising more and losing excessive weight. The earlier in our lives we adopt such healthy behaviors, the better we will be when we get older (1). Keeping with these healthy behaviors is a key for success when dealing with incontinence. However, for some women, lifestyle changes may not be enough and they may wish to discuss the use of drugs to manage their incontinence. If you are considering asking your doctor about the use of drugs, go prepared. Women should inform themselves about the specific benefits, harms, and costs of the medications. Together women and their doctors can make the best choice and select the optimal balance between the benefits and potential harms of medications for treating incontinence. If you have trouble with leaking urine, know that you are not alone; many women suffer from urinary incontinence. There is no shame in discussing this problem with your doctor or an incontinence professional (nurse, physiotherapist). The real harm is in ignoring incontinence. Non-drug treatments, such as healthy lifestyle changes or pelvic floor exercises, should be the first choice. Once you start adopting healthy behaviors, sticking to these good habits will serve you well in the long run. Currently there are no effective medications for women withstressincontinence. In contrast, women withurgencyincontinence have good evidence that several medications can be helpful. There are eight drug choices available and women can make informed decisions with their doctors. We ""urge"" you to take into account the balance between benefits and harm for each of eight available drugs and to make informed treatment decisions after discussions with incontinence professionals.']"

Part 3: What do Canadians believe about abuse compared to the evidence of the size of the problem?,"[""In Part 3 of this 4 part series, we look at the views of Canadians on elder abuse compared to the evidence on the size of this problem. The public's perception of abuse is important to understand if we are to develop effective strategies to prevent abuse. InParts 1and2, we defined elder abuse and detailed the risk factors and specific types of abuse.  InPart 4, we examine the benefits and harms of interventions to help those experiencing elder abuse. We don't yet have good information documenting the size of the problem of elder abuse in Canada. We discussed some of the reasons for this inPart 1 of this seriesof blogs. These include fear and shame associated with reporting elder abuse and the way in which we define abuse is not consistent. We do, however, have some reasonable information on Canadians' opinions about elder abuse. The Canadian government has sponsored two surveys asking citizens about elder abuse. Evaluating public opinion on elder abuse was important to set up awareness campaigns as a strategy for prevention. Here are some highlights from a recent survey 2008-09 survey: This survey data suggests that Canadians were certainly aware that elder abuse exists and believed it occurred frequently, but they did not see it as a major concern to older adults. Based on this same survey data, 43% of Canadians believe that neglect is the most frequent type of abuse, followed by psychological abuse (25%). Only 8% of Canadians believe that physical abuse is the most common form that seniors experience (2). This is surprising since survey participants immediately mentioned physical abuse most often when asked about elder abuse generally. The other noteworthy point is that most survey participants did not see sexual abuse as an issue in the elderly. It is not clear why Canadians believe what they do about elder abuse, as there has been limited scientific evidence about the magnitude of the problem generally and specifically about the different types of abuse. Attempting to assess how common the problem of elder abuse is in Canada is somewhat complicated. The evidence is limited because it is based on self-report and does not include older people living in institutions. Two surveys have been conducted in Canada on the mistreatment of older people (65 years or older); they asked seniors if they were experiencing abuse. One telephone survey conducted in 1989 showed that A second telephone survey conducted in 1999 revealed that It is difficult to say if rates really changed over the 10-year period from the first and second survey. The comparison is further muddied as the elder abuse was measured differently in these two surveys. A new research project evaluating the rate of elder abuse in Canada in the general population is currently in progress, and will be completed in 2015 (2;6).\xa0 This new research will be of great assistance in estimating how big the problem of elder abuse is in Canada; we will also have better information about the frequency of different types of abuse. It is difficult to compare the rates in Canada with other countries that have attempted to measure elder abuse. One review compared international studies reporting the frequency of any type of abuse (physical, psychological or emotional, etc.) (4). Most of these studies were done in North America or Europe. The estimates varied widely across countries; in Spain, for example, reported rates of abuse ranged from 2.6% to 29.3%. Although there are several reasons why studies report different rates of elder abuse, one of the key reasons is related to our definition of this health issue. We noted that the cultural context is an important factor in defining abuse. So, it would not be surprising to see differences in rates of elder abuse across countries. What we can be sure of is that elder abuse seems to be found in almost all countries where it has been evaluated. Although, most Canadians (97%) believe that the abuse experienced by older adults goes undetected, the good news is that most (78%) are aware that there is help available for this problem (1). In fact, most Canadians (77%) believe that many types of elder abuse are crimes (1). In this four-part series of blog posts we discuss several aspects of elder abuse:""]"

However, everyone else (your kids and grandkids) are still sleeping. You wonder why it is that others need to sleep longer than you. The duration of our sleep may be of concern to some of us and begs the question: \xa0how much sleep is 'normal' and how much do I need for successful aging?” Although an apparently simple question, there is no simple answer! Clearly sleep is important to our health, but what amount of sleep is best? Researchers  have studied sleep in healthy individuals and know a fair bit about what the average amount of sleep (duration) is. We do know that our sleep duration changes with age.  In general, sleep duration decreases as we age, ranging from: There is a great degree of variability in these estimates, though, and many people 'normally' sleep as little as 5 and as long as 9 hours per night (1). At the moment the research suggests that we sleep less as we age. In addition to the amount of time that we sleep, there may be some changes with the quality of our sleep as we age; sleep generally becomes less efficient (2). There is scientific evidence that sleep duration does have links to overall health.  In the general population, people who sleep 7-8 hours a night have lower risk of death than those who sleep either shorter or longer (3).  However, it is not at all clear why this is.  Generally speaking, sleep duration changes can either cause health problems, or be the result of health problems.  It is difficult to tell these two possibilities apart. Given that all humans and animals sleep, it is logical that sleep should be important to health.  You may ask, so what is the scientific evidence that poor sleep causes poor health?  In order to know if one thing causes the other, we need to perform experiments. For example, if we created an experiment where we could follow people over several years; one group of people would be allowed to sleep normally, but the other group would sleep for only 5 hours per night. In this type of study, we could see if sleep deprivation causes diseases.   Obviously, conducting this type of study is unethical.   However, studies in people who have been sleep-deprived for short periods have shown reduced cognitive performance (thinking, reasoning, etc.) and irritability.  Depriving people of sleep can also cause craving for food, which could potentially cause  weight gain over the longer term(4)).  Shift workers (who have irregular sleep imposed upon them by their jobs) have an increased risk of heart attack and stroke(5). In animals, we can more easily perform experiments and there is some animal evidence that sleep could prevent diseases.  Experiments have been done in mice who have been genetically engineered to be at risk of Alzheimer's disease. When they are deprived of sleep, these special mice show increased accumulation of abnormal Alzheimer-related proteins (6).  A recent animal study also showed that clearance of pathologic (i.e. 'bad') proteins doubles during sleep (7). Although these studies are conducted in animals it may suggest important relationships between sleep and Alzheimer’s disease. Future studies in humans will be important. On the other hand, just because sleep and mortality seem to be linked in studies in people, it does not mean that sleep problems cause diseases that lead to our deaths.  First of all, there can be another explanation; for example, sleep could be disrupted by a poor home environment, which could itself be linked to other factors that increase risk of illness.  Also, one could think of several reasons why the relationship might be 'backwards'.  For example, difficulty with falling and staying asleep in a proper daily rhythm is a common symptom of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease; these problems often occur before disease is otherwise evident. (Note, however, that most people with these sleep problems will never develop one of these diseases).  Also, being overweight is a risk factor for stroke and heart diseases; being overweight increases risk of sleep apnea, and sleep apnea is known to increase sleep duration.  Finally, medications, used for serious conditions, can either increase or decrease sleep duration.  If sleep duration changes are a sign of disease, rather than a cause, then fixing the sleep problem may not affect the ultimate outcome. When does a sleep problem require a special medical consultation?  Given what we have just said, it is hard to know if changes in sleep duration by themselves would require medical consultation.  In general, minor sleep disruption does not require further evaluation.  However, there are a few circumstances which probably require further investigation, including: So, although we know that sleep is important for health, there is no straightforward answer to the question of how much sleep you need to stay healthy.""]"

Part 2: What are the risk factors and types of elder abuse?,"['InPart 1of this 4 part series we defined elder abuse and how the definitions of abuse have changed over time.  In Part 2, we expand upon the different types of elder abuse. We also examine important risk factors that may help to identify people who are vulnerable to abuse, as well as, people who are more likely to commit the abuse. InPart 3, we look at the views of Canadians on elder abuse compared to the evidence on the size of this problem. InPart 4, we examine the benefits and harms of interventions to help those experiencing elder abuse. In general, risk factors are circumstances that may increase the chances of developing a disease or sustaining an injury. Researchers seek to evaluate risk factors that may be changed or modified, in the hope that the chances of illness or injury may be reduced. Sometimes risk factors cannot be altered but they may still serve as signs for potential problems that require our attention. In the case of elder abuse, there are risk factors associated with 1) the person who is the victim of the abuse, 2) those who are more likely to commit the abuse (the perpetrator), 3) the relationship between the abused person and the perpetrator, and 4) the living circumstances of the person being abused. A well-conducted systematic review(1) evaluated the scientific evidence identifying different risk factors for elder abuse. This systematic review examined 25 studies in the general population of community-dwelling seniors (those not  living in institutions), 13 studies in older people requiring assistance with their activities of daily living (ADL), and 11 studies in elders with dementia.  The review showed that only half the studies (27 from 49) adequately evaluated risk factors for elder abuse. Some important risk factors identified in this systematic review can be grouped into four categories: Detecting and preventing elder abuse needs to be considered in the context of the culture where it is occurring. Most of the research done on elder abuse is from developed countries. As such, identifying risk factors reflects the cultural context of the countries where the studies took place. There is a need for more research in this area generally and this should include the study of risk factors in different cultures. Recall that any action or lack of action that brings harm to an older person can be considered elder abuse. It can be a single event or done repeatedly. Since most of the current research (and reporting) on elder abuse has been conducted in developed nations, the actions labelled as abuse reflect the culture and context of these countries. We generally understand abuse to be classified into five types: The tables below provide a definition and description of the actions associated with the different types of elder abuse. Damaging or destroying property As we noted inPart 1, there are different definitions of abuse that often reflect the laws of a region or country, or definitions that change over time. The actions described in the tables may not reflect all aspects of elder abuse that occur in cultural contexts where elder abuse has not been studied. For example, in some traditional cultures older widows may be forced to marry against their consent. Although, this may appear to be a private matter, it may reflect psychological and financial abuse. Elder abuse can happen to people of all backgrounds, races, religions, and ages. It can happen in any family or relationship. Elder abuse may be difficult to talk about especially if it is being committed by a family member. However, there is nothing to be embarrassed about; it is important to get help. It is critical that we become aware of the signs of elder abuse. No one should have to experience any type of abuse. If you notice any of the signs associated with elder abuse (described in the tables above) take action and speak to someone. You may want to contact family or friends, members of your local faith community, health-care providers, social services, the police, or members of the legal profession. Help is available so donít delay in moving forward to stop abuse. In some provinces it is mandatory to report elder abuse. Here are a few steps to help you report elder abuse.

Part 1: What is elder abuse?,"[""The problem ofelder abuseshould be of concern to all of us. We often fail to recognize the signs of abuse. We may be living next door to someone experiencing some form of abuse and simply be unaware that it is happening. As the proportion of the population over age 65 years increases, it is likely that the problem of elder abuse will also increase.It is important to know that older people may experience different kinds of abuse. This knowledge will allow us to recognize significant clues that someone is being abused. More importantly, we need to recognize some simple things that we can all do to help identify and prevent elder abuse in our communities. In this four-part series we discuss all aspects of elder abuse: Many of us are aware that elder abuse exists, but question the extent of this problem in Canadian society.  Surprisingly, measuring elder abuse is no simple matter. In part, this is because it is not easy to ask people if they are being abused. Fear and shame are some of the emotions that victims of abuse experience, as well as reluctance to disclose that they are being abused. Victims of abuse may fear backlash or worsening abuse if they speak out. They may fear that they will have to leave their home to avoid the abuse. As a result, much of the abuse remains hidden, and abuse becomes a taboo subject. It is, however, a major health problem for the person experiencing the abuse and a societal problem that requires attention.Although most Canadians are aware of elder abuse, many would not be able to define it precisely. Generally,any action or lack of action that brings harm to an older personcan be considered  elder abuse. Often this abuse is caused by someone who is trusted by the older adult. The person causing the abuse (known as the perpetrator of abuse) is usually known by the older adult and may be a paid caregiver, friend, or even a family member. In institutionalized care there is the potential for abuse between residents; however, this type of abuse is different in that the perpetrator is not in a position to provide care or assistance to the person experiencing the abuse.  Abuse can occur in any number of settings including an individual's own home, acute care hospitals, day centres, and nursing homes. It is troubling to think that these are places where an older person should feel the safest. Elder abuse can occur regardless of gender, age, religion, race or culture; unfortunately abuse has been found in all of these contexts.Although the definition of abuse has evolved over the last 20 years, we now understand that there are five common types of abuse: physical, psychological or emotional, sexual, financial, and neglect (abandonment). Elder abuse and self-neglect are not the same. When an older person is being neglected, the neglect is due to someone else's actions or inactions. When older people neglect themselves, it is the result of their own actions and behaviours. Self-neglect occurs when people intentionally or unintentionally fail to take care of themselves (like not eating, not taking their medications or not taking care of their basic hygiene). While it seems obvious that if seniors are abused, they will experience negative health consequences, there is limited research evaluating this issue. One well-conducted American study showed that older persons being abused had approximately three times the risk for death compared with those who were not mistreated (1). This study followed people forward in time and the researchers took into account a number of other factors that could have added to their risk of dying (e.g., age, gender, having chronic diseases, functional status, social networks, cognitive status, and depression). This study made a very good attempt in estimating the long-term risks linking abuse and mortality. Unfortunately, we do not yet have many good studies exploring the risk between abuse and poor health outcomes. There are a number of reasons for this, and one of these reasons is that we have had differing definitions of abuse over time. The study of elder abuse is a relatively new area of research compared to abuse in children or in women (2).The research suggests that part of the problem with studying elder abuse is that it is not defined consistently (3). Sometimes our understanding of elder abuse varies because of differing laws between regions or countries. Our understanding of elder abuse may also differ because of lack of agreement on what activities or actions are considered abuse. Our definition of elder abuse has changed over time and some studies reflect the historical and social context of the era in which it was evaluated. A recent systematic review (4) identified 42 different studies and showed how elder abuse labels changed over time. From the mid 1970s to the mid-1980s elder abuse was characterized exclusively as physical assault on female seniors (called granny-battering). From the mid 1980s to 2003, our understanding of abuse widened to include psychological or emotional and financial abuse.\nCurrently, there is agreement that there are five main types of abuse. However, there is some disagreement as to what actions (and circumstances) within these five categories should be labeled as elder abuse. The specifics of these five categories of abuse are detailed in Part 2 of this series. As we noted previously, we may be living next door to someone experiencing some form of abuse and simply be unaware that it is happening. We know that being exposed to abuse puts you at greater risk for poor health outcomes such as mortality. The research on elder abuse is limited for a number of different reasons. In part this is related to the social stigma (fear and shame) of people reporting their own abuse. It is also related to differences over time in how we have defined elder abuse.\nWe need more concerted efforts to prevent elder abuse. The first step is recognizing and identifying the signs of abuse (see Part 2 for more details). If you or someone you know may be experiencing abuse, don't be embarrassed to get help. InPart 2 of this serieswe review the different types of risk factors and types of elder abuse.InPart 3 of this serieswe examine what Canadians believe about elder abuse and the evidence on the size of the problem in Canada and elsewhere.InPart 4we discuss the benefits and possible harms of elder abuse interventions.""]"

While two-thirds of dementia is caused by Alzheimer\'s disease, there are many other causes including dementia associated with other medical conditions like stroke and Parkinson\'s disease.  Dementia is characterized by cognitive impairment (problems with memory, language, concentration, etc.), difficulties with activities of daily living (cooking, cleaning, finances, dressing, grooming, etc.) and behaviour problems.  Up to 90% of people with Alzheimer\'s disease will develop behaviour problems over the course of their illness including depression, anxiety, agitation, aggression, psychosis (hallucinations and delusions) and apathy (loss of interest, lack of motivation).  It is these behaviours, also known as the ""neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia"", that cause suffering for the patient, increase burden and caregiver stress, and increase the cost of care.  Behaviours such as agitation and aggression lead to caregiver burnout and the premature need for institutionalization.  Treating these neuropsychiatric symptoms is important in order to relieve the patients\' suffering, reduce caregiver burden, and hopefully delay the need for long-term care. The Canadian Consensus Conference on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Dementia has met four times over the last two decades to provide Canadian physicians with guidelines for managing dementia based on the best available medical evidence.  The guidelines stress that treatment of behavior problems begins with careful assessment and diagnosis (1). There should be some consideration of other causes of changes in behaviour, which could include: If changes to these factors do not improve behaviour, then environmental and behavioural interventions should be instituted.  There is increasingly good evidence that these non-medication treatments are effective and safe(2) , though different behaviours require different interventions.  For example, music can be particularly beneficial for symptoms of anxiety and depression and may be helpful for agitation and aggression (3).  Teaching caregivers behavioural interventions can improve a variety of problems including agitation, aggression and apathy (4). These behavioural interventions can include: Providing supportive counselling for caregivers can improve both patient and caregiver depressive symptoms (5). If non-medication interventions are not effective enough, then physicians could consider drugs for some of these behavior problems. Drug treatment could include the typical Alzheimer\'s disease drugs like donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine and memantine. These drugs appear to have modest benefits for treating apathy, depression, agitation and psychosis (6).  Specific psychiatric medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics and antianxiety drugs, have been used to treat behavior problems as well (7). The psychiatric medications mentioned previously are being used far too frequently in patients with dementia. This is often before appropriate assessment, diagnosis and non-medication treatments have been given to them.  In Ontario, anywhere from one-third to two-thirds of nursing home residents with dementia are being treated with antipsychotics.  These drugs have modest effects on agitation, aggression and psychosis. They also have well-known serious side effects including excessive sedation, Parkinson\'s disease-type symptoms, increased risk of stroke and even a small increased risk of death.  Canadian treatment guidelines (8) clearly state that these drugs should only be used for severe agitation, aggression and psychosis; use should also be considered only when there is risk of harm to the patient or others in their environment.  Furthermore, the benefits must be weighed against the significant risks mentioned above. The caregiver who provides substitute consent must be informed of these potential adverse effects.']"

Medication review encourages best use and reduces adverse effects.","['We have arrived at the fourth and final part of this series on polypharmacy. InPart 3we discussed the availability of online databases to help you detect potential medication interactions and side effects. In Part 4 we discuss the importance of a medication review. A medication review with a doctor, pharmacist or nurse can help ensure people are on the best set of medications for their health problems. The aim of a medication review is to help someone be on the best medications to treat their specific illness. Another important aim is to prevent or reduce the risk of future health problems. A medication review focuses on ensuring that the patient is receiving: Medication reviews are often done by physicians, pharmacists or other healthcare providers who help people manage their medications. Physicians and pharmacists will often work with each other and together with people taking medications (2). A recent Cochrane systematic review (2) on this topic was done by researchers from the United Kingdom and New Zealand. This study suggests that medication reviews may reduce inappropriate prescribing and medication-related problems; at the same time it encourages the appropriate use of medications, provides people with important education, and encourages them to take better care of their health. The benefit of pharmaceutical care was seen even more when everybody on the health team (doctors, specialists, pharmacists, and nurses) worked together. Another helpful approach identified by this study, that looked at different ways to improve how medications are prescribed, was the use of interactive computer software designed to help health care professionals with clinical decisions (2). These systems have become more accessible to physicians, not just pharmacists. Another Cochrane systematic review (3) carried out by Danish researchers showed that medication reviews reduce emergency department visits. There is weaker evidence about whether medication reviews impact adverse drug effects and hospital events such as mortality or hospital admissions (2). The Canadian Medical Association Journal provides a tip sheet that has questions that you can ask to: The tip sheet can be located at the following link: (http://www.cmaj.ca/content/175/8/876).Using the electronic drug interaction checker databases mentioned in Part 3 before visiting a healthcare professional is important. It could also help identify questions you may have for your health care provider before your next visit. News reports, magazines, and television are also reporting polypharmacy as a growing problem. The news media often highlight how people can weigh the risks versus the benefits of their medications for themselves (5;6). Currently, the Ontario Pharmacy Research Collaboration (7) is conducting research about medication approaches that aim to improve medication management. Things that help with this include guidelines for your doctor about taking people off medications such as MedsChecks, Pharmaceutical Opinions, and other interventions. \xa0Taking you off some medications is called \'deprescribing\'. When your doctor is deprescribing medications it means that he or she will monitor you during a ""process of tapering, withdrawing, discontinuing, or stopping"" medications (8). Deprescribing will reduce the effects of polypharmacy and associated negative side effects. In the end it will reduce your risk because it reduces inappropriate or ineffective medication use (8). More information about deprescribing can be found athttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deprescribing. Medications can be very helpful but they can also be harmful. As one ages the benefit and risk profile of a medication may change. Medications may interact with one another when used together to cause increased or decreased effects. Pay attention to how you feel and periodically ask a pharmacist, physician or other prescriber to do a medication review. In this medication review you can revisit the need for each medication. Doing a review will ensure the least harm and most benefit overall. This four-part series of blog posts explores various aspects of polypharmacy.Part 1defined the issue.

Online drug interaction checkers to assess side effects.","['InPart 1we identified that polypharmacy really means you are taking at least 3 to 5 different medications (including vitamins, food supplements and herbs). InPart 2we discussed how our bodies affect the medications (pharmacokinetics) and medications affect our bodies (pharmacodynamics). Taking multiple medications increases the risk of experiencing interactions and side effects. We also learned that the benefit/risk profile of medications changes with age. In Part 3 we discuss when polypharmacy can be a risk to your health. We learned in Parts 1 and 2 of this blog that taking multiple medications may increase our risk of experiencing interactions. Sometimes drug interactions can be harmful to our well-being and we don’t even know about it. Many consumers want to know if there is a way to find out about possible interactions ahead of time. In fact there are many online resources and electronic applications (Apps) to help you, or the pharmacist, or the doctor identify drug interactions. These online resources are known as “interaction databases” because they check for ways in which drugs might affect you when they are combined. Even though many programs are available to download from the internet for anyone to use, double checking your situation with more than one source is helpful when using these interaction databases. \xa0You should always talk to a healthcare provider to confirm whether your drug regimen may be associated with the risk of a drug interaction. \xa0The advantage of having a professional review your medications is that it gives the person an opportunity to ask questions. It also gives you an opportunity to talk about any additional concerns which are not really captured by the interaction databases (such as, what is the best time to take the medications). A good study(1) looked at the accuracy of drug interactions in intensive care unit (ICU) settings using three different types of online interaction database programs. The different software evaluated in this study included: This study found that the DR and LI programs showed a good ability to correctly identify the patients with a drug interaction (this is called appropriate ‘sensitivity’). The programs also showed good ability to identify those patients without a drug interaction (this is called appropriate ‘specificity’). So both these software programs available to us on the internet did a good job of identifying potential drug interactions. DIC is offered for free, while LI and DR need paid subscriptions. Other studies have evaluated other interaction databases and these include: These interaction databases also perform well in specificity, sensitivity, ease of use, and completeness depending on the medication interaction examined (2-8). A recent study did a good job of selecting and comparing general online interaction database programs; this study compared different features and found that paid software was better than free software (9). The challenge with all these drug interaction checkers is that it may be difficult to apply the results to your specific situation. While there are many studies comparing drug interaction software, it is difficult to choose one product that is best. This is because each study compares interaction database programs based on one or more specific situations which may not be your personal situation. Another problem is that the programs that check for interactions are based on other studies that record any side effects people may have with a medication. Some of these studies used to describe a drug interaction may be based on very few people or based on studies using healthy volunteers instead of people who have the health condition. As we noted previously, double checking your situation with more than one source is helpful when using these interaction databases. You should always talk to a healthcare provider to confirm whether your medications may be associated with the risk of a drug interaction or side effect.

Risk of drug effects with multiple medications in the elderly: aging changes.","['InPart 1of this blog we presented evidence showing how many older adults are likely to be taking multiple medications (polypharmacy). When we combine different medications, there can sometimes be a risk that they can affect each other in unexpected ways. That is, one medication may influence another medication to potentially give you unwanted effects; this is called an interaction. Sometimes these interactions can be negative and we call these adverse events or “side effects”. In Part 2 of this blog we discuss how polypharmacy affects us as we age. Polypharmacy is not necessarily a bad thing. It is appropriate to take several medications if each one is meeting a specific health need (such as, arthritis, or blood pressure problems). In this case, the benefits outweigh the harms of taking several medications. \xa0However, benefits or harms from a medication may change over time (in the section below, we describe how this happens).So how do we know when polypharmacy does not help? Taking multiple medications can be a problem when: On the one hand, there is good news, as taking multiple medications means that effective treatments exist for many of the health problems that seniors have. However, the risk for side effects increases with a greater number of medications, as well as with increasing age. A recent well conducted systematic review showed that adverse effects from medications occur in 58% of people using five medications (1). Older adults are especially susceptible to adverse effects from medications. For example, some medications can cause problems with your memory and other brain functions (called cognitive impairment), urinary incontinence, or impaired balance. This research shows that any of these consequences can increase the risk for falls in an older adult (1). Polypharmacy is also associated with difficulty remembering to take medications on a regular basis (1). There are two important things we need to understand about our bodies when we are taking any type of medication. The first thing is how our bodies affect the medications– we call this pharmacokinetics. The second thing is how medications affect our bodies – this is called pharmacodynamics. Both of these processes are keys to understanding the benefits and harms of polypharmacy. We consider these two basic processes as we age. One of the most important concerns when taking multiple medications is the risk of interactions. Medications may cause interactions with each other in many ways. \xa0When combined, some medications increase the overall effect on your body. For example, both aspirin and warfarin (a medicine to prevent blood clots) canincreasethe risk of bleeding. When they are used together, the combined effects of aspirin and warfarin increase the risk of bleeding. \xa0In contrast, certain medications, when combined,decreasethe overall effect of each medication. For example, taking an antacid at the same time as an antibiotic, reduces the body\'s ability to absorb the antibiotic; this interaction reduces the effects of the antibiotic. \xa0So, we can see that when some medications are combined, they may produce a “new effect” or interaction that can be helpful or harmful. Every time we take a medication, our bodies go through a series of steps to process the drug, rather like the way we digest food. This process is known aspharmacokinetic. There are several different types of pharmacokinetic processes and these are described below: Thesepharmacokineticprocesses serve to raise or lower the amounts of drug available to exert its effect on the body. Interactions may occur when one drug affects one or more of the above processes, and changes the available amount of another drug. As we age, changes which normally occur in thesepharmacokineticprocesses may affect the risk/benefit profile of medications. This causes older adults to be more vulnerable to medication-related problems. For example, our kidneys work less well as we age; this reduces the ability of the body to eliminate certain medications from our systems (1;2). A medication which is prescribed to a young person may have a different effect as the person ages. This makes it necessary to review the need for, and dose of, that same medication at regular intervals. Our bodies can also affect a medication such that any benefits or harms are changed. \xa0What a drug does to our bodies is called ""pharmacodynamics"". Most importantly, how medications affect the condition for which they are prescribed (e.g. lowering blood pressure or blood sugar) is key.Pharmacodynamiceffects can also cause medication interactions. When two or more drugs are combined they may cancel each other out, which may cause one or all of the drugs to have no benefit. On the other hand, when two or more drugs are combined they can increase the effect of one or both, which may result in a greater effect or more side effects (2;3). Drugs can also interact with food, vitamins and herbal products. For example, grapefruit juice affects the enzymes which break down some cholesterol lowering drugs (e.g. atorvastatin). Grapefruit juice acts to \xa0reduce the metabolism of the drug and increases the effect on your body, similar to taking a higher dose. The opposite effect can also occur, whereby some herbal products (like St John’s Wort used to treat mild depression), increases the breakdown of other drugs (e.g. blood thinning medications like warfarin). In this example, the warfarin is less available to the body, and has less effect. Anotherpharmacodynamicproblem is that some drugs can aggravate specific diseases. For example, over the counter decongestants that may be taken during flu and cold season can cause blood pressure to rise. If a person has high blood pressure, it may be unsafe to take decongestants. Check with your health care professional first! Medications can be very helpful but they can also be harmful. Medications may interact with one another and cause increased or decreased effects. How our bodies affect the medications (pharmacokinetics) is one reason we may get interactions or side effects. \xa0Interactions or side effects can also occur because of the effects of the medications on our bodies (pharmacodynamics). \xa0As one ages the benefit and risk profile of a medication may change.InPart 3, we will discuss what we can do to assess and prevent problems associated with polypharmacy as we age.

Pitfalls of multiple medications: taking multiple drugs and risk of interactions.","[""A growing number of older adults are dealing with more than one medical condition at the same time. Examples include diabetes, hypertension, heart disease, or arthritis (1-3). To manage these conditions, people are often prescribed multiple medications to be taken each day (2;3). They may be taking several different drugs and also vitamins, herbs, and other food supplements. Taking multiple medications and supplements has the potential to lead to several problems. Being on several (poly) medications (pharmacy) is termed “polypharmacy”.A number of different aspects of polypharmacy in the aging population have been studied by researchers. We have prepared a four part series describing some of the most important issues related to polypharmacy . In each of the four parts we will show you how aging and taking multiple medications can sometimes bring about unexpected problems. Part 1 discusses what we mean by the term polypharmacy and why it is important. Although there are different definitions of polypharmacy, the most common definition is the use of five or more medications taken in the previous two days (3;4). Some of the reasons that polypharmacy is a daily routine for older adults include:a) having more than one medical condition,b) easy access to insurance that covers medications,c) easy access to family physicians or other medication prescribers,d) easy access to more and more research that recommends using medication (3), ande) using \xa0medication(s) to treat the unrecognized adverse effects caused by another medication Reliable Canadian sources inform us that polypharmacy is a very common issue in older adults. In 2009 the Canadian Institute for Health Information reported that 63% of older adults took five or more prescription medications every day, and 23% took ten or more medications (5). Medications may cause interactions with each other in many ways. \xa0When combined, some medications increase the overall effect on your body. For example, both aspirin and warfarin can significantly increase the risk of bleeding, so when they are used together, the combined effects increase the risk of bleeding. \xa0In contrast, certain medications, when combined, decrease the overall effect of each medication; for example taking antacids at the same time as an antibiotic reduces the body's ability to absorb the antibiotic, which reduces its effect. \xa0When some medications are combined, they may produce a new effect that can be helpful but sometimes harmful. Many older Canadians are taking multiple medications when they are managing several health conditions. Medications (including vitamins, herbs, and other food supplements) can be very helpful but can also be harmful if there are interactions.This four-part series of blog posts explores various aspects of polypharmacy. InPart 2, we will discuss how aging changes the way our body responds to medications, including when taking multiple medications.Part 3looks at online drug interaction checkers.Part 4examines medication reviews.""]"

How to recognize loneliness as a health concern.,"['Most people feel lonely once in a while, but the feeling usually doesn’t last long. There are, however, some older people who feel lonely quite often – one in five Canadians aged 65 or older indicated that they felt lonely some of the time or often in a recent study (1). The proportion is even higher among those 85 years or older – 25% of individuals in that age bracket felt lonely some of the time or often (1). Loneliness is a distressing feeling that one does not have enough social relationships or not enough contact with people. Researchers have made the strong point that loneliness is not the same as social isolation; social isolation really does mean that you do not have enough people to interact with. Consider two people who have a very small social network. Both these people have no family and only a neighbor stops by for a visit once in a while. Researchers note that one of these people may feel lonely, but the other person does not. On the other hand, a person can have a large family that lives close by, but still feel lonely; this is an example of why sometimes we say that one can feel lonely in a crowd. Loneliness is really about how you think about or perceive your situation. Also, loneliness is not depression; although some lonely people are depressed, many are not depressed. However, loneliness can sometimes lead to depression. We don’t exactly understand this but it is like the chicken and the egg parable; we are not certain which came first. Research shows that loneliness has a number of implications for people’s health. For example, older people who are lonely are more likely to experience a decline in their mobility, compared to those who are not lonely (2). Older people who are lonely also have an increased risk of dying sooner (3). Cacioppo (4), a prominent expert in this field, likens loneliness to social pain; like physical pain it hurts. But loneliness can also serve as a motivational force for change in connection with one’s social relationships. If loneliness is not about having enough people to interact with, then what causes it? One theory (5) is that loneliness comes about because of negative or wrong (called maladaptive) thoughts about oneself and others. People who believe that they are lonely are more likely to believe that other people will reject them. They are also more likely to have low self-worth. If loneliness comes about because of such negative or wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions), then different ways to make this better (called interventions) should presumably focus on changing those perceptions. That is exactly what has been tried in some research studies. For example, participants in one intervention study took part in a workshop. This workshop focused, among other things, on identifying positive relationships from the past, how to apply positive aspects of past relationships to present relationships, and gaining awareness of personal accomplishments. In a review study(5), researchers looked at 50 studies that used a wide range of things that might help with loneliness (called interventions). Some of these studies were designed to change negative or wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions). Some studies looked at other interventions focusing on enhancing social supports (for example, linking to community groups). This review showed that interventions that focused on changing people’s negative or wrong thinking (maladaptive perceptions) indeed were more effective than all other types of interventions. Many older adults are lonely. Reducing loneliness first requires an understanding of a person’s circumstances. Is the person lonely because she is socially isolated and doesn’t have anybody to interact with?  If so, the solution may be to connect them to other people; there are many programs available that serve this goal, such as those easily found in community and senior centres. But maybe the problem is not so much the lack of social connections, but rather the way a person thinks about himself or other people. In that case, research suggests that the focus needs to be on changing negative perceptions.']"

It affects older people during illnesses (such as infections), during hospitalization, or after surgery. It may result in longer hospital stays and is associated with other complications (such as increased risk of nursing home admission). Delirium is a syndrome which temporarily affects a person's thinking. It interferes with the ability to focus, stay on track or shift attention.\xa0 The symptoms often wax and wane during the day, and may disturb sleep. Confusion, forgetfulness, hallucinations (seeing things which are not real) and feeling restless are common (1;2). You may have had the experience of visiting a family member or friend after surgery, and found that they were not quite themselves.\xa0 Perhaps they didn’t remember where they were or why they were in hospital. They may have appeared muddled and said strange things. These symptoms suggest delirium. [For an alternative definition from DSM-5 see text below (3).] There are many causes of delirium, some of which are complicated. Scientific research identifies factors which make delirium more likely to occur. These important factors can be grouped into two main categories: predisposing and precipitating factors.Predisposingfactors are conditions which exist in the patient before the delirium develops.Precipitatingfactors are conditions which are associated with the start of a delirium. Predisposingfactors include (2): Precipitatingfactors include (2): There are two types of delirium. “Hyperactive” is usually obvious as the person is restless, confused and acting out of character. With the “hypoactive” type the person may appear quiet and peaceful. It can be hard to detect delirium, unless a clinical test is used. The most widely studied test is the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) (4). This takes less than 5 minutes to complete, and is able to detect over 90% of people with delirium; the test is negative in nearly 90% of people without delirium. These results make it a very accurate test. The scientific research is not completely clear about the best way to help people with delirium to get better.\xa0 Doctors generally believe that treating the precipitating problem (for example, the pneumonia or dehydration) will help the delirium to improve more quickly. There are also a number of simple things that we can do to help (5): When we look at the research, we have four studies that have used clocks and calendars to help orient patients. One study had clocks and calendars but also added specific talking to the patient (e.g. reorienting them to time and day and other such activities). On the basis of experience, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence group emphasized the importance of family and friends in helping with patient reorientation (5).If the person is “disorientated” (they don’t know where they are or who you are) it is really important to note this; often being disoriented can mean that the person has underlying cognitive impairment or dementia. There are some studies that look at the use of drugs to help people who get really agitated when they are experiencing delirium. The science is not very clear about this but sometimes doctors do choose to use medications to help. Without conclusive evidence, antipsychotic drugs can be used to calm down people who are delirious and are highly agitated, aggressive or at risk to themselves or others (6;7), butuse of these types of drugs is not recommended. The exception to using these is where delirium is the result of alcohol withdrawal, in which case other drugs (benzodiazepines) are the preferred medications. As the causes of delirium are multiple, the most effective ways of preventing delirium involve multiple strategies. The scientific evidence is not conclusive, but shows encouraging results.\xa0 One trend is the use of multi-component strategies which show moderate success in delirium prevention (8;9;10;11).The types of treatments used varied widely within the studies that evaluated the programs. This makes it difficult to determine which parts of the multi-component strategies may be effective. One multi-component program called the Hospital Elder Life Program (HELP) has been evaluated in three studies. This program typically consists of 6 components: In these 3 studies, the HELP program was shown to reduce how frequently people develop delirium in hospital by as much as 40% (12). These studies are a good start, but in future we would need more conclusive studies, (such as randomized clinical trials) to determine if this approach is best. An approach used to prevent delirium after surgery involved asking a geriatrician (a specialist in care of older people) to visit and examine patients after their operations (for example, repair of a hip fracture). The geriatrician made targeted recommendations based on a structured protocol. In one study which used this proactive geriatric consultation, the risk of delirium after surgery was reduced (8).\xa0However, this study was not conclusive, and more air-tight studies are required to confirm these results. Other interventions have been tried, including music therapy and educating the health care staff. For these the scientific evidence is weak, with only two studies supporting them (13). A recent study though, with a few scientific problems, suggests a large positive effect in reducing the development of delirium in hospital. This randomized controlled trial showed that family members may reduce the risk of a person developing delirium by as much as 50% (14).This clinical trial involved the following: The scientific evidence for all of these interventions to prevent delirium is still not conclusive. However, some of these strategies seem simple and inexpensive to implement.""]"

We live with others, and we support each other; that’s what has given us an evolutionary advantage. So what happens when a person doesn’t have others to be with – when they are socially isolated? Older people are especially at risk of being socially isolated. By the time people reach their eighties, the majority live on their own, mostly because of widowhood. This is particularly the case for older women who are more likely to be widowed than older men.  Older people’s social networks often get smaller for other reasons as well – children may have moved away, along with grandchildren, and aging siblings and friends may have died. For many decades, researchers have been interested in social isolation and what impacts it has on people’s health. One question that has been looked at is whether people who have more social relationships or more supportive relationships live longer than those with fewer or less supportive ones.  In these studies, people are asked about their social relationships at one point in time; some years later, researchers follow up and determine who is still alive and who has died in the meantime. In one study (1) researchers reviewed 148 studies that had previously looked at social relationships and mortality.  Across the 148 studies, people with more or better social relationships lived longer. Other research has looked at what kinds of social activities people participate in and what health effects they have on them. For example, in a large and well conducted study (2), people were asked about social activities they engaged in, like visiting relatives or friends or participating in groups such as senior centres. They were also asked whether they had any disabilities. About 5 years later, people were interviewed again and asked again about their disabilities. From this, researchers were able to determine who had become disabled since the first interview. The researchers found that more socially engaged people were less likely to have become disabled (43% less likely), and this even after taking other important factors into account, such as physical activity. We need to be somewhat careful in interpreting these findings, though, because it is possible that other factors are at play. People who are socially isolated may be different from those who are not in many other ways besides social isolation; for example, genetically, in their behavior, or in some other way. Researchers try to take many of these other possible factors into account in their studies, but they can’t take all factors into account. This means that we can’t say social isolation is a cause of health problems; all we can say is that it’s a risk factor that increases the likelihood of experiencing health problems. The research evidence is less clear about what we can do to reduce social isolation. The obvious answer would seem to be to get people connected to each other and many programs are available that try to do just that. For example, there are many clubs or senior centres that allow people to get together. We lack good evidence, though, that shows that such programs in fact reduce social isolation and, ultimately, produce health benefits. We also don’t know whether they reach those most at risk of being socially isolated. If people don’t come forward on their own it can be a challenge to identify those who are socially isolated and help them to become more socially engaged. Many older adults are socially isolated. This should be of concern to all of us, as family members, caregivers, service providers, or neighbours. We need to watch out for older people who live alone, who hardly ever go out of the house, who hardly ever get visitors. Making a phone call to or visiting a family member or checking on a neighbour doesn’t take much time, but could make a big difference in somebody’s life. Communication via the internet also makes it increasingly easy to stay in touch across geographic distances. And there are many organizations that provide opportunities for social engagement, such as senior centres. Service providers should be aware of these opportunities and refer their clients that may be socially isolated to them.']"

I went to see him with a new health problem. This was on top of my other medical problems that included arthritis of my hips, heart problems, and bladder issues. That’s when my doctor talked about “multimorbidity”. I wasn’t quite sure what the “M” word really meant, except that my doctor seemed worried, wanted to talk to my pharmacist and asked me to come back for another visit the next week. I discovered that the “M” word really means that you are living with three or more chronic diseases. I certainly fit into this category but so do a lot of other seniors and older Canadians. Living with multiple chronic conditions (also means “multimorbidity”) affects a growing number of people. Across the country, approximately 29% of Canadians are living with one chronic condition but 15% have two chronic conditions, and 7% have three or more chronic conditions. However, living with “M” is something that is more likely to affect older people. For example, in Ontario, 43% of adults over the age of 65 had two or more chronic conditions (1). Living with “M” can create some challenges for yourself, as well as your family and friends. For example, each of the chronic conditions may involve seeing different specialists, all prescribing 2 or more different medications, so the total number soon adds up. Sometimes the help of family and friends is needed to make sure we can get to all the different doctors’ appointments. It also makes it hard for your family doctor to take care of people when they have “M”. Many of the care guidelines for managing chronic diseases don’t consider people who have anything other than the single medical problem. \xa0It is also difficult for your doctor to keep up with some of the changes to your care when so many other specialists and health professionals are involved. A recent evidence brief (2) looked at the “M” problem and described what some older adults already experience. Overall this evidence brief showed that “M” is a complicated issue and a tricky thing to study. Some of the problems not only involve the people who have “M”, but also the family doctor, and the healthcare system. In some people who have “M”, it has a significant impact on their quality of life (2). The scientific evidence is not clear about the most important risk factors for people who have “M”. As pointed out in a recent evidence brief , the evidence does suggest that people living with “M” are more likely to die early (3), experience poor clinical outcomes (4), have poorer quality of life (5), experience loss of physical functioning (6;7;8), and have difficulty with getting and keeping employment (9). Twosystematic reviews(4;10) compared studies that included combinations of things that might help people still living in the community who have “M”. Although the studies were difficult to compare (so many different problems and interventions) there were a few promising things that might help prevent problems. The studies that focused on making changes to particular risk factors (for example, on things that put you at risk for falls) or making changes to improve your activities of daily living (for example, physiotherapy), tended to be more helpful overall. We don’t have much scientific evidence yet, but building up a stronger social network (friends, family, etc.) can also have a protective effect (11). In some people who have “M”, it has a significant impact on their quality of life (2), and this means it can be hard to: The “M” problem also costs our healthcare systems a great deal of money and resources, which has gained the interest of many policymakers. Even though only a small percent of people (7%) have 3 or more health conditions, it seems to have a big financial impact on our health system. One study of high-needs users of the health system in Ontario showed that 1% of the population accounted for 33% of Ontario’s healthcare costs and 5% of the population cost our system about 66% of all expenses (12). As we age, the problem of multimorbidity can be a growing concern as more people will have 3 or more different chronic medical conditions. Living with so many health conditions can be complicated for the person with the health issues and for their healthcare providers. It will be important to work on strategies to coordinate your care and get these providers communicating with each other to ensure the best care.']"

Social isolation and urinary incontinence: there are many effective treatments.","['Have you ever heard anyone say, “If I laugh too hard, I’ll pee my pants!”?\xa0 This well-known expression derives from the difficulty many women and men have controlling their bladder as they age. Any involuntary urine loss, no matter how small an amount, can be referred to as urinary incontinence. Unfortunately, incontinence is no laughing matter for over half a million Canadian seniors (1). Often stigmatized and considered a taboo subject, few people chat comfortably about the fact that they need to wear pads in their undergarments to protect against urine loss, or that they dribble on the way to the toilet. Worse, waking up in bed and finding the sheets wet with urine can be devastating.\xa0 This is especially a concern if you have a bed partner, or if incontinence occurs during sex. The trauma of wetting your pants in public is not easy to wipe from memory. The solution for many people is to stay at home alone and isolate themselves socially, in order to avoid public shame. A recent report by Statistics Canada (1) indicated that 53% of older women with incontinence report being lonely compared to 38% without incontinence. Among men, 34% with incontinence admit to feeling lonely compared to 24% without incontinence. Loneliness and social isolation can lead to depression, heightened stress levels and trouble sleeping. The tragedy is that incontinence can be treated at any age, yet few people know this. The first step to treatment is education. Changing beliefs that incontinence is NOT a normal part of aging is very important (2). Having your local community center organize a public lecture around incontinence is effective for activating older persons with incontinence to apply evidence-based strategies to reduce risk factors for leakage (2;3). Dispelling the myth that incontinence is a shameful secret you have to live with also stimulates help-seeking from a continence professional for this problem (2;3). Reducing caffeine intake, practicing pelvic floor muscle exercises (often called Kegel exercises), and losing weight are strategies that can be applied to improve incontinence symptoms (4-7). Lest you think very old people cannot be cured, there is proof that a ninety-eight year old woman was cured with simple solutions: she limited the number of\xa0 caffeinated beverages she consumed (caffeine stimulates the bladder to contract) and performed pelvic floor muscle strengthening exercises daily for 6 months (4). This may not be possible for everyone, but if you don’t try you will never know! There are several self-management tools for urinary incontinence and the link to one type is on the McMaster website.\xa0 It is available free of charge if you would like to see what your risk factors are for incontinence (click here) (8). The tool will provide suggestions on how to improve your situation, based on the latest scientific evidence. Even more effective, why not have your local community organization give a public lecture on incontinence; it would be a good idea to hand out the self-management tool to all who attend. This community approach seems to be very helpful in showing people that there are many solutions. A recent clinical trial demonstrated that a community approach was effective for reducing urinary symptoms in 1-out-of-every 2 older women with incontinence (3). Alternatively if you experience incontinence, speak to a health professional, a physiotherapist or a continence nurse advisor immediately. Many conditions are not curable as we age, but incontinence is!\xa0 Wouldn’t it be great to be able to laugh freely without worrying about peeing your pants?']"
