Six per cent have been diagnosed with dementia.It says 11 per cent more seniors over 80 have maintained a driver’s licence, although part of that increase may be because all older motorists are no longer required to take an exam to determine if they are healthy enough to operate a vehicle. Mackenzie said up to 96 per cent of seniors had passed the exam anyway and the change may be more in keeping with a healthier population that is living longer.Inspections of long-term care homes by health authorities were down by 11 per cent over the period covered by the report, but Mackenzie said that was expected during the pandemic.“Normally, B.C. has very high rates of inspection, well over 80 per cent, and we are seeing that is returning.”—The Canadian PressRELATED: Home care for B.C.’s elderly is too expensive and falls short: watchdogCoronavirusSeniors"

Finally the minister announced a one-time payment, but it’s not until May,” Blaney said during Question Period. “Seniors are in desperate need now to stave off hunger and eviction. Again I am asking, will the minister support seniors at risk and immediately release emergency funds?”The question prompted Seniors Minister Kamal Khera to respond, saying “we both share a deep desire to support those most at need seniors. I am very pleased to share that we are now going to be able to deliver payments to those who saw GIS reduced ahead of schedule as early as April 19.“Service Canada will also be working with members of parliament to help constituents in dire need to get support sooner, in March, and we will continue to be there to support seniors with our increases in pension funds,” Khera said.The federal government had announced that they would provide an emergency payment to seniors cut off the GIS during the fiscal update last fall, but the initial announcement was that financial help wouldn’t be available until May. MPs Blaney and the NDP finance critic, Daniel Blaikie, advocated for more urgent help for more than 183,000 seniors affected.“Seniors can finally breathe a sigh of relief after going through a horrible, unnecessary ordeal,” said Rachel Blaney. “For months, I have been hearing the most heartbreaking stories from vulnerable seniors who felt abandoned by this government. The pandemic has just been devastating for our country’s seniors and, instead of getting extra support, they had the GIS help cut from them for accessing the pandemic aid they desperately needed. New Democrats spoke out against this injustice from the beginning and I’m so happy to see that the government is finally taking action to fix their mistake.”RELATED:More questions than answers in new GIS announcement — MPsSeniors to wait five months for GIS one-time paymentmarc.kitteringham@campbellrivermirror.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

Paul became a resident at the centre on Dec. 19 2021 after treatment for cancer at Kelowna General Hospital.“They put in a space heater at that time and looked into the problem with the heating system which I believe was ongoing because the pieces for the units in the room were laying on the floor,” said Fanelli.She contacted the Community Care Facilities Licencing department at Interior Health (IH) which is in part responsible for ensuring regulations are met in licensed child care programs and child/youth and adult long-term care facilities.She and other families later received an email that the heating system was fixed prior to a Zoom meeting between families and Spring Valley management on Jan. 13. Fanelli said she had asked management to remove the space heaters before that meeting.“They didn’t remove the space heaters, because the heating was not fixed,” she said.During the meeting, Fanelli asked what was happening with heating in the building and was told the boiler system was not working but the heat had been restored. But that was not the case according to Fanelli and she asked again for it to be fixed.“They said, at that time, there was no money in the budget for the next year to do any repairs for heating and cooling systems in the building.”Fanelli again went back to IH licencing, and also contacted the Patient Care Quality Office (PCQO) at IH. She then reached out to B.C. Seniors’ Advocate Isobel MacKenzie.“I got a nice email back saying thanks but we’ll add you to the list of problems,” she said.Fanelli added the PCQO has since closed her file because they have no ability to enforce it because of current legislation.Capital News contacted Park Place Seniors Living, which owns Spring Valley, and was provided with a written statement by VP Operations, Kathy Nduwayo:”In December 2021, a concern was brought forward to the management of Spring Valley Care Centre regarding a room where the heating system had just failed. During this period, the Okanagan was experiencing record-breaking cold temperatures that impacted many aging buildings across the health care system and Spring Valley Care Centre was not spared. Due to extreme temperatures, the building’s heating system struggled to keep up with demand in an isolated part of the building.The comfort and safety of Spring Valley’s residents are paramount to all members of our staff. In response to this issue, on-site management immediately implemented an interim solution to bring the temperature up to a more comfortable level in the affected part of the building. Heating system improvements are underway.Multiple options have been provided to alleviate any safety concerns in this matter. All involved regulatory stakeholders were immediately informed and brought in to assist. These stakeholders include Patient Care Quality Office, Kelowna Fire Department, Interior Health Authority, and residential care licensing. Each has indicated they are satisfied with the plan to address the heating issue.We wish to assure all residents, families, and the larger community of our commitment to providing a safe environment and quality care to our residents.”Fanelli has also contacted Kelowna-Lake Country MLA, Norm Letnick for help.“We have communicated via my office,” said Letnick. “I won’t get into the details of a private matter with a constituent, but what I can tell you is the issue was recently forwarded to the health minister. We’ll wait to hear the minister’s response to our correspondence.”Fanelli has started apetitionto mandate senior care home maintenance in B.C.“I want them fined, I want them held accountable, I want full disclosure to all people who have a vested interest in the healthcare of their family members.”Read More:Laid-off Campbell River employees face-off with Island Health directorsRead More:Do we now fully comprehend the extent of care home neglect in Canada?@GaryBarnes109gary.barnes@kelownacapnews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitterand subscribe to our daily"

More than 13,000 adults aged 50 and over participated in the study from 2008 to 2018.At the first interval, the researchers recorded initial measures of health and wellbeing. They also captured aging satisfaction through participants’ responses to statements like “things keep getting worse as I get older”, “I am as happy now as I was when I was younger” and “The older I get, the more useless I feel”.At the second interval, they assessed aging satisfaction again.Then for the third interval, researchers measured how health and wellbeing outcomes had changed four years after the second measurement of aging satisfaction.Of the 35 outcomes they measured, 27 had improved in association with improved aging satisfaction four years earlier.Some of those outcomes included all-cause mortality, number of chronic conditions, diabetes, stroke, cancer, heart disease, lung disease, arthritis, physical functioning limitations, cognitive impairment, chronic pain and self-rated health.Participants with the highest aging satisfaction showed a 43 per cent reduced risk of all-cause mortality.At the same time, decreased satisfaction with aging from the first to second intervals was linked to worsening health and wellbeing outcomes.“Prior research has looked at how psychological risk factors like depression and stress might adversely influence health and wellbeing outcomes, but we are interested in factors that might positively influence health and wellbeing outcomes,” said Julia Nakamura, a graduate student in UBC’s department of psychology and first author of the study.“With further research, our findings suggest that interventions to increase aging satisfaction might improve the health and wellbeing of our rapidly growing older adult population.”Nakamura added that interventions could come at both the individual and societal levels. She suggests efforts to combat ageism and stereotypes would be a good first step to improve the way people view aging.“If a person thinks aging is destined to be a negative experience, that might become a self-fulfilling prophecy.”READ MORE:UBC research group launches online toolkit to combat stigma around dementiaREAD MORE:Advocates say lengthy COVID isolation for seniors in care may do more harm than good@SchislerCole"

That will be too late for many seniors going hungry, struggling to pay for medication and experiencing homelessness.“It’s absolutely unacceptable for the government to make them wait until May for help,” he said. “That’s why we’re asking the minister to get money out the door and into seniors’ pockets now.”In December, Freeland announced a “top up” of $742 million that would be going to seniors affected by the claw-back, but those funds would not be available until the beginning of the federal government’s fiscal year in April.The issue has been compounded by inflation, which was reported at a new 30-year high of 4.8 per cent by Statistics Canada this week.“I have heard heartbreaking stories from seniors across the country. They’re living through an unprecedented global health crisis; they’re already stressed and frustrated, and then the government cut the GIS support they rely on to survive. If that wasn’t bad enough, the cost of necessities like food is getting higher and higher. Seniors need help now more than ever,” said Blaney.“Instead of having people’s backs like Justin Trudeau said they would during the election, this government has cut their financial support and refuses to act quickly to fix it.

These pets can even end up euthanized in extreme cases if no one adopts them.That’s why ElderDog also offers both temporary foster homes for dogs if their owner has to be away for medical care and assistance with permanent re-homing, filling a gap between existing organizations like shelters.READ MORE:Unwanted pets flood Victoria animal welfare group as society returns somewhat to normalWith more than 30 clients already in the region, the non-profit is now placing its focus on growing its presence in the Sooke area. Sooke-based volunteer Linda Harris said a big part of why they have not done so sooner is a lack of volunteers in the area.But with some recent additions, she said they now can start adding clients.“My sense, and our sense as an organization, is there is potential for some high demand in the Sooke area,” said Harris. “It is a very dog-friendly community. There is also a pretty decent base of seniors in the community, so there are probably quite a few people out there that could use a hand in making sure their dog has the opportunity to get out for a good walk.”A volunteer for the past two years, Harris said she’d been impressed with the organization from the onset. She gets to spend her volunteer time with dogs outside in the fresh air only makes the experience better.Volunteers work with each client to meet the specific needs of their dogs. For Harris and her client’s dog Lilly, this typically involves half-hour walks where Harris follows Lilly on whatever route she decides to take that day.In addition to dog care positions, Harris said there are also opportunities for people to volunteer for the organization’s promotions and social media, event and administration areas.Anyone interested in learning more about volunteering or accessing ElderDog’s services is encouraged to visit elderdog.ca or email elderdogvictoria@gmail.com.READ MORE:Colwood makes new park stairs paw-friendly@JSamanski"
9,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/advocates-say-lengthy-covid-isolation-for-seniors-in-care-may-do-more-harm-than-good/,"Jan 20, 2022",Advocates say lengthy COVID isolation for seniors in care may do more harm than good,"After 10 days of preventive COVID-19 isolation in her room at a Montreal care facility, Joanne Béland’s 84-year-old mother has more difficulty moving and expressing herself.“My mother, she told me, ’I don’t know if I’ll still be able to walk when I’ve finished my 10 days,’” Béland said in a recent interview, adding that her mother now struggles to get out of a chair.“It’s very difficult for them to maintain their mobility when they’re confined in a room for 10 days.”Béland’s mother, Lorraine, lives at the Ressource de la Montagne, an “intermediate” care facility in Montreal, which offers a higher level of care than a seniors residence but less than a traditional long-term care home.Like in other residential care facilities in the province, residents are required to isolate for 10 days if a worker or another resident on their floor tests positive for COVID-19.Béland, who chairs a committee representing residents at her mother’s facility, said she agrees COVID-19-positive residents should isolate. But she says she worries a 10-day isolation period for others on their floor causes more harm than good.Earlier this week, the users committee at the health authority in west-central Montreal, which runs the facility where Béland’s mother lives, sent a letter to Quebec’s health minister and the seniors minister, calling for the isolation period to be shortened. With high vaccination rates in residential care facilities, and evidence that the Omicron variant causes less serious illness, the physical and mental health impacts of the isolation period are too high, the letter said.“The majority of seniors, they’ve already had their third dose of vaccine, they’re well-vaccinated,” Béland said. “It doesn’t make sense to keep them in this condition, to confine them in their rooms for 10 days.”Béland said she doesn’t think residents who may have been exposed to COVID-19 should be free to move anywhere, but she said residents should at least be able to move around their floors — especially if they test negative.Her mother tested negative twice for COVID-19 during her 10-day preventive isolation, Béland said. “After two negative tests, it seems to me we could give them the chance to leave their rooms.”For doctors who work with elderly patients, whether to reduce the preventive isolation period is a difficult question.Dr. Sophie Zhang, co-president of an organization that represents doctors who work in long-term care facilities, said that while Omicron may be less serious than other mutations like Delta, it can lead to severe illness and death, especially among elderly people who are already sick.“The question is, yes, whether preventive measures are worse than the actual infection,” she said in a recent interview. “It’s kind of tough to answer and I think it becomes kind of an ethical question, rather than a scientific question.”Zhang, who oversees 15 long-term care centres in south-central Montreal, said measures like the isolation period may have to be rethought because of the widespread transmission of COVID-19 in the community.At one facility where she works, an outbreak was declared on Dec. 19 and has not yet ended, as new cases continue to be reported among staff members.“Once there’s an outbreak, we put in place a lot of measures — restrictive measures — on visits, on activities, on mobility within the facility,” she said. “So all that is taking a heavy toll on our patients’ quality of life.”For people who are older and sicker, not moving or moving less can cause loss of muscle mass even after a few days, she said. Reducing the isolation period, implementing more aggressive testing and changing the way outbreaks are defined all need to be considered, Zhang added.Dr. Quoc Dinh Nguyen, a geriatrician and epidemiologist at the Centre hospitalier de l’Université de Montréal, said that especially in larger facilities, residents can have their 10-day isolation periods reset when new cases are reported on their floors.Nguyen said in a recent interview that testing could be used to lift isolation periods sooner. Facilities, he added, could also take into account their specific risk levels and the ability of residents to follow measures. A regional approach may make more sense than a provincewide isolation policy, he added.“We need to worry about the adverse effects of isolation measures,” Nguyen said, adding that he also worries about the impact of relaxing measures too much.“Although I agree that it’s not as severe as it used to be, it’s still severe,” he said about the Omicron variant. “We still need to be careful and we still need to put measures to reduce transmission.”—Jacob Serebrin, The Canadian PressRELATED: B.C.

10,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/new-canadian-care-home-standards-to-emphasize-fact-that-they-are-homes-not-wards/,"Jan 12, 2022","New Canadian care home standards to emphasize fact that they are homes, not wards","The expert spearheading new draft national standards for long-term care says they must strike a difficult balance between residents’ safety and their quality of life.The pandemic devastated long-term care homes across the country as thousands of residents fell ill and died, and laid bare the deficiencies people in the sector have warned about for years.The federal government requested the new standards in the 2020 throne speech, and CSA Group, previously the Canadian Standards Association, is set to release a draft for public feedback in February.They will be based on consultations with experts, stakeholders and interest groups across the country.Those consultations revealed a tension between infection prevention and the social, emotional and mental well-being of residents, said Alex Mihailidis, chair ofthe technical subcommittee developing the new standards.“We are not designing a hospital, we’re not designing an acute care ward,” Mihailidis said in an interview with The Canadian Press.“We are designing people’s homes and for many of them the last home they’re going to live in.”A report on the CSA Group’s consultations showed many of the policies and procedures employed during the pandemic to protect residents from the virus did so at the expense of their mental and social well-being.Infection prevention specialists from the acute care sector were dispatched to long-term care during the pandemic and sometimes requested changes that limited the residents’ quality of life, the report said.In one example, specialists suggested personal items be removed from the rooms to make them easier to clean and disinfect. But residents’ cherished possessions should instead be considered essential, the report stated.Mihailidis said striking that balance as part of a national set of standards has been tough.The CSA Group standards will touch on everything from the heating, ventilation and air cooling systems and plumbing to the use of technology and infection prevention.While the standards are intended to make sure long-term care centres are safe, he said they will be guided by people-centred care, equity, diversity, and inclusion.Some suggestions that came up during the consultations involved kitchens that residents can use themselves, single-occupancy rooms, dementia-friendly design elements, gender-neutral washrooms, and dining rooms that allow for physical distancing.The standards also need to accommodate homes of all sizes and types all over the country, so they will not be overly prescriptive, he said.They are being developed in conjunction with the Health Standards Organization, which will focus more on the care provided in the homes.It’s not clear how the government plans to enforce the standards once they are finalized and published in December, however.In his mandate letter late last year, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau instructed Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos to negotiate agreements with provinces and territories to improve the quality and availability of long-term care homes.He also ordered his minister to develop federal legislation to ensure the safety of seniors in long-term care, though the homes fall under provincial jurisdiction.“Really, at the end of the day, we need the buy-in from the provinces and territories,” Mihailidis said.— The Canadian PressRELATED: Loved ones turned away from B.C. senior homes, advocate saysRELATED: Key sectors facing staffing struggles amid escalating pandemicCOVID-19Seniors"

I’m very worried about that and we’ll continue to fight on that for sure.”The NDP are also calling on the government to reinstate pandemic supports for workers, particularly as the Omicron variant is spreading rapidly. New public health orders in Quebec have already affected workers, and according to a NDP press release “the Liberal government’s plan to provide aid to Canadians doesn’t cover people affected by partial lockdowns.”“Canadians are tired of the pandemic—we’re all tired. But Justin Trudeau can’t just decide he’s finished providing pandemic supports to people when provinces are recording thousands of new cases per day,” said NDP finance critic Daniel Blaikie. “We pushed back against the government’s inadequate proposal for pandemic supports because we knew it would leave too many people behind and that’s exactly what is happening right now.“This government has got to help those workers whose hours have been drastically reduced. They have to help the self-employed people who have no idea how they’re going to keep paying their bills.”New Democrats are urging the Liberal government to reinstate pandemic supports for workers and small businesses and to make meaningful changes to the Employment Insurance program for Canadians.RELATED:Time running out to fix GIS cut before holidaysNDP Critics concerned about seniors losing Guaranteed Income SupplementCampbell RiverNewsSeniors"

Once their work stopped as the pandemic took hold, many then applied for emergency benefits, which caused their GIS to then get cut back.“The Liberal government stood by and said their hands were tied when the richest companies took pandemic support to pay bonuses to wealthy executives or to pay dividends to rich shareholders,” said NDP finance critic Daniel Blaikie. “Instead of making the wealthiest pay back the help they took and didn’t need, the Liberal government is going after our country’s poorest seniors and putting them in an impossible situation.”“Working seniors already struggle to make ends meet,” Blaikie said. “Denying them the GIS, or severely reducing it, as a result of last year’s emergency benefits is not only unfair but will make it impossible for some of them to make rent. The point of the emergency benefits was to prevent evictions and keep food on the table, not to merely delay homelessness and hunger.”According to the release from the NDP, Singh also has raised the issued in private meetings with the Prime Minister, and MPs have written letters to the government since August. They have also asked for an emergency debate and stood in the house to address the problem.“One senior wrote to us to say that not only was he failing to make ends meet with a drastic cut in his GIS payments, but he’s also dealing with a recent cancer diagnosis – and an upcoming eviction on December 23, that’s two days before Christmas if the Liberal government doesn’t reverse this cruel decision hurting him and some of our country’s poorest seniors,” said Blaney. “The Liberal government promised to have people’s backs for as long as they needed help. Seniors helped build this country and they need us to have their backs now more than ever. If we fail to fix this, thousands of seniors might be out on the streets in the coldest time of the year. We can’t let that happen.”RELATED:NDP Critics concerned about seniors losing Guaranteed Income SupplementCampbell RiverFederal PoliticsNewsSeniors"

It determines whether it can reimburse a customer for claimed items once it confirms items were damaged as a result of a crash involving an ICBC-insured vehicle, and that the loss is payable under that vehicle’s third-party liability policy.Generally, in the case of property damage claims, ICBC asks customers to provide some important pieces of information:• Itemized quotes of the damage;• Photos of the damaged property;• Age of the damaged property;• Original receipt of the damaged property, if possible.“In this particular case, once we received the information needed from the customer, we were able to proceed with the property damage claim,” ICBC said in a statement.reporter@comoxvalleyrecord.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"
19,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/no-euthanasia-in-quebec-care-homes-during-covid-19-expert-tells-coroners-inquest/,"Nov 2, 2021","No ‘euthanasia’ in Quebec care homes during COVID-19, expert tells coroner’s inquest","A coroner’s inquest into deaths in Quebec long-term care homes during the first wave of COVID-19 was dominated Tuesday by debate over whether medicating certain residents to alleviate their suffering amounted to euthanasia.The discussion came a day after a doctor from Montreal’s Jewish General hospital told coroner Géhane Kamel that some of the long-term residents who died of COVID-19 would likely have been saved with oxygen or rehydration treatments.Dr. Vinh-Kim Nguyen testified Monday such treatments weren’t always available in the understaffed and under-equipped long-term care homes, adding that there were “numerous obstacles” preventing doctors from transferring residents to hospital. Instead, Nguyen said the only available treatment in the homes was often respiratory-distress protocols intended for people at end of life, which consisted of a strong cocktail of drugs used to reduce suffering.“These are protocols that lead to death … it was in fact euthanasia,” he testified on Monday.On Tuesday, another witness, Dr. Marjorie Tremblay, insisted the protocols don’t cause death.Tremblay, a palliative care specialist who developed the protocol, said the medication was used to ease suffering. Its effects include “controlling respiratory rhythm,” “managing anxiety,” and controlling and preventing rattling in the lungs, she said. In the case of COVID-19, she added, the medication also helps prevent contagion by reducing coughing.Tremblay said the treatment can be stopped if the patient improves.“We have to stop thinking that morphine kills,” she told the inquiry. “It’s COVID that killed the patients.”The protocol pioneered by Tremblay specifies that there should be continuous evaluation of the patient’s state based on several criteria and under the supervision of a doctor.But on Tuesday, both Kamel and another coroner assisting her, Dr. Jacques Ramsay, questioned whether the directives were always followed to the letter during COVID-19’s first wave.“Your protocol implies a medical presence, which was not always necessarily in place,” Ramsay said, expressing concern that some patients’ symptoms may actually have stemmed from conditions such as dehydration.Because the protocol itself doesn’t cure patients with the virus, it is only supposed to be given to patients who are assigned to a lower level of care after refusing more aggressive treatment.But Kamel pointed out that in a chaotic situation, the usual checks and balances are not always in place.Witnesses have told the inquiry that workers at long-term care homes had called residents’ families to convince them to agree to a lower level of care for their loved ones, often without explaining the consequences of that choice.Kamel said Tuesday that Tremblay’s protocol presumes that families have been properly consulted and the patients’ levels of care have been properly reviewed. But she pointed out that the reality during COVID was that doctors “weren’t present for the most part,” and that families were no longer allowed inside the care homes.Kamel strongly suggested tightening the rules surrounding the use of the protocol.The coroner’s inquest is examining the deaths of elderly and vulnerable people who died in residential settings during the first months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The intent is not to assign blame, but to come up with recommendations to prevent similar tragedies.About half of Quebec’s COVID-19 deaths during the first wave occurred in long-term care homes, and some 92 per cent of people who died between Feb. 25 and July 11, 2020, were 70 and older, according to the province’s public health institute.—Clara Descurninges, The Canadian PressRELATED: ‘Beyond what’s humanly acceptable’: Testimony ends at Quebec long-term care inquestCoronavirusSeniors"

She will next hear recommendations before filing a final report.Lynne McVey, head of the regional health board that took control of Herron on March 30 as COVID-19 cases mounted, testified that authorities did what they could to save lives.Appearing before the inquest for a second time, McVey was questioned Tuesday about why it took so long to realize how many people had died at the private facility.She said the information was only discovered on April 10 after additional verifications. The inquiry has heard that no one appeared to be tabulating deaths at the suburban Montreal facility.McVey told the inquiry she was scared when she learned that at that point there had been 31 deaths, prompting Kamel to interject that there should have been an accounting earlier.“If we had the choice between saving lives and registering deaths, I don’t think you can fault nurses on the ground for going to a bedside rather than registering deaths,” McVey said.She was also questioned about the timing of a 911 call to police, coinciding with a Montreal Gazette report that appeared outlining horrifying conditions at the residence. One day later, provincial officials announced the 31 deaths.Kamel also noted the 911 call came after health authority staff had been on site for two weeks.McVey said perhaps she should have called police earlier, but she acted after several pieces of information came to light, including the 31 deaths and a report about a disorganized pharmacy counter at the residence.“Calling the police isn’t a crime, and it’s a certainly a situation we’d never gone through in our careers,” McVey said. “We found 139 patients with zero staff, it was unthinkable.”McVey also defended a letter sent to Herron management that informed them the regional health authority was assuming management on March 30. When Kamel said the letter left little room for collaboration, McVey described the situation as “desperate times (that) called for extreme measures.”She noted the situation at Herron was different than other residences where the health authority had assisted and owners handed over staff lists and patient files within an hour.Later, asked by the lawyer representing some deceased Herron residents whether she took responsibility, McVey put the blame on the virus. “COVID-19 is the most devious virus I’ve had to deal with in my clinical career,” she told the inquiry. “The virus has a large responsibility in these deaths.”She later told families she was sorry for the deaths, that the objective had been to provide care to residents.“We went there to help, and we would have really wanted to save everybody,” she said. “There are 18 witnesses that came through here and many of them are still very traumatized by not being able to save the lives that we wanted to save during the pandemic.”Earlier Tuesday, Kamel said she was tired of finger-pointing between health authority managers and Herron officials, noting both sides were accountable and responsible for the vulnerable patients under their care.The health authority’s deputy director also took the stand for the first time during the inquest.Najia Hachimi-Idrissi testified that the health authority was unable force three doctors assigned to Herron, who were seeing patients through telemedicine as COVID-19 cases mounted, to treat patients on site.She also maintained the health authority could not oblige unionized employees to report for work at Herron, which is why non-unionized managers were the first to arrive at the understaffed facility to help.—Sidhartha Banerjee, The Canadian PressRELATED: Coroner’s inquest begins into Montreal-area care home where dozens died of COVID-19CoronavirusQuebecSeniors"

Salter said she wanted to give a voice to people who felt they couldn’t about working and living conditions in the two homes. (SUSAN QUINN/ Alberni Valley News)More than 75 former staff members, supporters, family members and at least one resident protested last week in front of Fir Park and Echo Village for better conditions in the long-term care facilities.Many of the protesters’ signs brought attention to staffing issues at both of the facilities, calling on the Alberni-Clayoquot Continuing Care Society (ACCCS)—which oversees both homes—to take action.Denis Sauve, a former City of Port Alberni appointee to the ACCCS board, said he attended the protest to speak up for staff and clients at both facilities. “We’re being a voice for staff members that are being intimidated and don’t want to come forward,” Sauve said.“It’s been ongoing for a long time. There’s staff shortages that need to be addressed, the workers that are working—the nurses and care aides—are working long hours and that’s one of the grievances put forward. But mostly you’ve got residents, you’ve got your loved ones in there and they haven’t had a bath for a week or two or three and it’s just unheard of. That’s what we’re trying to address, is to get the proper care.”Staff members were not involved in the protest, however, some of them stood across the street to watch the proceedings, including a union member with the Hospital Employees’ Union (HEU). None of them were willing to speak with media.A union spokesperson with the HEU confirmed for another news outlet that more than 100 grievances have been filed by staff members at both Fir Park Village and Echo Village. Sauve said the grievances are one of a number of concerns.“The fact that 100 grievances have been made by the staff, and none of them have been addressed in a timely fashion is not right,” Sauve said. “And staff members here have a collective agreement to be able to deal with these grievances, but they’re being ignored.“Now we have many workers on both sides that are worried to come forward. They don’t want to come forward because they’re worried about retribution.”Mark Chase has lived at Echo Village for 11 years. He rode his electric scooter among the protesters with his own sign proclaiming that he had been threatened with eviction because he spoke out about conditions inside the home.“I’m here to stand up for the staff and residents that can’t speak their piece,” he said. “I’ve been here for 11 years. I’ve seen what it was before, to what it is now. There’s no comparison: it’s just gotten worse and worse. Staff aren’t happy and I’m here for them.“They’re so short-staffed they can’t run properly with what they’ve got.”Kristy Salter organized the Aug. 31 protest after seeing a television news report where people aired their grievances. Salter, an education assistant (EA) with School District 70, said she is not a healthcare worker but she knows several people who work in Fir Park and Echo Village.“After receiving all these private messages from current staff members that are too afraid to speak because they’re worried about repercussions, I decided I would create this event and hopefully gather enough support to make this out in the open for the community,” Salter said.HealthcareIsland HealthPORT ALBERNISeniorsseniors housinggoogletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-14');gptRefreshSlots.push(14); });"

Since the purchase, a number of single-family homes and lots and a multi-family apartment complex have been built on the 23-acre site. A series of duplexes and fourplexes are currently under construction.READ MORE: Housing gap widens in Port AlberniEarlier this month, District announced that they had sold a 2.5-acre property to Vancouver Resource Society (VRS) Communities Society to develop a non-profit housing complex for seniors and persons with disabilities. The property is located at Anderson Avenue and North Park Drive.“Excited to see this sale complete as it facilitates a quality and well-needed development of seniors housing in our community,” Port Alberni Mayor Sharie Minions posted on social media after the announcement. “Thank you to the District Group and Vancouver Resource Society for their work on this project.”VRS is a non-profit society that operates 11 sites around B.C. that provide accessible housing for seniors, families and people with disabilities.Port Alberni city council has approved a development permit for VRS to build a five-storey, 102-unit, apartment-style complex of independent living suites. The complex will also include a clubhouse with amenities, such as a dining room, lounge, commercial kitchen, bistro, e-learning centre, fitness room, games room and community gardens.“This is a very innovative concept for independent living,” explained Brad Tone, the VRS director of development. “We’ve created a clubhouse that is community-oriented in nature. This is something that seniors have been asking for.”The units will all be one- or two-bedroom units that are accessible to someone in a wheelchair. Units will be fully independent, with a full kitchen, but seniors can choose meal services and housekeeping services as needed. They will also be pet-friendly.“Pets are a part of the family,” said Tone.Tone said the building will be “primarily” for seniors, but it is also open to other people with disabilities who need somewhere accessible to live.The building will not be an extended care or long-term care facility, said Tone, but there will be care aides in the building to provide some services.District president and CEO Michael Nygren said that District had been in discussions with Port Alberni city council about the need for seniors housing in Port Alberni.“We’re so pleased to have sold this property to such a community-focused organization as VRS and look forward to see them realize this much-needed housing option for this area,” said Nygren. “A project of this nature and size will have a lasting social and economic impact for the city of Port Alberni and the Alberni Valley.”Ken Fraser, executive director for VRS, said the society had been looking into Port Alberni for a while because it has one of the highest rental market saturation rates in the province. This refers to how quickly new properties fill up after construction.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Fraser liked the site because of its proximity to services (such as shopping and the local Echo Centre) and because of its park-like setting, surrounded by trees and trails.“We just felt it was perfect for this kind of use,” said Fraser. “Sites of this quality seldom come available and we were looking to bring this much-needed housing offering to Port Alberni and the Alberni Valley.”Fraser said that the City of Port Alberni has been “fantastic” to work with so far.“You have some great community leaders that got behind us early on,” said Fraser. “Without that, this wouldn’t be able to happen.”RELATED: Former ADSS property sells to Vancouver-based developersVRS is currently working with BC Housing on the financing aspect of the facility, after which construction will be able to begin. The VRS website currently estimates a 2023 opening.“We are basically shovel-ready on this,” said Tone. “We’re very optimistic that we’re going to be moving ahead very shortly.”Fraser explained that the units will not be subsidized, but he is planning for them to be affordable.“We’ll be extremely competitive,” he added.There are two components to the cost: the regular rental, as well as a service package (including things like housekeeping and meal service). Fraser said that VRS will first be targeting people looking for that package.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“We’ve done a lot of research and connection with people in the community,” said Tone. “We think this is going to be good for Port Alberni. Seniors need an age-in-place solution that allows them to come in at any point in their lives and live independently. When the time comes that they need more services and facilities, they’re right there in the building for them.”VRS is planning to launch a website atwww.timberlinenorthpark.comwhere people will be able to learn more about the housing project.

The former meant relief benefits would be deducted from low-income seniors’ guaranteed income supplement (GIS), while the latter did not.Pandemic benefits for those in the second camp “can be excluded from their income amount when applying for GIS,” the directive states.Starr Therrien, a 63-year-old Ontario flower shop owner who lost her husband in November and was slated to receive his income supplement, finds herself cut off for the coming year from $8,400 largely due to the CERB she drew on for three months in 2020.“Why wasn’t there a flag when people like me were collecting the CERB?” she asked in an interview.“I know the government was really strapped for time … But there were no warnings saying, ‘These are the implications, you need to be aware of this 12 months from now and how it will affect your life’ — $8,400 is a lot of money, no matter who you are.”Conservative MP Rosemarie Falk said the situation could have been prevented with clearer communication and a more streamlined bureaucratic process, calling the clawbacks “unacceptable.”“Despite meeting the eligibility requirements, these seniors have been arbitrarily penalized based on the stream these funds came through,” Falk wrote in a letter dated Aug. 9. to Seniors Minister Deb Schulte.The $2,000-per-month CERB amounted to “two entirely different relief programs, distributed by different government agencies and with different eligibility criteria,” though seniors were never informed, she said.“Your government must rectify this situation for the sake of the financial stability and security of our most vulnerable.”While the dual-stream complication did not come to light until this week, opposition legislators say they’ve been flooded with calls from Canadians aged 65 and up who suddenly saw their monthly budget tossed out the window amid drastic dips in government supports due to the pandemic benefits they relied on last year.Green MP Paul Manly highlighted the “costly ramifications of forcing low-income seniors into greater poverty” in a July 29 letter to Schulte, National Revenue Minister Diane Lebouthillier and Employment Minister Carla Qualtrough.New Democrat MP Daniel Blaikie called last week for a “prompt solution” after many seniors who received the CERB and its successor, the Canada Recovery Benefit, either do not qualify for the income supplement or face drastic deductions to it.Like employment insurance, the guaranteed income supplement is income-tested. That means the previous year’s taxable earnings — including most emergency benefits — factor into how much gets doled out in the next payment period (recipients are notified of their entitlements each July).“This may result in a loss of entitlement if the person’s income (or joint income, where applicable) exceeds the threshold at which GIS benefits are completely phased out,” said Employment and Social Development Canada spokesman Samuelle Carbonneau in an email last week.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });The split-program wrinkle added another line to a sometimes garbled calculation.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“For simplicity of communication to the public, the two programs were communicated as one Canada emergency response benefit. The objective was to ensure that Canadians applying for either income support … were treated in a similar manner,” states a May 12 note in the Canada Gazette, the official record of government decisions.As CERB began to roll out, information relayed by CRA call centre agents on self-employment income was “unclear and incorrect,” resulting in improperly stated earnings, the note says.Jack Partridge, 77, said he lost $350 in monthly GIS after drawing on four months’ worth of CERB when his hours were severely cut back at the technical sales centre where he does maintenance and warehousing work.“I was never told,” said the resident of Brantford, Ont.“They say it’s going to all even out in 2021. That may be fine and dandy from their standpoint. But it’s not fine and dandy from my standpoint.”For single seniors, GIS benefits kick in if they make less than $18,984 annually, with a monthly maximum of $936. The eligibility threshold for couples is $45,504.Data on the total number of GIS recipients who had their payments reduced this year is not currently available, Carbonneau said.Seniors continue to receive their full old age security and CPP pensions.—The Canadian PressRELATED: Seniors cut off from federal income supplement after receiving emergency benefitsCoronavirusfederal governmentSeniors"

There was nothing about having your pension cut in half for the next two years.”Sherlock is not the only one blindsided.New Democrats say they’ve have been flooded with calls from Canadians aged 65 and up who suddenly find themselves cut off from monthly government payments due to the pandemic benefits they relied on last year.In a letter sent to three Liberal cabinet ministers, NDP MP Daniel Blaikie said many seniors who received the CERB and Canada Recovery Benefit either do not qualify for the guaranteed income supplement or face drastic deductions to it.“They’re just not going to have enough income at the end of the month in order to pay their bills. And what we feared would happen last year will end up happening this year,” Blaikie said in an interview.“It’s not right of us to do this to Canada’s poorest seniors.”Blaikie is calling for a “prompt solution” and hoping that the federal government will change its approach to slashing the guaranteed income supplement based on benefits.“I don’t think it’s a good enough answer to say, ‘Well, this is the way we normally do it, and so that’s the way it’s done,’” he added.“We’ve been making all sorts of exceptions over the past year and a half in recognition of the fact that circumstances are not normal and people are struggling with unprecedented challenges.”Like employment insurance, the guaranteed income supplement (GIS) is income-tested. That means the previous year’s taxable earnings — including emergency benefits — factor into how much gets doled out in the next payment period (recipients are notified of their entitlements each July).“This may result in a loss of entitlement if the person’s income (or joint income, where applicable) exceeds the threshold at which GIS benefits are completely phased out,” said Employment and Social Development Canada spokesman Samuelle Carbonneau in an email.For single seniors, GIS benefits kick in if they make less than $18,984 annually, with a monthly maximum of $936.Data on the total number of GIS recipients who had their payments reduced this year is not currently available, Carbonneau said.Seniors continue to receive their full old age security and CPP pensions, which in Sherlock’s case add up to $783 after the government knocked nearly $500 in GIS off his monthly income. The two pension streams are now his main source of financial support through June 2022, and do not cover his rent and utilities.Sherlock said he put last year’s emergency benefits toward dental work, car repairs and old bills, but he hadn’t budgeted for a smaller income as a consequence of the CERB and its successor, the CRB (he stopped receiving the benefit a few months ago).“I’ve got no money and I can’t pay my rent,” he said.“It’s sort of like if you saw a little old dog in the street, offered it a treat and then hit it on the head with a baseball bat for taking that treat.”Those a decade older than Sherlock have a slightly bigger cushion to fall back on.Starting the week of Aug. 16, the government will provide a one-time payment of $500 to every senior who will be 75 and over by the summer of 2022.And come next summer, the Liberals are also proposing a 10 per cent boost in old age security for those over 75, which the budget estimated would provide an extra $766 in benefits to 3.3 million retirees.—Christopher Reynolds, The Canadian PressRELATED: NDP demands federal wage-subsidy clawbacks, but critics question feasibilityFederal PoliticsSeniors"

It would take another $5.2 billion to ensure spending on home care amounts to no less than 35 per cent of total spending on long-term care.That’s all over and above the $23.7 billion provincial and territorial governments spent on long-term care and home care in 2019-20. Giroux’s report also estimates the funding would have to increase by more than four per cent a year to keep pace with Canada’s aging population and inflationary pressures on wages.The report, based on a motion put forward last March by Green MP Paul Manly, comes as a federal election appears imminent and political pressure is high on Ottawa to help provinces fix a dilapidated system that was ravaged by COVID-19.Bonnie-Jeanne MacDonald, a research director at the National Institute on Aging at Ryerson University, said nobody should be surprised by the size of the figure, but added it’s time for Canadians to have a conversation about “what kind of Canada do we want people to age in.”“Do we want the same fallout we saw happen in the last year to happen again?” she asked.Manly said he thinks Canadians will be watching closely to see what parties offer to do for long-term care in the next election, noting it’s an issue not just for seniors living in care homes now, but also for their families, and for those seniors and older adults looking at their own options for the not-too-distant future.“I think that people clearly want to see things fixed,” he said.The pandemic raced through hundreds of Canada’s long-term care facilities, infecting more than a quarter of the 205,000 residents and killing more than 15,000 of them. That is more than half of Canada’s total COVID-19 death toll.A report from members of the Canadian Armed Forces deployed to help staff care homes in Ontario and Quebec last year listed shocking conditions in some of the hardest hit facilities, including cockroach infestations, poorly paid and trained staff, residents left to sit in soiled clothing for hours, and others sleeping in crowded rooms, with little effort at all at infection control.MacDonald said that report confirmed what those familiar with the system had known for years. But she said the pandemic didn’t just blow the lid off any illusions Canadians had about the standards of care homes for vulnerable seniors, it made most Canadians think they didn’t want to ever live in one.A survey taken by the National Institute on Aging in July 2020 found almost 100 per cent of those asked said they had no interest in going to a long-term care facility, and as many as 70 per cent said that decision was influenced by the pandemic.Federal and provincial governments have flocked to promise billions to fix the problems, and the PBO report does not take those into account in its analysis.But MacDonald said the conversation may need to be more specific about whether adding beds and building more homes is the answer, or if we should be doing far more to help Canadians age at home. There is a time and a place for long-term care homes, such as for people with dementia who can’t safely live independently, she said, but most Canadians would prefer to live out their lives at home.—Mia Rabson, The Canadian PressRELATED: COVID-19 exposed a long-term care system already in crisisHealthSeniors"

As one document notes, the system delivering the old age security program either has to change or the payments themselves would need to be delivered through an outside system to account for people turning 75.Employment and Social Development Canada, in a written response to questions, said the systems supporting the delivery of old age security are being modified to consider the date of birth of the pensioners and adjust the monthly payment for all seniors when they turn 75 or older starting in July 2022.—Jordan Press, The Canadian PressRELATED: Boost to seniors benefit this summer and beyond could cost $10.7 billionFederal PoliticsSeniors"

It gets them outside for fresh air and exercise.”The garden includes a colourful variety of flowers, as well as tomatoes, kale, head lettuce, green onions, peas carrots, radishes and cucumbers, to which residents help themselves.It’s also a favourite spot for hummingbirds, thanks to a number of feeders donated by Luv-A-Rug, a Victoria carpet cleaning company that’s raised $15,000 to provide feeders and birdhouses for care facilities throughout the Capital Region.“The joy we receive seeing the reaction of the residents – some are very depressed, especially during the pandemic – and the smile on their faces when they come down to the garden to see what we’re doing is so rewarding,” Konrath said.Elsa Bryan, 83, said she had a beautiful garden years ago and made a few suggestions to Konrath regarding what flowers to put in.ALSO READ:Colwood parks alive with music Friday nightsTed Buchanan, 95, jumped at the opportunity to get involved. “I started gardening with my mom 90 years ago and never gave it up,” he said.Other garden club members include Gordon Knill and Ted McMaster.The club is organizing a garage sale to raise money for a tool shed and to purchase more plants for fall and summer. “We don’t want to ask the residents for donations again because they were so helpful getting us started,” Konrath stressed.The public is invited to drop by the garage sale at Alexander Mackie Lodge at 753 Station Ave. on Saturday, July 24 between 9 a.m. and noon.

One way they’re lending their help is through delivering three nutritious meals to seniors every Wednesday afternoon.Since it began, the volunteers involved haven’t missed a single week of deliveries to those in need.“I really enjoy being a part of the community. If you have the time and resources to come out and help, it’s really an awesome group. It’s a small commitment for a big outcome,” said Lillian Davies, SVSS volunteer driver.The program is funded by the United Way of Greater Victoria and began early on in the pandemic. The contract that allows SVSS to provide the food sits with James Bay New Horizons where contracted caterers prepare the meals in a commercially approved kitchen.The meals are then delivered to the SVSS office at Cedar Hill Golf Course, where 10 volunteer drivers pick up the meals, using their own vehicles to deliver the package of three meals to each client. This also creates an opportunity for seniors to have social contact when their meals are dropped off.“The nicest thing is, for lots of people who can’t get out or aren’t able to fix a more complex meal, it allows them three days a week where they have that nutrition and it does a lot to boost their spirits,” said Peggy Hancyk, client outreach support at SVSS.Other ways that SVSS is serving older adults in the community is by driving them to appointments, companionship visits, delivering food hampers, light yard work, helping with minor home repairs and preparing income tax returns.If you’re interested in volunteering or know someone who could use the services offered by SVSS, visitsaanichvolunteers.org/.Do you have a story tip?

It similarly found the specific terms “elder abuse” and “elder neglect” were rarely used in legislation.The paper noted that one of the central issues in defining elder abuse was whether it could only be limited to actions by a person in a position of trust, like a caregiver or relative, or could include acts by strangers as well.“It’s really a barrier for collecting data and collaboration if we’re not all working from the same frame,” Schulte said.The government’s consultations will run until July 22, and next week Schulte and Justice Minister David Lametti are scheduled to hold virtual roundtables on the matter.—The Canadian PressRELATED: How to avoid scams targetting seniorsFederal PoliticsHealthSeniors"

A first-class teacher’s certificate would follow.“I came out to Sea Island (now part of Richmond),” following the Second World War draft, Jauck said, having enlisted in the Canadian Air Force as an information clerk and a teacher with the education unit. “We lived in tents at that time. There was nothing there,” he recalled. “My job was to teach basic math for those who wanted to move ahead.”An infantry kit inspection on Sea Island, B.C., 1939 (Department of National Defence)Jauck would make trips to Vancouver’s Lutheran Church as permitted, where he met and would marry his wife. The two would “flip around” between Sea Island, Boundary Bay and Horseshoe Bay at the whim of the Air Force, he said, before settling in Vancouver to raise a daughter and a son following the war.Jauck retired as an administrator at the former Pearson Hospital at 60 and moved to Victoria.“I’ve always been a public person. Starting with teaching and then being a hospital administrator,” he said. “I try to be involved.”By 1985, Jauck held board member positions with the DeMezey Memorial Legacy Society at Abbeyfield House, the Anawim Companions Society and Kiwanis Club of Victoria. For the latter, Jauck would help oversee the development of nearly 100 senior housing units, one shelter for boys and another for single parents.Pensions for health and education lent themselves to Jauck’s creation of the pioneering mental health program, Friends of Music.“It was for people who had worked on or could do very good music, but had isolated themselves,” he said. “The idea is that if you don’t want to talk to anybody, (and) you play a fiddle in a group … you finally say to your neighbour, ‘I think you’re off-key’ or something like that,” he laughed.With time, the group would include a group for banjos, violins and an orchestra. They continue to play today with an offering of lessons and performances in-person or over Zoom.ALSO READ:Making meditative music for mental healthThe Friends of Music during 2004’s Victoria Day parade.

Since then, Jauck said, local grade schools have implemented their posture methods for students.Since the passing of his wife five years ago and taking up new residence in Saanich at Trillium, Jauck is proud of his role in improving the social clubs at his retirement home. He helped institute “happy hour” for discussion, and enjoys a cup of coffee or a glass of wine most days at 4 p.m..ALSO READ:Trillium Village opens with 60-unit ‘boutique’ additionWhen asked about his favourite thought to sit with after 103 years, Jauck said to start with, it’s the people.Do you have a story tip?

56,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/qualicum-beach-resident-calls-driving-exams-for-seniors-aged-80-and-up-unfair/,"Jun 1, 2021",Qualicum Beach resident calls driving exams for seniors aged 80 and up ‘unfair’,"A Qualicum Beach resident believes B.C. exams for drivers aged 80 and up to be unfair.With Parksville Qualicum Beach having one of the oldest demographics in Canada, Judy Southern, who has been involved with the Qualicum Beach Senior’s Activities Centre for nearly 20 years, said she has heard seniors discuss the “unfairness” of the exams.“One must arrange an appointment with a doctor… if they have a doctor and then pay for it,” said Southern. “Doctors charge, at their discretion. If one is lucky the doctor knows you well and may not feel that you need a follow-up cognitive test or road test.”RoadSafetyBC, the B.C. government’s agency responsible for road safety, mandates persons 80 and above to renew their driver’s licence every two years. They are required to get a medical examination report to be completed by their physicians.The medical report includes checks for cognition, eyesight and overall physical health. Medical Services Plan does not cover the cost of the exam which varies anywhere from $50 and up depending on the physician.RELATED:B.C. takes new approach to testing older driversThose that fail the medical exams, however, may end up having to take the Enhanced Road Assessment to determine whether they are fit to drive. It is free of charge but it takes a 90 minutes to complete and includes a pre-trip vehicle orientation, a 45-minute on-road drive and a post-trip review.RoadSafetyBC indicated a driver cannot pass or fail an enhanced road assessment. It’s just a process to determine the person’s fitness and ability to drive.Southern understands that as people age, some cognitive abilities change. She also agrees that all provinces do require a review of a senior’s driving. However, she claimed that British Columbia has the “least humane” and “most expensive” system of any province.“The road test for seniors is twice as lengthy as for any other age group,” said Southern. “Some seniors who have never had problems driving suffer extreme anxiety at the process – and, sadly, failure is pretty much guaranteed.”Jason Watson, communications manager for the Public Safety and Solicitor General Communications Office, indicated that RoadSafetyBC’s goal is to allow people to drive for as long as they safely can.“The primary tool we use to assess driver fitness is the Driver’s Medical Examination Report, which a physician completes,” he said. “Doctors charge a fee for this exam, and they’re entitled to set the amount, which can vary – but Doctors of BC recommends that physicians reduce or waive the fee for patients who are experiencing economic hardship. This has been the approach in British Columbia for at least a decade.”Watson pointed out not all medical information received from the DMER leads to road testing or further action by the Superintendent of Motor Vehicles.RoadSafetyBC sends about 70,000 examination reports to drivers 80 and over and statistics every year and data shows that 98 per cent keep their driving privileges.Parksville resident Dennis Belliveau had a business he sold recently that required him to drive to various locations on Vancouver Island. He is 84 and has had to deal with the RoadSafetyBC mandate. But he doesn’t have any problems with the RoadSafetyBC requirements.“I’ve have not encountered any challenges at all,” said Belliveau. “The first step of that process is a medical and I have gone through that on both ocassions and had no problems with that. I get a few questions from my doctor. I drive a lot of miles so I have to be very careful. I do 50,000 kilometres a year.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Belliveau said he reads the ICBC guidelines and driving instruction books to keep himself updated with the latest requirements. He advises other seniors to do it as well.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });“I want to make sure I am up to speed on all aspects and the reason I pay attention to my driver’s licence, my business depends on me to have a valid licence,” said Belliveau. “If I don’t have one, my business is dead. I can’t go out. So I can’t afford to lose my driver’s licence at least up until a couple of weeks before I sold the company.”Belliveau acknowledged there may be some seniors who find the current process difficult. But at this time, he said, he’s had no issues.Southern wants to collect feedback from the public to help raise this matter with the government.“You might not be 80 years old right now but someday you will be,” said Southern.She said there is a plan afoot to gather people on the steps of the Parliament Buildings in Victoria to protest the unfairness to seniors once the COVID-19 pandemic is over.“I replied that I was certain we could add substantial numbers from the (Parksville Qualicum Beach) area,” said Southern.Feedback or concerns can be emailed to Southern atjnsouthern@shaw.ca.Currently, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Watson said, RoadSafetyBC temporarily stopped issuing routine age-based DMERs on Dec. 16.“We want to support the ability of medical practitioners to respond to priority medical cases affecting seniors and other during this difficult time.”Michael.Briones@pqbnews.comLikeusonFacebookandfollowusonTwitter"

Unfortunately, older adults still find themselves in vulnerable situations where they can experience various forms of abuse and neglect.The association shared the story of Shirley to illustrate the extent of the issue.The staff at a coffee shop Shirley went to every day noticed her appearance changing over a period of a couple of weeks. She was becoming unkempt and appeared to be cold, dirty and hungry. When the staff approached to see if they could help her, Shirley said her son had taken over her house and she was now living in the basement without proper cooking or bathing facilities.

It was in good shape then, but over those next 50 years it laid to rest in fields and bushes.I remember our kids when they were small playing in it, putting sand down the carburetor and it was just junk to me. “You’ve got to be kidding,” I remember saying in 1998 when Gerry told me of his plans to get it going again.Well little by little it became his project, many times putting it aside as I was complaining of the mounting cost. But Gerry saw it differently.I went along with it; he did a lot of work himself, and then in April 2020, we made the decision to get it professionally finished. I cursed every time I saw a bill and Gerry would say, “It’s worth it.”It’s 2021, and the 70-year-old Mercury is home now in the carport (I didn’t give in for keeping it in the garage and kicking my car out). It still needs a little work on a few things, which I am sure Gerry will do, but I am hoping it gives him years of joy.Gerry’s hope had been to complete it before his mom died in 2001; he wanted her to have the first ride, as she was a big part of why we are here on the farm today. That never happened, but today we parked the truck beside the Cees and Miep Hof Park on Cherry Point Road across from the farm. Suddenly the sun shone through, I felt her saying, “Well done son, it looks fantastic.”This moment ended with, “Hop in Mary; I will take you for a ride.”— submitted by Mary HofFor more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.RELATED: Port Alberni Uptown neon landmark restoredRELATED: Victoria’s Craigdarroch Castle kitchen area being restored to pre-1919 stateSeniors"

There was no one in sight as she lay flat on her face.“I was daydreaming instead of watching my feet,” she said. “I just lay there, glasses mashed against my face, unable to move. Eventually, I was able to turn on my side and then sit up when this young fellow came to my aid. He asked if I was alright, if I wanted him to call 911 and offered to help get me up.“When I managed to get on my knees and hands he knelt and offered his knee for support on which to put one hand so I could push myself up with the other. He said that he was trained in first aid and his quiet assured manner proved that he had learned his skill well.”Magee said he took a first aid course about a year ago. He and other students were at the park during a physical education class playing a game of ‘Capture the Flag.’“I’d just gone in to check if there was somebody hiding in the bushes,” he said. “When I saw her face down in the dirt, it was like ‘oh, gosh.’ I run over and I guess instinct just kicked in.”Bright did not require medical assistance, but suffered bruising on her face, mid-section and leg. Magee stayed with her to ensure she could make it home.“When I was once again on my feet, he continued to assist me, identifying my abrasions and pouring his water over the scrapes on my hand,” Bright indicated. “When I could walk again and felt ready to move towards home, he walked with me for a good part of the way, quietly pointing out the hazards, until he felt that I could safely continue on my own.“Throughout, I could best describe his behaviour as gentle professionalism, far more than I would expected of someone his age.”As a retired secondary school teacher from Ontario, Bright has seen the good in young people far more than the opposite.“I’d say nice students are the majority and the bad apples make it difficult,” she said.Bright did not ask for the student’s name at the time so she made an effort to track him down the day after the incident. She wrote a letter to Chemainus Secondary School and learned Magee was the young man who helped.An informal ceremony was set up outside the school and Bright made the cash presentation to Magee and thanked him publicly again.And what’s he going to do with the money? “Keep it in my wallet till something comes up,” Magee said.“May good karma go with him,” enthused Bright.For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.RELATED: Good Samaritan climbs B.C. tree to rescue eagle impaled on branchRELATED: Parksville senior on scooter, stuck in snow, gets a tow homeHikingrescueSchoolsSeniorsStudentsNancy Bright displays bruising around her eye.

In response, the province implemented lockdown protocols for those seniors, to keep them safe and healthy.“This year has been challenging for all of us, but the challenges for those living and working in long-term care and their loved ones have been among the greatest we have faced,” said Henry.“Now that the most vulnerable among us have received a vaccine, we are safely amending restrictions to give people in long-term care greater opportunities to connect with the people they love.”People living and working in long-term care and assisted living were among the very first to receive COVID-19 vaccinations as a part of B.C.’s strategy to use vaccines to protect those most vulnerable to severe illness first and reduce transmission in high-risk settings.RELATED – Staff shortage during B.C.’s deadliest COVID-19 care home outbreak: reportMORE: Canada’s long-term care residents got less medical care in 1st wave of pandemic: reportHave a story tip?

He’s done little picture montages of different scenes that will twig their reminiscent memories as well.”Tony Woods, Eden Gardens’ longtime cook, also said Wittkofski’s “amazing” work is valuable.“It makes a difference in the residents as they can go back and look at these and it makes a big difference for the staff too because we don’t all get to engage in all of these things and see what’s going on … it takes a big thing for a person to volunteer their time to come in make everyone else’s day a little bit brighter,” said Woods.In terms of his feelings about the award, Wittkofski said he was caught off-guard.“I’m more embarrassed than anything because I really feel like what I’m doing here is so insignificant compared to what the people who work here do,” Wittkofski said. “That was my whole rationale for getting involved in this, because when I first came over and you see the love and care that these people [give] 24 hours a day … I thought I should be able to do something here.”For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.RELATED:Eden Gardens’ calendar features Beatles-inspired picREAD ALSO:B.C. gov’t to allow more visitors at senior care facilitiesREAD ALSO:Eden Gardens wants to make new forest trail more accessiblereporter@nanaimobulletin.comLike us onFacebookand follow Karl onTwitterandInstagramCoronavirusHealthcareSeniorsVoluteers"

The increase is projected to cost $490.6 billion over the next 10 years.CMA president Dr. Ann Collins says the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed “major cracks in seniors’ care,” adding that improvements beyond “tinkering around the edges” are needed.The study highlights potential solutions that could lower the cost of services, noting a downward trend in the use of long-term care by seniors.The CMA says 37,000 Canadians could be diverted from long-term care by 2031 if that trend is sustained by making better use of home care. The move would result in an estimated savings of $794 million per year.The doctors’ group says it is using its report to press the federal government for new demographic-based annual funding to the provinces and territories to support improving elder care, as well as a pan-Canadian plan to improve elder care in Canada.“It is not hard to imagine what awaits (seniors) in the next decade with no plan in place to address a growing demand for care along with changing expectations for aging at home,” Collins said in a release.ALSO READ:COVID hospitalization costs $23,000 per stay, four times as much as average: CIHIThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

So we called and contacted a bunch of facilities and we are hoping to get between 10 and 15 birdfeeders put around these properties for the seniors to enjoy some birdwatching.”Anderson reached out to the various senior care residences, care homes and assisted living facilities in the Valley, and had numerous responses from interested groups.Kiwanis Village, Comox Valley Seniors Support Society, The Junction, Cumberland Lodge, Stevenson Place Independent Living and the Immigrant Welcome Centre all received birdhouses.“It’s amazing even during COVID how much collaboration this (project) involves,” said Bakker. “This is a part of schooling we don’t think about and school administrators have given the leeway to pursue the project.”Students involved in the project said the experience was fulfilling and are pleased their bird feeders are being given to seniors who have been isolated.“I prefer a balance between bookwork and hands-on learning because it is good for creativity,” Jacob Price said.-With files from Comox Valley SchoolsEducationSeniorsLake Trail Community School cohort of Grade 6-7 students constructed 50 bird feeders for distribution throughout the community to various care homes and assisted living facilities.

The commission is slated to deliver its final report at the end of April.More than a quarter of the country’s long-term care homes are for-profit, according to the Canadian Institute for Health Information.READ MORE:NDP announces plan to cancel up to $20K in student loan debt per CanadianThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

The company said a study of more than 17 million patients who received the vaccine did not identify any blood clots that were caused by the vaccine, and Thrombosis Canada also issued a statement saying the vaccine was safe.Léger executive vice-president Christian Bourque said concerns about the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine don’t seem to be on Canadians’ minds.“For now, there’s no real major issue exactly (with the AstraZeneca vaccine), but could it in light of what we’ve seen over the past couple of days? I don’t know,” Bourque said.The online poll of 1,512 adult Canadians was carried out March 12 to 14 and cannot be assigned a margin of error because internet-based surveys are not considered random samples.The poll also found that 41 per cent of respondents say they believe the worst of the COVID-19 crisis is behind us, while 25 per cent say we are now in the worst period.Bourque said Canadians seem to feel that we’re rounding the corner as vaccination campaigns are accelerate across the country.READ MORE:Trudeau offers reassurance on AstraZeneca safety as European countries suspend useMia Rabson and Maan Alhmidi, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

But now, that guitar, and the connection it revived, has gone missing.Michael Vecchio struggles with dementia. Two years ago, the now-75-year-old asked his daughter Connie Vecchio to bring his prized guitar, which he’d owned for almost 50 years, to his Castlegar care home, Talarico Place.Connie, who lives in Kelowna, did so without hesitation. Michael would pick up the guitar to play during subsequent visits, and Connie said he’d become “himself again.”“He sees the guitar… And then he’d sort of start bobbing his head, and before we know it, we’re in a moment,” Connie said.The last time Connie visited her father in his room was February 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic changed visitation protocols. The guitar sat on a stand in the corner of his room beside two amplifiers.Care home staff recently informed Connie they couldn’t find the guitar. Checking a basement storage area, staff located the amps and the stand, but no trace of the guitar.Not knowing what to do, Connie posted her story to Facebook. She said the community response has been immense, with people even offering to give Michael a new guitar. But, “unless it’s a cherry Guild Starfire,” Connie said it just wouldn’t be the same.“That’s the guitar,” she said. “… It’s that thing that brings somebody back.”* VINTAGE GUILD STARFIRE GUITAR MISSING FROM CARE HOME IN CASTLEGAR *RCMP FILE # 2021-719Thank you to the community…Posted byConnie VecchioonThursday, March 11, 2021Michael bought the guitar in the ’70s off of Nick Keraiff — better known as Buddy Marr, the frontman of a popular Kootenay band called the Versatiles. Ever since then, he’s kept the guitar in impeccable shape. Guitars of a similar ilk have been listed in online marketplaces for more than $2,000.Connie has filed a police report and is offering a no-questions-asked $1,000 reward for the guitar’s safe return. Those with information can reach out to Connie on Facebook or the guitar can be dropped off at Johnny’s Gas in Robson, B.C., which is owned by one of Michael’s friends.“I’m so hopeful somebody will just return it to my dad and help him have some happy moments in his last chapter.”READ MORE:COVID vaccination party at North Okanagan retirement communityREAD MORE:COVID-19 vaccine protects health staff, seniors best after three weeksDo you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?

73,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/b-c-s-oldest-covid-19-survivor-celebrating-105th-birthday/,"Mar 14, 2021",B.C.’s oldest COVID-19 survivor celebrating 105th birthday,"Throughout her long life, Vernon’s Dorothy Chura has fought many battles, and overcome countless obstacles. Her most recent victory: a fight against COVID-19.At 105, she is believed to be the oldest person to survive the virus in B.C.It’s for this reason her upcoming 105th birthday will serve as an extra-special milestone.The Heritage Square resident will celebrate her birthday on March 16, 2021. Born in Witko, Sask. in 1916, the beginning of Chura’s story predates her move to Vernon by nearly a century.Given that she’s lived through multiple World Wars and other global catastrophes — as well as personal health scares and poverty — her survival of the novel coronavirus is almost unsurprising.Almost, if not for the fact that U.S. Centers for Disease Control data suggests people aged 85 years and up have a fatality rate 7,900 times higher than people from ages five to 17 — and the risk is much higher among centenarians.Seventy people, 47 residents and 23 staff tested positive and nine people died following an outbreak at Heritage Square. Although Chura was also infected, she fought through. The outbreak, which was announced in late December, was declared over mid-February.“She has always been determined to overcome the challenges of her life even as she aged, and she has,” Dorothy’s daughter, Diane, told the Morning Star.Chura’s first major life alteration came at the age of five when her mother passed away,Her father moved to the United States to re-marry. Chura was placed in eight different foster homes before landing in a family whose patriarch would not allow her to go to school, instead sending her to work the farm.Such was life in the Prairies for an orphaned girl, until she got married on Aug. 6, 1938 to Peter (Pat) Chura at the age of 21.As the oldest of five children Peter had been forced to leave medical school to help his mother and siblings, when his own father suddenly died. He later became a teacher — it was a cheaper and easier profession to get into then.Following this, the young couple moved around Saskatchewan. Dorothy took part in local theatre activities, and also took the spotlight.“Reportedly she was a gifted actress,” her daughter says.When they arrived in Toronto in 1942, Dorothy proved herself an “exceptional seamstress” and talented hair stylist, but with her husband’s purchase of confectionery and lunch restaurant, she reinvented herself in the city as a businesswoman. And she was good at that, too.“It was hard work with long hours, but they made it thrive,” Diane said. “Dorothy proved to be a natural businesswoman and through her contacts, wheeling, dealing, and great resourcefulness managed always to procure items no other store could find.”One lunch confectionery became two, but in the interest of sparing themselves from extremely long hours, they sold the business — only to go the Empire route.The Churas moved to Hamilton, Ont. and bought the Empire Motel. They had a daughter in 1949, who came to them between two hotel purchases after they relocated to Brantford and bought The Strand, a prohibition-era hotel, which suffered damage from a major fire that levelled several businesses on the block. Pat returned to teaching.READ MORE:COVID vaccination party at Armstrong retirement communityREAD MORE:COVID-19 vaccine protects health staff, seniors best after three weeksThe couple had been married almost 50 years when in the late 1980s Pat became sick. An earlier diagnosis of arthritis later manifested itself as prostate cancer.“Dorothy nursed him lovingly at home for as long as she was able, but the disease was too far progressed.” Pat died at St. Joseph’s Hospital in Brantford in 1988.“The loss of her life partner was traumatic,” her daughter said. “Still, Dorothy carried on valiantly for many years in Brantford after he passed, continuing to be an active member of her church community in the company of her friends of so many years and created a new life for herself.”In 2007 Dorothy moved to Vernon to be nearer to Diane and son-in-law Wayne Wilson. But the strain and magnitude of the change took its toll, and she suffered a heart attack.“However, Dorothy has always been a remarkable survivor, and triumphed in true prairie fashion,” her daughter said.Chura stayed spry as a centenarian. At 100 years old she maintained her flower pots, bowled weekly, took long walks, did leg lifts daily to maintain her figure and avidly read the papers. Diane says she still dressed fashionably, got her hair done every Saturday and looked younger than her age. She watched the news on TV to stay informed about a world her generation had long since passed on to the next.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });She moved into Heritage Square in Vernon — which she has come to love — after breaking her hip in 2019, and a day before her 104th birthday the retirement residence went into full COVID-19 lockdown.Pandemics are said to be once-in-a-lifetime experiences. While Chura likely doesn’t remember the Spanish Flu of 1918 having been just two years old at the time, she’s one of few to live through multiple global outbreaks.That’s worthy of a toast come March 16th.Brendan ShykoraReporter,Vernon Morning Star"

The research to be funded won’t necessarily be pandemic-related.The funding comes on top of some $1 billion the Trudeau government has plowed into research since COVID-19 started sweeping the country a year ago, in a bid to keep researchers working throughout the pandemic on all manner of projects that the government hopes will eventually help the economy rebound.READ MORE:Most B.C. adults could get their first COVID vaccine shot by July: health officialsThe Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

76,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/planning-for-dropouts-drugmakers-grapple-with-testing-unproven-vaccines-on-seniors/,"Feb 7, 2021",‘Planning for dropouts’: Drugmakers grapple with testing unproven vaccines on seniors,"At age 70, retired nurse Donna Lessard can expect to be towards the front of the line for a COVID-19 vaccine when supply and distribution expands in coming months.But instead, she’s opted for an unproven vaccine candidate she can have now – a two-dose product by the Quebec City-based biopharmaceuticalMedicago currently running Phase 2 clinical trials.Because the trials are blinded, the Montrealer doesn’t know if last month she received a second dose of the prospective vaccine or a placebo, and may not know for a year – well after most Canadians are expected to receive one of several licensed vaccines.Lessard admits her decision could put her at risk of COVID-19 infection much longer than other seniors, but says there are many people who need approved vaccines more urgently than she does.“I’m not in a nursing home, I’m in excellent health,” says Lessard, who was a nurse for 50 years before retiring in 2020. “There are a lot of other people, rightly so, that would go before me.”Despite the willingness of senior trial participants like Lessard, whether and how to include seniors in COVID-19 vaccine trials poses thorny ethical questions now that effective vaccines are available and more are soon to come, says University of Toronto bioethicist Kerry Bowman.Seniors, by far, have been hardest hit by the novel coronavirus, with about 70 per cent of Canada’s COVID-19 deaths involving people aged 80 and older, and nearly 20 per cent between the ages of 70 and 80.The emergence of more infectious variants adds even more uncertainty to the pandemic, especially after one version was linked to a devastating outbreak that engulfed a Barrie, Ont., long-term care facility and killed dozens of residents.“I generally don’t think it’s justifiable right now having senior citizens in completely blinded trials,” says Bowman.“We can’t fully quantify risks, which I think is significant…. The variants are the wild card now. We don’t even know which way this is going and the whole situation could get a lot worse very quickly.”Still, there can be exceptions for healthy volunteers such as Lessard, especially if the trial is designed to minimize potential harms, Bowman allows.The Medicago trial limits its use of placebos as one way to do that – the company says that for every volunteer who gets a saline injection, five participants receive the proposed vaccine.That’s instead of splitting volunteers equally between the placebo and treatment groups, more typical in double-blinded trials trying to assess how effective a proposed drug really is.Given the risks posed by the ongoing pandemic, infectious disease physician Zain Chagla suggests it would more appropriate to compare vaccine hopefuls to already proven options, which in Canada are by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.It’s hard for researchers to say they’re not causing harm if they effectively deny someone a proven drug, says Chagla, an associate professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton.“Many of these trials will have to eventually have some implementation of a standard-of-care drug, which might be Pfizer,” Chagla says of placebo arms.“And then at the end, make sure that everyone who got the (tested) drug also gets Pfizer,” says Chagla, adding the caveat that there are still uncertainties about what happens when someone takes two different COVID-19 vaccines.All clinical trials undergo multiple ethics and protocol reviews by the drug developer and Health Canada to ensure patient safety remains paramount, says Karri Venn, president of research at LMC Manna Research, which is running multiple trials for various biotechs, including Medicago’s vaccine trial.And trials don’t typically start with seniors or other vulnerable groups. Only if Phase 1 establishes safety among healthy adults would studies expand to older volunteers, with later trials adding in adolescents, children and pregnant women.Venn says COVID-19 has added novel complications to scientific research, and suspects it could soon become difficult to recruit and keep seniors committed to clinical trials if they know an approved vaccine is imminent.“This is for the first time posing a lot of challenges for the traditional way in how you would do research, to be honest with you,” says Venn, expecting some volunteers sign up planning to quit as soon as they’re eligible for other, approved options.“They may say, ‘I’m going to take (this proposed vaccine) and in nine months I’m going to say, “You know what? Unblind me.”’ … There’s all of that happening, too. It’s a very unusual time.”It’s very rare to unblind a participant partway through a trial, Venn adds, and if it does happen, it’s almost always for a medical or safety reason.But all trials must release any participant who wants to quit, no matter the reason, she says, and their data wouldn’t be included in the final results.Giving seniors a placebo is out of the question for Providence Therapeutics CEO Brad Sorenson, who is planning Phase 2 trials for his COVID-19 vaccine hopeful.The head of the Calgary-based biotech says his recently launched Phase 1 safety trials include a placebo group, but no seniors. Phase 2 will likely include seniors but no placebos.“We don’t want to include a placebo group for people that are older and at a higher risk. Not when there’s a vaccine that would be available to them,” says Sorenson, musing on a possible workaround.“We can do a comparative study where they get either our vaccine or a Moderna vaccine.”Assuming the trial can get its hands on these approved vaccines – allotments from Moderna and Pfizer are both facing significant distribution delays in Canada.Bowman sympathizes with volunteers who consider unknown protections of a trial vaccine to be better than nothing. He suggests those who consent to the terms of clinical trials do so “under duress.”“Before Christmas, we were told we’d be swimming in vaccines by now, and we’re really, really not,” says Bowman.“People have to protect their own lives and well-being.”READ MORE:Trudeau says government foresaw short-term delays in vaccine deliveries to Canada, planned accordinglyStill, concrete data on how seniors respond to prospective COVID-19 vaccines is crucial, especially with relatively few therapies and so much still uncertain about the disease, says Medicago’s senior director of scientific and medical affairs.“I know it’s a big request, but it’s part of science and that’s how it works and that’s how we make sure the product is good, that the people receiving it are safe,” says Nathalie Charland.“There are constraints related to the trial, we are aware of that, and that’s why we say a big thank you to all those who are involved in our trials.”Charland says Medicago’s Phase 2 trial has already collected the data it needs from hundreds of senior volunteers in Canada and the United States, but recruiting the thousands more needed in Phase 3 will be tougher.Half of the 30,000 participants needed are seniors, and half of all volunteers would get a placebo, she says.“We are already planning for dropouts. We are very conscious that this might – and probably will – happen but Phase 3 is an efficacy trial so we have to go in regions of the world where the virus is circulating a lot,” she says, noting prospective sites include Latin America and Europe.“It will be in countries where there’s not that many vaccines distributed yet. So that should help recruit subjects.”Lessard suspects she got Medicago’s vaccine candidate, citing a slight headache and sore arm after the first dose and another sore arm after the second dose.But she says that was not her primary reason for joining the trial, expressing hope her involvement will serve a greater public good.“There’s a lot of fear around the COVID vaccines and we still hear people saying, ‘Oh, I’m not going to take the vaccine until it’s perfect,’” says Lessard.“And my attitude is: Well, how are we going to get it perfect if nobody volunteers? And if not now, when? It’s got to be done now.”Cassandra Szklarski, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

She remembers thinking it was “a little exciting and a little nerve-wracking” because she wasn’t sure if it would hurt or what the side effects might be.The injection wasn’t bad. It was just a quick prick, she said, using her hands to demonstrate the motion.“We have collectively worried about these elders for a year now – and it was wonderful to see one more barrier put between them and the virus,” wrote Karen Johnson-Lefsrud, executive director of the Luther Court Society, in a newsletter shared with residents’ families.She included a photo of Sheldan getting her vaccine and noted that when staff asked if they could include her age, she told them it was fine because she is “way beyond being worried about age.”Sheldan says the secret to a life as long as hers is not thinking about it “because if you don’t think about it, it’s there just the same.” She’s often surprised when someone reminds her of how old she is. Despite being admittedly in denial, she’s “a bit proud” to have reached such an impressive birthday.READ ALSO:Neighbours help Sidney woman mark 103rd birthday with surprise paradeSheldan wasn’t sure how she would be celebrating this year because of the pandemic restrictions, but she was hoping for a little party and a chance to dress up.After more than a century, Sheldan thought she’d seen it all but COVID-19 is “all on its own [and] absolutely different” from everything she’s experienced.She has two children and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren – most of whom she hasn’t been able to see over the past year. However, over the summer, one of her grandchildren got married and came by the care home to have her first dance so Sheldan could watch.Johnson-Lefsrud emphasized that the Luther Court Society is grateful to the nurses and to their own staff who worked hard to plan the vaccination day.

Older people with dementia in long-term care are not prisoners,” she added. “The good news is there are some things we can do to help support infection prevention and control while at the same time not isolating seniors exclusively in their rooms.”The novel coronavirus has taken a lethal toll on Canadians living in long-term care homes. More than 3,000 of Ontario’s over 5,000 deaths have been in these facilities, as have more than 600 of British Columbia’s roughly 1,000 fatalities. Overall in Canada, residents of these homes account for 10 per cent of total cases and 72 per cent of deaths.A woman whose grandmother died of COVID-19 in a Vancouver care home has raised the alarm about residents wandering during outbreaks. Parbs Bains said she was on a Zoom call with her sick grandmother when another resident entered the room and began hugging her and kissing her on the forehead, remaining for several minutes before a nurse arrived to usher her out.The care home, Little Mountain Place, is the site of B.C.’s deadliest outbreak in such a facility, with 41 dead. But in all long-term care homes with outbreaks in the Vancouver Coastal Health region, keeping residents with cognitive impairments isolated has been a challenge, said chief medical health officer Dr. Patricia Daly.The health authority advises staff to monitor residents who wander but not to lock them in rooms or restrain them, Daly said.Tamblyn Watts said 80 per cent of residents of long-term care homes in the country have some form of cognitive impairment such as dementia. Keeping them in one room without social engagement, exercise or daily routines has a negative effect, she said.She said more staff, not necessarily with medical training but with dementia training, are needed to compassionately intervene when they see a resident wandering and redirect them to a safe area. Ideally, there would be a separate room where residents could walk to other than their own, Tamblyn Watts added.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });“It does, however, mean that you need to have people on deck to be able to help with that,” she said.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Quebec announced last year it would hire 10,000 patient attendants to work in care homes and train them over last summer. B.C. and Ontario have also created new jobs in care homes for people without prior experience, but much more hiring needs to be done, Tamblyn Watts said.She also said more infection control, cleaning, testing and now vaccines are needed, in order to prevent COVID-19 from getting inside care homes to begin with.Dr. Roger Wong, clinical professor and vice dean in the University of British Columbia faculty of medicine, said people with dementia need a lot of hands-on care.“Clearly, we always need more staffing,” he said.But he said there are some ways to help residents with cognitive impairments stay in their rooms, including placing a stop sign by the door or hanging a curtain over the doorway. In some secure units, seniors wear wristbands that ring an alarm when they leave, Wong said.It’s also technologically possible, though not common practice, to place GPS trackers in residents’ footwear, he said. Playing a familiar piece of music in their rooms can be comforting and help them remain in that space, Wong added.He said families could plan to speak to their loved ones virtually at times when they are more likely to get confused and wander, often in the late afternoon or evening for Alzheimer’s patients. However, it can be a challenge to ensure that residents understand the people on their screen are their loved ones, he said.Jennifer Stewart, manager of advocacy and education for the Alzheimer Society of B.C., acknowledged that virtual visits can be helpful for some and confusing for others.Patients may not be able to understand or retain the information about why they need to be separated from others or be able to follow protocols, such as frequent hand washing, she added.“I think we’re in a really tough spot,” she said. “I don’t think anyone’s found a perfect solution here.”However, Stewart said person-centred care is key: looking at each patient as a unique individual and speaking with their families about how to provide them with safety, comfort and meaning.B.C. seniors advocate Isobel Mackenzie said the primary way that the virus is spreading in care homes is from staff to residents, rather than from resident to resident. Staff are in close physical contact with many different patients, she noted, and many residents are not mobile.She said, though, that immediately after a single positive case, all residents and employees should be tested and residents should be isolated. Every patient positive for COVID-19 should be kept not only in their room, but as much as possible in a certain section of the home, she said.Daly of Vancouver Coastal Health said care homes in the region do not automatically do mass testing after a single staff member tests positive. She said testing depends on the likelihood the employee transmitted the virus to others in the home as well as the timing of transmission.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Mackenzie has also called for frequent, routine testing of staff, which B.C. does not do. Ontario tests staff at least every two weeks and has also deployed some pilot projects for rapid testing.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-6');gptRefreshSlots.push(6); });Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said B.C. considered whether to periodically send staff to a testing site, as is done in Ontario, but that is very “low yield” and challenging to do. As for rapid testing at care homes on a daily basis, that is “not feasible” with the tests that the province has, she said.“Our focus has been instead on making sure we have the resources to ensure staffing, particularly if an outbreak has been identified. When an outbreak is identified, testing is done,” Henry said.The seniors advocate said understaffing is “absolutely” still an issue.“I think there have been additional strains on an already strained staffing system,” Mackenzie said.She said family members can be designated essential visitors to be the eyes and ears of a loved one within the care home and flag problems for staff. Some residents don’t have family members who are able to play this role but many do, she said.Mackenzie added that even when dementia patients are isolated, they should be receiving physical touch from staff. Care providers should also use gentle persuasion and de-escalation techniques to assuage any anxieties residents are experiencing, she said.“If they’re mobile enough that they’re individually ambulating out of their room in the common areas, they’ve got some capacity. That is not a person in end-stage Alzheimer’s with no capacity to understand anything,” she pointed out.“It’s easy to throw up our hands and say we couldn’t do anything, we can’t isolate these people because they wander. That is not true of every resident or even of most residents. It might be true of some and we know how to manage that.”Laura Dhillon Kane, The Canadian PressCoronavirusSeniors"

A Vancouver Coastal Health medical health officer determined there was “minimal exposure risk” and was not declaring an outbreak, it said.Instead, the health authority placed the home on “enhanced surveillance,” including heightened monitoring of residents, hypervigilance in screening visitors and stronger infection control practices. Visitors were still welcome and group activities were continuing, the email said.Bains felt certain that this was the beginning of the end for her 89-year-old grandmother.“I was like, ‘This is it.’ I was bawling because I just knew this was going to be it,” Bains recalled.The facility declared an outbreak two days later.It has become the deadliest care home outbreak in British Columbia. Ninety-nine out of 114 residents have been infected and 41 of those have died, including Bains’s grandmother. Seventy staff members also tested positive, but most have recovered.Two families are questioning whether some deaths could have been avoided if the home had taken stronger measures immediately after the first case was identified. They also say that a hard-working but understaffed nursing team struggled to keep residents isolated and care for those who were sick as the virus spread through the facility.During a Zoom call with her grandmother after she contracted COVID-19, Bains said another female resident entered the room and began hugging and kissing the elderly woman on the forehead. After several minutes, a nurse rushed in and ushered the other resident out, she recalled.Bains said that while she didn’t know if the other woman had the virus, it alarmed her that residents were able to wander between rooms without staff immediately noticing.On other occasions, Bains said her grandmother’s oxygen tubes were out of her nose and she would desperately yell for help over the Zoom call. Nurses told her that her grandmother was actually one of the fortunate ones because her room was close to their station, Bains said.Bains said she is “so angry” at the way the outbreak was handled.“Something had to have gone wrong at Little Mountain Place … for this to be so lethal,” she said.Little Mountain Place referred questions to Vancouver Coastal Health, where Chief Medical Health Officer Dr. Patricia Daly said the provincewide standard is that outbreaks are not automatically declared when one staff member tests positive.The health authority determines whether the employee was in the care home during their infectious period and whether they potentially exposed other staff or residents, for example by not properly using personal protective equipment, she said.If there is no evidence of exposures, the authority places the home on “enhanced surveillance” and monitors for other cases, she said. Some testing may be done, and group activities continue but must always follow a COVID-19 safety plan, she said.Declaring an outbreak every time a single staff member tests positive would be too hard on residents who suffer when they are isolated and their visitors are restricted, Daly said.“We’re trying to find that right balance.”Vancouver Coastal Health said there was no mass testing of all residents and staff after the first case was identified. It was only on Nov. 22, after a resident tested positive and the outbreak was declared, that full-facility testing was done, it said.Daly said broad testing is not always necessary because it depends on the risk and timing of potential exposures.At Little Mountain Place, it became clear transmission occurred before the initial case was identified, she said.She said during an outbreak, residents are supposed to stay in their rooms, but it is very challenging for patients with dementia to follow those rules. Staff are advised to monitor residents who wander but not to lock anyone in or restrain them,googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });she said.“Keeping residents with cognitive impairment in their rooms, that has been a common challenge across all facilities in all of our outbreaks,” Daly said.Bains and another relative, Bernadette Cheung, have demanded an investigation of the care home’s response to the virus.Daly said she received a letter from a family member last week and has ordered Vancouver Coastal Health’s licensing team to conduct a review once the outbreak is over.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });The team will examine whether the home is following regulations under the Community Care and Assisted Living Act and, if not, will require it to develop a plan to address those gaps. In very rare cases, reviews by the team have led to a change in management, Daly said.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said she wants to see routine testing of all staff members at care homes. At Little Mountain Place, all staff and residents should have been tested immediately after the first employee tested positive, she said.Screening for symptoms is inadequate because people can be asymptomatic and contagious, she noted.“The fact that more people were infected two days later, if you had tested everybody before then, you’d have caught some people,” she said. “You would have been able to isolate them if they were residents or you would have been able to pull them from the roster if they were staff.”Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial public health officer, said Monday the province is “looking at” regular rapid testing of staff in care homes. Ontario started doing rapid testing at long-term care facilities in November.Cheung, whose grandmother died of COVID-19 at Little Mountain Place and has been outspoken about her concerns, said Health Minister Adrian Dix called her on Monday. She said he promised an “intense review” of the outbreak and to follow up again with her about his conversations with the care home and the health authority.The ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Though the conversation was light on details, Cheung said she appreciated his empathy.“That gives us hope, at least, that it is a priority for him.”She said she has also received confirmation from Vancouver Coastal Health that her formal complaint against the care home will proceed.Cheung has criticized the care home for not being transparent with families. She wants to know more about why the health authority determined there was “minimal risk” of exposure from the first infected staff member and declined to declare an outbreak on Nov. 20, she said.“Essentially, we’re being kept in the dark and it raises concerns and even suspicions,” she said.ALSO READ:Canada secures 20M more Pfizer vaccine doses; U.S. border closure extended to Feb. 21Laura Dhillon Kane, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

83,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/life/aging-gracefully/,"Jan 1, 2021",Aging Gracefully,"– Words by Kaisha Scofield Photography by Lia CroweWe all know that one of the only certainties in life is that we will get older. Yet, in our society, aging is rarely discussed or prepared for. In fact, a common statement on aging is that it takes most by surprise. Many people feel young but look in the mirror only to see an old person reflected back at them. How did this happen? We are a society obsessed with youth and productivity, and slowing down seems like a luxury we cannot afford. So it is not surprising that the topic of aging is avoided, often until it is too late.The truth is, aging is an inevitable part of living. By accepting the aging process, we are better able to be proactive in how to prepare our body and mind for this very natural transition. By identifying the areas that are most commonly frustrating for more senior populations, we can engage in targeted selfcare to make aging less overwhelming.The most common complaints about aging are health issues associated with degeneration. Loss of muscle and bone health, poor joint health, digestive issues, nutritional deficiencies, hormone imbalance, loss of energy and impaired cognitive abilities are all common health problems the more senior populations deal with. The good news is, with a few simple lifestyle and wellness practices, many of these health issues can be minimized or avoided all together.Use it or lose it. Inactivity is the fastest way to age the body. Too many of us exist in a sedentary state; sitting at a desk for eight hours of the day, driving to and from work and then spending our evenings on the couch. Making solid lifestyle choices that include physical activity is the most effective way to keep the body and mind healthy, long-term. While this isn’t necessarily news to anyone, daily movement is becoming increasingly urgent as kids, teens and adults are spending more time on devices and games and in front of screens and, as a result, physical literacy is failing.Once movement habits are improved, it is important to keep the body happy and well maintained. We all know the feeling of sore and creaking joints. That crackling sound is called crepitus, which seems like a very unsettling yet appropriate name. These creaks, while harmless, are generally a result of degeneration in the bones and connective tissue. This tissue is made up of collagen, the same collagen that your aesthetician tells you to take for glowing skin. Collagen is found in skin, ligaments, cartilage, tendons and bone. The bad news is that it deteriorates as we age. The great news is that it can be replenished. Collagen can be taken orally via supplements, pill or powder or by drinking bone broth. This is is a widely recommended support for joint health and for healthy skin, nails and hair.Aging well depends largely on fuelling the body with a nutrient-dense diet. Vitamin and mineral depletion is a common issue for the aging body because as we get older, the body’s ability to absorb and distribute nutrients can lessen. We typically absorb vitamins and minerals from the food we eat, via the digestive process, but digestive health can decline as we age, through deterioration, poor dietary habits, tissue damage, etc. Natural hormone transitions also occur, which can cause the body to go through fluctuations in appetite and energy levels, making meal preparation frustrating and unenjoyable. It’s a difficult combination of issues that are often ignored.The malabsorption of nutrients can occur for several reasons but the two main causes are a lack of dietary healthy fats and consistent dehydration. Our unfortunate vilification of fat has led to a largely depleted population. Many vitamins and minerals, essential to our body, are fat soluble, meaning that without a proper intake of healthy dietary fats, we are unable to absorb nutrients in our food. Not to mention the essential fatty acids themselves playing a crucial role in cellular, tissue and nerve health, to name a few.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Alongside healthy fat intake, hydration plays a vital role in absorbing the other vitamins and minerals that are water soluble. One of the easiest ways to increase your energy levels, mood, sleep and digestion is to improve your hydration. More than 50 per cent of the population is consistently dehydrated. Mild dehydration can cause fatigue, nausea, headaches, moodiness, cramping and constipation. Electrolytes in the form of sugar-free powders, tablets or even a small pinch of salt can vastly improve hydration levels in the body.Fluctuating hormones are confusing at the best of times, but in an aging body, they can be especially disruptive. The hormone testosterone, for example, depletes as we age, an issue that can affect both men and women. Occasionally men can experience an age-related, steep decline in testosterone that can lead to many health issues. Often referred to as “male menopause,” symptoms are similar to those experienced in female menopause, such as hot flashes, breast tenderness, mood fluctuations and erectile disfunction. It is just as important for men to monitor hormone health as it is for women.For women, the most obvious hormonal transition is the big M, menopause. There is no way to avoid menopause, but there are steps we can take to prepare for it. Maintaining an active lifestyle is essential. Equally important is fuelling the body with a diet that is focused on nutrient-dense whole foods, including healthy fats and proper hydration. Menopause is never fully predictable but well-balanced and supported hormones will ensure that the process runs as smoothly as possible, perhaps avoiding having to put ice down your shirt to cool a hot flash.Reducing sugar intake is the most important dietary change needed to support hormonal balance and the whole body, at any age. Sugar depletes nutrients and disrupts hormone regulation. Insulin, testosterone and estrogen are affected when sugar intake is elevated. These imbalances can lead to insulin resistance which, among other things, can cause heart disease, some cancers and diabetes. Insulin resistance wreaks havoc on hormonal functions, disrupting digestion, weight, sleep, mood and stress tolerance.There are many unknowns in the aging process and while feelings of uncertainty and apprehension are understandable, avoidance will create a missed opportunity. It is never too early or too late to start preparing your body for the next phase of life, and by incorporating a few preventative measures, you are more likely to create a solid foundation of health and wellness to launch from.The more we learn about aging, the less it is about the end of life and more about the culmination of living. There may be a sense of dread as we creep toward each milestone, but what often follows is a growing sense of relief and freedom. Removing the fear and ignorance surrounding the aging process helps us understand how to support our body as we go through these changes. By paying attention to movement, nutrient density and hormone balance, we can not only ensure that we age on our own terms, but that we do so gracefully.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });Story courtesy ofBoulevard Magazine, a Black Press Media publicationLike Boulevard Magazine onFacebookand follow them onInstagram"
84,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/visit-restrictions-contributed-to-depression-among-care-home-residents-doctor/,"Dec 28, 2020",Visit restrictions contributed to depression among care home residents: doctor,"A plastic barrier sits on a table between Debbie Drew and her father during their visits in the reception area of a long-term care home where the first Canadian died of COVID-19.Nine months later, Drew said visiting restrictions that were initially needed at facilities like the Lynn Valley Care Centre are now causing more harm than good for her dad and other residents who are mostly confined to their rooms.That’s where she fears 96-year-old Graham Drew will die alone.“It’s very hard because he’s getting depressed. He’s sad. He needs the socialization because he’s been a very social person all his life,” Drew said of the man known for his sense of humour and love of singing songs like “Take Me Out to the Ball Game.”The National Institute on Ageing said families in British Columbia are enduring the most restrictive visitation policies compared with long-term care homes anywhere else in the country. The institute has issued guidelines to support the reopening of care homes to family caregivers and visitors, even during outbreaks.Drew said she and her sister and brother regularly visited their father since he moved to the care home three years ago. They decided she would be the so-called designated visitor allowed to enter a common area once a week for 30 minutes though the Plexiglas barrier separating her from her father makes visits challenging because of his hearing loss.Isobel Mackenzie, the advocate for seniors in British Columbia, said the unintended consequences of tightened visiting policies have contributed to a spike in loneliness and depression for residents, as revealed in a survey by her office. About 15,000 residents, families and members of the public participated in the survey this summer.The findings released last month show a seven per cent rate of increase in antipsychotic use, and a three per cent jump in antidepressant use between March and September for residents who have struggled to cope without adequate contact with their family caregivers.“What they talked about is: ‘I need more help. I want somebody to help me to the toilet. I want somebody to help me eat. I want somebody who’s going to sit and listen to me,’” Mackenzie said.The lack of an association that represents residents and their families at the 300 care homes in B.C. means they don’t have a voice in policy discussions between the government, care-home operators and unions for staff, she said.Mackenzie has called on the B.C. government to establish a family council association, similar to one in Ontario, that would be included in future consultations on issues affecting residents of long-term care and assisted living facilities.The Health Ministry did not respond directly to an inquiry about whether it would consider the creation of such an association, saying only that it recognizes the important role of family councils that exist at licensed facilities.Not all care homes have councils, and those that do aren’t part of any collective group.Mackenzie said care home operators are arbitrarily deciding who qualifies as an essential or designated visitor, with many facilities allowing only one or the other among regular family caregivers.Dr. Bonnie Henry, the provincial health officer for B.C., said she understands the ongoing challenges families are facing when trying to visit their loved ones during a pandemic that has caused a disproportionate number of deaths among long-term care residents.“We’ve been quite clear on what an essential visitor is and recognize the importance of essential visitors and have been working to ensure that the guidance is applied appropriately and consistently,” she said.Families have the right to appeal any decision to the manager of a facility and to the BC Patient Safety and Quality Council, Henry said.Mackenzie said about 80 per cent of residents had no visits between March and June as care-home operators decided whether they met the criteria for an essential visit.“Certainly, as we got into the summer months, we had far more restrictions in B.C. than any of the other provinces.”At the very least, care homes should permit one visitor to see residents in their room, something that is not happening at most facilities, Mackenzie said.“I’ve run a care home. I can’t imagine the nightmare of having to co-ordinate visits in a common area,” she said.READ MORE:Virtual concert series Songs for Seniors to bring families separated by COVID togetherDr. Samir Sinha, director of geriatrics at Sinai Health System and the University Health Network in Toronto, said the impact of visitor restrictions on long-term care residents whose family caregivers are a big part of their lives has been lost amid the focus on daily COVID-19 case counts.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });“How many families are we putting in extreme distress and turmoil?

85,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/life/sales-surge-for-arbutus-rv/,"Dec 25, 2020",Sales surge for Arbutus RV,"– Words by Sandra Jones Photography by Lia CroweTo say that the pandemic has been and issue for business is like saying the iceberg was a challenge for the Titanic. There is no question that the economic fallout from COVID-19 has been grim. But amid the coronavirus chaos, some businesses have not only thrived but seen a surge in sales in response to changes in consumer behaviour.For Craig and Rose Little, owners of Arbutus RV, this has been an unprecedented year.“We were enjoying record months in the early part of 2020 and that came crashing to an abrupt halt for about six weeks,” says Craig. “It didn’t stop altogether, but sales dropped by 50 per cent.After that, sales went straight up.”Fortunately, as the largest full-service recreational vehicle dealer network in the province, Arbutus RV was ready to handle the increased volume.“We always like to carry lots of inventory and we were fortunate to have 840 units on hand when the pandemic hit.”Their large inventory has sustained the company as consumers—reluctant to fly, yet still eager to travel—regarded RVs as the ideal self-contained and safe solution. With units running the gamut from high-end luxury coaches to compact trailers, there are options for every lifestyle and every budget.Rose says they’ve seen a lot of changes to RV amenities over the years.“They can be a true home on wheels with residential-sized fridges, outdoor kitchens, TVs, home stereo systems with surround sound and fireplaces. We get a lot of feedback from customers who tell us the RVs are nicer than their permanent home.”One popular option has been the travel trailer.“The 17- to 30-foot travel trailer is especially appealing to the first-time buyer,” notes Craig.“Most people already have a suitable tow vehicle, for at least the smaller units, so you just need to have a hitch and away you go.”And, while those in the boomer generation have long been fans of the RV experience, now millennials are rolling into the market too.“Even before COVID-19, we were seeing a huge interest from young adults who had enjoyed camping as kids with their boomer parents. Now they want to make those same great memories with their own kids.”Whether motivated by the pandemic, nostalgia or a love of the great outdoors, customers have been turning to Arbutus RV for more than 32 years. Craig, who opened his first store in Mill Bay after identifying a gap in the marketplace, has exponentially grown the business, adding six additional sales and service stores, stretching from Sidney to Courtenay.“It’s been pretty organic growth,” says Craig. “After Mill Bay opened, we got a call from an operation in Nanaimo. They had been selling mostly park models and horse trailers and having a hard time making a success of it.We ended up taking over that location and shortly afterwards got approached to buy another dealership in Sidney. So suddenly we ended up with three locations, which wasn’t necessarily a well-thought-out plan.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });But the couple saw the demand was there and went to work to begin building up the infrastructure, systems and team to support the growth.“With a marketing background, I spearheaded the marketing,” says Rose, “while Craig was in charge of ordering the product and managing the day-to-day business.”googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });As Craig recalls, the early years of growing the company weren’t always easy:“We worked long hours and I remember doing payroll at one location and staying up all night to get payroll done for the next location. It was challenging but fun.”Now all-nighters are a thing of the past but the expansion of this going-places company didn’t slow down for long.“There was a bit of a lull in our growth as we made sure the three locations were up and running smoothly,” says Craig. “But then opportunity knocked again.”Rose remembers flying home from Alberta after assessing and ultimately walking away from a business opportunity that didn’t seem like a great fit.“I told Craig that I’d rather open up another dealership on the island instead.”So, when they landed in Comox, Craig had a suggestion.“He said he’d had his eye on some property in Courtenay years ago and that we should drive by and take a look. Turns out that property wasn’t for sale but the one directly across the street was. If that’s not a sign, I don’t know what is,” laughs Rose.Two weeks later, they bought the property and as luck would have it, they ultimately bought the original property that Craig had spotted years ago as a way to expand their lot.The company has since added two more locations—one in Port Alberni and the most recent acquisition this past September in Parksville.“We want to make sure that our customers can buy their RV in their own community and get it serviced close to home as well,” says Craig.Their team has also expanded to keep pace and now includes 150 staff.“We’ve built an awesome team,” Rose says. “Many of them have been with us for decades.”Employees aren’t the only ones who are a committed part of the Arbutus RV operation.“We were at our Parksville location and one of our customers told me they were delighted to see us at the new location as they had purchased five RVs from us over the years,” says Rose. “It’s also not uncommon to meet people who are the second and even third generations of a family who keep coming back. We love that!”On an island that is seeing significant population growth, the Littles see a clear road ahead.“We’re so blessed to have this natural setting and so many opportunities for adventure in the most marvellous climate in Canada. Even though some people started RVing this year because of the pandemic, I’m pretty sure they’ll get hooked on the lifestyle.”Story courtesy ofBoulevard Magazine, a Black Press Media publicationLike Boulevard Magazine onFacebookand follow them onInstagram"

She said that when she thought about the many seniors in the area living in care homes, she imagined what they go through every Christmas.She wanted to do something.RELATED: B.C. seniors worry more about death from loneliness than COVID-19RELATED: Connect with your elderly neighbours during COVID-19 crisis“My heart really went out to them. I guess it’s a lonely season for the elderly every year and this year even more so with the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Conway. “So I was thinking of a way that we could encourage them and I came up with this idea of writing letters.”Conway, with the help of her husband Chris Conway and friend Elizabeth Doell, began writing letters by hand in October. It took them nearly three months to write 330 letters, which have now been distributed to senior residents at Stanford Village, Arrowsmith Lodge, Cokely Manor and Little Mountain Manor.“They’re little Christmas cards and they have a little Christmas message and encouragement including well wishes for the coming year,” said Conway. “We want them to know that they’re loved and remembered this Christmas.”Conway said they purchased the Christmas cards themselves but would have created them if more people were involved. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, they weren’t able to get more friends to come out and join them.“It took too much time writing them that we just didn’t have enough time to make the Christmas cards,” said Conway. “We’ve written quite a lot. We didn’t use a computer. We wanted them all hand-written because we wanted to have a personal touch. We’ve got a list of names and they’re personally addressed.”Conway hopes to do it again next year and would like to personally hand them out to recipients.“It has been a lot of fun and we’ve had a lot of support even before we began handing them out,” said Conway. “We definitely want to do this again and involve more people. I would like this to become a family tradition.

88,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/no-funds-for-provinces-that-dont-agree-to-improve-long-term-care-standards-pm-hints/,"Dec 17, 2020","No funds for provinces that don’t agree to improve long-term care standards, PM hints","Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is hinting that provinces that don’t want to work with Ottawa to improve standards in long-term care homes won’t get federal funding.In a year-end interview Wednesday with The Canadian Press, Trudeau said his government will “happily partner” with provinces and territories that want to boost standards in long-term care facilities.And he said Ottawa will help them cover the costs of those improvements.But he warned that provinces that don’t choose to take the federal government up on that offer will have some explaining to do to their own populations.“The provinces that don’t choose to give their seniors the highest level of standards will be asked questions on that by the folks who are sending their moms and dads into those senior centres,” Trudeau said.“And it will become a difficult answer for them to give.”The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed deplorable conditions in some long-term care homes, particularly in Ontario and Quebec. Reports on conditions in the worst-hit homes have revealed appalling examples of neglect, abuse and unsanitary conditions.Residents of long-term care facilities account for more than than 80 per cent of the COVID-19 deaths in Canada.Delivery of health care is a provincial area of responsibility and some premiers, particularly Quebec’s Francois Legault, have strenuously objected to idea of the federal government setting national standards for long-term care facilities or setting any conditions on funding provided for health care.The premiers have unanimously demanded that Ottawa immediately increase its annual, unconditional health transfers to provinces and territories by at least $28 billion a year, money that is sent with no strings attached.“I don’t see what the federal government knows about nursing homes,” Legault said last week after Trudeau failed to acquiesce to the premiers’ demand during a daylong, first ministers’ video conference.“If he wants to help with nursing homes and hospitals, he has to boost recurring funding.”Legault’s views have been echoed by other premiers, including Ontario’s Doug Ford and Saskatchewan’s Scott Moe. But premiers in the Atlantic provinces been more open to the idea of federal funding specifically tied to improving conditions in long-term care homes.In the interview Wednesday, Trudeau appeared to signal that his government will negotiate separately with each province and territory that is willing to accept additional, targeted funding for long-term care — much as it did to target funding for mental health and home care a few years ago.“The approach we have as a federal government is to first start looking at what the best practices are in certain jurisdictions that do have stronger standards than others,” he said.“And work with the jurisdictions who want to, to increase their standards to the best possible level. And the federal government to be there to help them with the extra costs involved in getting up to that level … So we will happily partner and work with the provinces as we have during this pandemic.”Trudeau acknowledged that long-term care is a provincial jurisdiction. But he said: “The dignity of elders, the safety of seniors, doesn’t really have much of a jurisdiction. Not when you talk about their lives.”He noted that the federal government sent the military and Canadian Red Cross to help in overwhelmed long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec last spring, at the request of those provinces.“I guess, theoretically we could have said, ‘No, it’s your area, you deal with it.’ No. The federal government is going to be there to look out for every single Canadian and that means, yes, working with the premiers.”Trudeau said standards in long-term care vary across the country and from facility to facility within provinces.“And I don’t think that’s right. I think every senior in this country, regardless of where they live, should feel confident that if they go into the long-term care centre that they get accepted in, down the street or across the road or on the other side of town, they don’t have to worry that ‘Oh, maybe that’s one of the bad ones’ or ‘Maybe I’m lucky enough to have gotten into one of the good ones,”’ he said.“There needs to be a sense that in this country we ensure that every single senior gets to age in dignity and in safety and we’re not there.”Joan Bryden, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism?

89,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/business/islander-with-mobility-issues-lobbies-for-more-electric-carts-at-superstore/,"Dec 13, 2020",Islander with mobility issues lobbies for more electric carts at Superstore,"When Crofton resident Stephen Lyons enters the Real Canadian Superstore in Duncan, it’s like Norm coming into the bar on Cheers. Everybody knows his name.Lyons, who has mobility issues, goes there almost every day and absolutely loves the place and the staff. It’s a social outing for him.“It’s a good place for older people to come,” he said. “The people in that shop, they work hard and look after their customers. These people are great ambassadors for the store.“The people that work there are so nice, so kind. I know about 50 per cent of them by name.”Lyons’ only beef is the lack of available electric carts for those who are disabled to use to get around the store. There are only three of them and they’re either in poor working order or not working at all.When he went in one day, none of the carts were operating and staff indicated it’s difficult, if not impossible, to get replacement parts for them.Lyons thinks Loblaws, the ownership company, should be maintaining the carts and have more of them in the store in keeping with the demand from an ever-increasing seniors’ population here.“They’re all broken, they’re not fit for use,” he said. “I go in every day – like a treat for me, like going into a club.”Store management, Lyons added, would like to have six carts.“I’ve talked to other people, they’re not very impressed,” he indicated. “I’ve spoken to them and they’re not very happy.”But Lyons figures the hands of local store employees are tied and they can’t do much about the situation.“They haven’t got the authority to do anything,” Lyons conceded. “They would love to say I would do anything to help you. They can’t.”The Courier did not receive a reply to either an email inquiry nor a phone call to Loblaws public relations in Ontario.However, Joe Sjodin, an assistant manager at the Duncan Real Canadian Superstore, conceded the pandemic creates challenges for getting parts to fix broken-down carts.“Possibly we can request for more,” he said. “I don’t usually get much feedback.“We look at how often they’re being used and how often they’re breaking down. I know we do have our aging population and they are used a lot more.”Lyons was grateful to the Courier for looking into the matter and then sent an email himself. “I got so fed up,” he said.Lyons did get a response from Precious (no last name given) in Superstore Customer Care.“Your feedback is very valuable to us, as it is one of the best ways for us to improve and it’s very important to our continued success,” the message read in part.“We thank you for bringing this matter to our attention. Accordingly, I have taken this opportunity to share your feedback with our store management team and they will be taking the necessary steps to address this appropriately.”It may have been a coincidence, but the situation was much better on Friday, Dec. 4 when Lyons went into the store.“The main thing is today for the first time ever I think they’ve finally gotten back and working,” he noted. “For the last week, they’ve only had one. The other day, I waited for an hour and a half.”Lyons hopes the parent company takes notice and realizes the need is there on a regular basis to keep the carts working.“It’s a good retirement area,” he stressed. “A lot of people move here from the Mainland or Alberta. The amount of disabled people or clinically old people is tremendous.”When a cart isn’t available for his use, Lyons said the staff will bend over backwards to get items for him. Sometimes he’ll only go for three items but it’s potentially a lot more if he could be mobile around the store on a cart.“That’s just the beginning,” he said. “I’ll go up and down the aisles and I’ll get more stuff.“On average, I spend at least between $75 and $100 every visit, every day. I could get loads of stuff.”Lyons even thought about getting his own personal electric cart to take to the store, but that wasn’t feasible.“You can’t attach it to the Rolls Royce,” he quipped. “My other car, I would put it on it and it would tip over.”disabilitiesSeniorsStephen Lyons hopes bringing up the issue of electric carts that seldom function at the Duncan Real Canadian Superstore will bring some action from parent company Loblaws.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Monday if the approval comes as expected, Canada will receive the first doses next week, and 249,000 doses by the end of the month.READ MORE:Canada to get 249,000 doses of Pfizer vaccine in December, Trudeau saysPfizer Canada spokeswoman Christina Antoniou told The Canadian Press that the company is asking for those doses at first to only be given at the first 14 delivery sites.She said where the vaccine can be injected is “part of ongoing discussions” with provincial governments, who are in charge of getting the vaccine into patients. However she noted Pfizer’s actual contract for the COVID-19 vaccine is with the federal government.“Pfizer, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the provinces are working together to finalize preparations at the first point of use sites this week, including training on how to handle the product,” she said. “These are the sites identified by the federal government’s National Operations Centre for initial vaccination of priority populations.”Tam said she is hopeful that as everyone involved gets more experienced and comfortable transporting and administering the vaccine, things could change.Pfizer’s vaccine is extremely delicate and must be stored at temperatures below -70 C, until shortly before it is administered. It can be stored in a refrigerator for up to five days, and at room temperature for up to two hours, before it is diluted and then injected.The ultralow temperature has made the entire delivery process much more complicated for Pfizer than what is being planned for other vaccines yet to come. While other vaccines will be sent by their manufacturers to one national site and then distributed within Canada, Pfizer is shipping its first vaccine doses to 14 sites designated by the provinces.There are two sites each in Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia and Alberta, and one in each of the other six provinces. Eventually the plan is to have 205 sites in the provinces.The Pfizer vaccine is also too touchy to be shipped north to remote Indigenous communities. That means two of the four priority groups identified for initial vaccines aren’t likely to get access to the first rounds of vaccinations.The National Advisory Committee on Immunization recommended last week that the first doses go to residents of long-term care and their caregivers, front-line health workers, people over the age of 80 and adults in Indigenous communities where an outbreak would be harder to manage.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });Most provinces are following those recommendations almost exactly.The United Kingdom began vaccinating people with the Pfizer shots Tuesday, after last week being the first country to approve the vaccine.Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Dominic LeBlanc said an expected executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump to prioritize Pfizer doses for Americans should not affect Canada’s expected deliveries.READ MORE:Trump, 0 for 2 on tapping Canada’s health resources, may try again with COVID vaccineLeBlanc says concerns about dose supplies were contemplated when the contracts were signed to ensure supplies could come from more than one location.Canada’s first doses of Pfizer’s vaccine are to come from lots produced at the company’s plant in Belgium.Tam says the exciting news about the vaccine is welcome but warns it will be a while before enough doses are injected to control the COVID-19 pandemic.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });She said there are now more than 71,000 active cases of COVID-19 nationally, and an average of 92 people are dying of the illness every day. Hospitals in many provinces are feeling the pandemic’s pressure, with more than 2,680 people being treated for COVID-19 in hospitals, almost one-fifth of those in critical care.Quebec Premier François Legault warned there may be more lockdown measures coming in that province as hospitalizations continued to rise, hitting 835 Tuesday, up by almost 100 patients compared to a week ago.Nunavut provided a bright spot of news in the pandemic fight Tuesday, with chief public health officer Dr. Michael Patterson noting a milestone had occurred in the territory’s recovery from its first outbreak.Last month Patterson warned the limited health capacity in Nunavut couldn’t handle much more as four communities struggled with cases. On Tuesday he said three of those four were back to zero cases. There was one new case in Arviat.Mia Rabson, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic? Make a donationhere."
91,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/doctors-concerned-about-rise-in-dangerous-medications-in-ltc-homes-during-pandemic/,"Dec 3, 2020",Doctors concerned about rise in dangerous medications in LTC homes during pandemic,"The first wave of COVID-19 triggered an increase in psychiatric drug prescriptions in long-term care homes, new data shows, and geriatrics experts warn this puts patients with dementia at risk for further harm from falls, stroke and sedation.Faced with staff shortages and lockdowns that restrict caregiver visits, nursing homes increasingly fall back on medications to regulate behaviour and manage mental health concerns, says Toronto geriatrician Dr. Nathan Stall.Prescriptions of antipsychotics, antidepressants, sleeping medications and benzodiazepines all increased between March and September, according to a study of Ontario’s 623 licensed nursing homes.This is an abrupt reversal after years of declining use of sedative medications in seniors, says Stall, who led the study.Overall, an “additional 1,000 residents are being prescribed antipsychotics who were not on the medication before the pandemic,” Stall says. The jump occurred following restrictions on visitors and congregate activities such as dining and recreational groups.Such “knee-jerk reactions to try and medicate the distress of residents in nursing homes” during the COVID-19 pandemic are a serious concern, Stall said.He warns that antipsychotics come with a “black-box warning” for the elderly. Stall says they increase the “risk of stroke, falls and all-cause mortality, and are not recommended for frail, older adults,” such as those with dementia, who make up about 70 per cent of nursing-home residents in Ontario.The preliminary figures from the Ontario study were released Monday on medRxiv (pronounced “med archive”), an online preprint server for medical research.The findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, are in line with growing evidence that during the global pandemic, rising numbers of nursing home residents have received sedative medications, such as antipsychotics.It could take weeks or months for the findings to be peer-reviewed, but Stall believes it is important to get this information out now in the midst of a second wave.According to a November report in the medical journal The Lancet, a greater proportion of people with dementia in the United Kingdom have been prescribed antipsychotic medication during the pandemic than in previous years.And in British Columbia, a survey of nursing home residents and their families by the province’s seniors advocate published last month found a seven per cent rate of increase in antipsychotic use, and a three per cent rate of increase in antidepressant use during the time of visitor restrictions for COVID.“This rate of increase is significant and is one indicator of the potential unintended consequences of the visitor restriction policies,” the report states.READ MORE:B.C.’s largest COVID-19 care-home outbreak records 19 deaths, 147 casesIn Quebec, Nouha Ben Gaied, director of research and development for the Federation of Quebec Alzheimer Societies, says over the last two years, more than 100 nursing homes have taken part in a provincial initiative that promotes non-pharmacological strategies for patients with dementia and reducing antipsychotics. The pandemic halted the program.With “a very heavy heart,” her colleagues turned to chemical and physical restraints to enforce infection-control measures in Quebec’s hard-hit nursing homes, Ben Gaied said. “This is not something that they wanted to do, but this was the only solution they had.”Staff reported that not only were physical barriers put up to keep people confined to their rooms, but medications such as antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and other sleeping medications have been used to sedate and restrict the movement of people with dementia in units affected by COVID with the goal of protecting residents from harm.Such measures fail to uphold a person’s dignity, and she says the stigma of dementia can lead to a curtailing of their rights. Care providers in nursing homes often “forget about the rights of people with dementia, but we should empower (residents) instead of saying ‘you don’t have the right to do certain things’ … or ‘this is to protect you.’”Geriatrics experts are concerned that the global pandemic is undoing years of hard-won progress in reducing the use of potentially dangerous and ineffective medications in the elderly and those with dementia.Stall also sees these trends as indicators of something even more sinister: the pandemic response may have resulted in more mood disorders and behavioural disturbances for people with dementia.Dr. Fred Mather, president of Ontario Long Term Care Clinicians and the medical director at Sunnyside Home in Kitchener, Ont., explains that unfortunately, not only are medications such as antipsychotics associated with significant side-effects, but they have also been proven ineffective in treating responsive behaviours in dementia.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });He characterizes “responsive behaviours” as distressing behaviours, such as hitting or grabbing, exhibited by people with dementia that put themselves or others at risk. The current understanding of these behaviours is that they are not symptoms of dementia, Mather says, but rather, “a form of communication that needs to be addressed about an unmet need.”And unmet needs, such as confusion, loneliness or boredom – which Stall has seen worsen under strict visitor restrictions and social isolation in Ontario’s nursing homes – are not best treated with medication.Geriatric psychiatrist Dr. Andrea Iaboni, who practises at the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute and in several nursing homes, notes that “there’s no such thing as a medication that will make someone stay in their room – there’s no pill for that.”“If you don’t have the capacity to remember that there’s a pandemic, or don’t have insight into the fact that you might be at risk or that people around you are at risk (of COVID), it becomes very hard to adhere to (infection control) measures,” Iaboni says of people living with dementia and cognitive impairment.She has helped create a social isolation toolkit for long-term care providers to plan for how to best protect residents from the novel coronavirus while preserving a quality of life.Iaboni says that if medications are used, they need to be monitored very closely, as residents on antipsychotics are “going to be more sleepy or more confused, maybe more unsteady in their gait and more at risk of an adverse event,” such as a fall.While she hasn’t seen evidence of widespread use of antipsychotics as chemical restraints, Iaboni says she’s getting more referrals for “mental health problems such as depression and even psychotic depression, or the development of delirium or psychosis.”Iaboni described how isolation requirements for residents exposed to or infected with the virus “are kind of like putting them in solitary confinement and under those circumstances, people start to hallucinate, they start to develop delusions” – which would be an appropriate indication to prescribe an antipsychotic.Stall says the rising prescription rates found in his research reflect what family caregivers have been telling him and what he has been seeing in his own clinical work: high levels of distress among residents who have been isolated and separated from essential care providers and loved ones.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });He says a new approach is needed to address the social and mental-health needs of long-term care home residents.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-6');gptRefreshSlots.push(6); });“I think about my grandmother, about going for a walk around the block.

One of the residents deemed a “close contact” to the initial staff case has tested positive.“We received confirmation of this positive result on November 18,” said Island Health in a press release. “As a precautionary measure, the resident will be transferred out of the facility and that is expected to occur on the evening of November 18. This is only precautionary and this resident is not experiencing any symptoms at this time.”All other test results for residents and staff have come back negative so far, says Island Health.READ MORE: More than 50 people tested after Nanaimo hospital outbreak, all tests negativeREAD MORE: At least 86 of the Island’s fall COVID-19 cases were people who travelledAccording to the initial press release on Tuesday, one staff member had tested positive for COVID-19, but no residents were experiencing symptoms. With COVID-19, it is a provincial standard to declare an outbreak if at least one staff member is at work during their infectious period, said North Island Medical Health Officer Dr. Charmaine Enns.“It’s a very concerning word,” she said during a virtual press conference on Tuesday. “But we’re talking about a single case. By definition, we expect zero cases of COVID-19 in our long-term care facilities. [One case] exceeds the number we are aiming to have in a particular site.”Rainbow Gardens is a not-for-profit facility operated by WestCoast Native Health Care Society. At this time, there are 44 residents in long-term care, said Enns.“There have been three residents identified as close contacts, based on their interactions with staff,” she said. “All are asymptomatic.”These three residents have been isolated in their rooms, the unit where their rooms are located has been isolated from the rest of the building and staff movement has been restricted to that unit.She said the outbreak is considered a “low-risk exposure” because the staff member did not have symptoms on the days they were working and immediately stayed home and started self-isolating when symptoms occurred.“This staff member did everything right,” Enns explained.Communication with residents and families is underway. The outbreak is confined to the long-term care building and no other areas of the site are affected. The entire site is closed to admissions, transfers and visitors.In the meantime, Island Health is working with Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens leadership and staff to identify anyone who may have been exposed. During this time, Island Health will have additional presence at the site to take any further actions required, support the facility and answer questions from staff, residents and family members.The outbreak is not linked to any other outbreaks on the Island, Enns said. With COVID-19 cases increasing on Vancouver Island, Enns explained that it is becoming harder to identify where cases have originated.“The fact that we are seeing ever-increasing numbers, it’s going to spill over into places,” she said. “I’m just hoping we don’t feel discouraged. We’re still doing good. Let’s just regroup and get refocused on all of our efforts. Let’s keep our circles as small as possible, let’s stay home as much as possible…so that these facilities are not impacted.”She encouraged people to limit travel—including inter-Island travel—to essential trips only.READ MORE: Stop non-essential travel B.C.-wide, Dr. Bonnie Henry urgesAccording to a press release, Island Health has put “enhanced control measures” in place at Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens, including the following measures:Staffing levels will be maintained to provide resident care.Visitors are restricted throughout the facility.Staff and resident movement in the facility has been restricted.Cleaning and infection control measures have been enhanced.Residents, families and staff are being notified.Twice a day screening of all staff and residents.For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie heard tragic stories of the effects of strict visitor restrictions, where relatives who had helped seniors with meals, hair brushing and other essential personal assistance were told to keep their distance, shorten visits, or not visit at all.“Many residents are despondent as the only thing they look forward to is receiving a visit from their family,” Mackenzie wrote in herlatestreport, released Nov. 3. “There are also early warning signs of measurable health impacts. After many recent years of stability, the rate of antipsychotic use for residents in long-term care has increased seven per cent during this pandemic and initial reports from the quarterly assessments show troubling trends of unintended weight loss and worsening of mood among long-term care residents.”A quarter of long-term care residents die each year, and end-of-life visitation was affected as well as day-to-day help. More than eight out of 10 respondents indicated that before the pandemic, their loved one had additional people such as paid companions, physical therapists or hairdressers to help them. Personal care services are considered essential by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, along with assistance in feeding, mobility and communication, such as using a phone.Visits were restricted to essential only in March after COVID-19 transmission began in care facilities, and on June 28 one “social” visitor was allowed. The report found that most care home operators went beyond the public health orders in restricting visits to a single person. The report included some personal descriptions of the results of separation for up to six months. One resident said her sister became the designated visitor for their 98-year-old mother, meaning she couldn’t visit and her sister had to provide what both had shared.“I have asked if we could alternate monthly, one month my sister, the next month me; however this was refused,” the respondent wrote. “My mother can’t understand why I don’t visit her. I was not allowed to go in and do her hair or cut her toenails, even though I have done that for the past two decades, yet a stranger was allowed to come and do those services.”RELATED:B.C. seniors fear loneliness more than COVID-19RELATED:COVID-19 exposed senior care already in crisisAnother wrote: “I feel I am missing out on the limited time my husband has left. He doesn’t speak, so it is all the more important that he sees me. It’s interesting that the assisted living residents have the freedom to come and go, from the same building and door, with no masks. And yet I can’t get within six feet of my husband. I have asked several times to be considered an essential visitor. I need help.”Mackenzie says the issue of restricted visits has generated more phone calls and letters to her office than any other in its history. Her recommendations include allowing all long-term care residents to designate and essential care partner, and allow social visitors to determine the number allowed to balance the risk to residents’ health from long-term separation from families.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."
95,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/b-c-seniors-worry-more-about-death-from-loneliness-than-covid-19/,"Nov 3, 2020",B.C. seniors worry more about death from loneliness than COVID-19,"Seniors in B.C. long-term care and assisted living facilities are seeing reduced visits and missing out on the volunteer care as well as the companionship they provide, a new survey by B.C.’s Seniors Advocate has found.All non-essential visits were stopped in March after outbreaks in senior homes began occurring, and effective June 28, one “social” visitor was allowed in addition to essential visits. A survey of 13,000 people from all B.C. health regions through August and September found a significant drop in frequency and duration of visits, and widespread misunderstanding of public health rules relating to visitors.The results show that more care home residents and relatives are concerned about dying of loneliness than from COVID-19, Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said in the report, released Nov. 3“When the visit restrictions were amended at the end of June, many family members thought they would once again take up their role as a vital care partner for their loved one,” Mackenzie said in thereport. “However, two months after visit restrictions were relaxed, the survey found the majority of current visits are only once per week or less and many of these visits are 30 minutes or less, Prior to the pandemic, most family members were visiting several times a week or daily for much longer periods of time.”The survey results suggest “essential” visits have been too strictly interpreted by care home staff and frequent visitors. The report says essential visits have been defined by provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry, in addition to the designated “social” visitor. Essential visits “can include, but are not limited to” assistance with feeding, mobility, personal care, communication, and “compassionate care including critical illness, palliative care, hospice care, end of life and medical assistance in dying.”Decisions on who qualifies as an essential visitor were left to individual care homes to determine. Of the 13,000 survey respondents, 14 per cent said they were essential visitors. Fewer than half (48 per cent) of respondents were made aware of the potential for essential visits, only 42 per cent of respondents applied or had another family member apply for essential visits, and almost half (45 per cent) of the essential visit applications were denied.RELATED:COVID-19 exposed senior care already in crisisRELATED:Senior home residents organize to oppose restrictions“When we started visit restrictions, the goal was to ensure residents in long-term care and assisted living were kept safe from COVID-19,” Mackenzie said. “Eight months later, we need to ask the question: What are we keeping them safe for if it is not to enjoy the time they have left with the ones they love?”Mackenzie makes three recommendations:• Allow all residents to designate an essential care partner• Allow social visitors to determine the number allowed by balancing the risk to a resident’s health from the long-term family separations• Create a provincial association of long-term care and assisted living residents and family councils.@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

However, most outbreaks have been smaller than the first time around.COVID-19 hit Canada’s long-term care homes hardest during the first wave of the pandemic. The Public Health Agency notes that as of August, Canada had one of the highest fatality rates among long-term care home residents out of the 37 countries in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development.Tam’s report noted that globally, Canada ranked 79th out of 201 countries in terms of total cases per million population and 26th for total deaths per million population, driven mainly by the situation in long-term care.Also, people working in essential services were at higher risk of exposure, with health-care workers accounting for 19 per cent of national cases as of mid-August and outbreaks reported in 23 agricultural workplaces during the same time frame.On Wednesday, Statistics Canada said the more than 7,000 excess deaths recorded during March and June are comparable to COVID-19 figures from the Canadian Vital Statistics Death Database — the official source of death-related data in Canada.The statistics agency said the number of deaths dipped to normal levels in July but has surged again during the first 10 days of October, surpassing monthly totals for August and September and suggesting Canada will see an increase in excess deaths this month.Excess mortality, more deaths than usual during a period of time, is an important measure in understanding both the direct and indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.“I think it shows the majority of excess can be accounted for by COVID-19,” Tam said. “But there could be other excess mortality, sometimes as a result of some of the measures that we’ve put in.”Tam’s report noted that opioid deaths also increased, with evidence suggesting the pandemic has created a setback as border restrictions led to a more toxic illegal drug supply.Sidhartha Banerjee, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

The benefits are numerous, she said.“The fact that they’re walking and they’re stretching and they’re reaching and touching things and even pausing to take a deep breath, in a way is wonderful for their physical [selves]…” van der Stoel said. “We had an elder who I was sitting out there with, and she just naturally began to speak about some of the difficulties of her childhood, but that nature for her was always an escape and was always a safe place. From that moment, she voiced to me that she felt safe, that she felt happy. She was able to process some of these emotions that I don’t think elders are often given the opportunity to process, but in that, she felt totally safe and secure.”RELATED:Mural unveiled at Nanaimo’s Eden GardensThe space has extra value as the pandemic has put limitations on residents, van der Stoel said. She said there have been fewer opportunities for social stimulation and because of that, loneliness and sadness.“These people miss their families and miss the routine that was existing before,” said van der Stoel. “For anybody who’s experiencing deep sadness like that, I think that nature can bring moments of peace, maybe not permanently, but at least for half an hour they get to feel peace and hopefulness and growth and vibrancy around them.”Ruth Brownstone and Shirley Petersen, residents at Eden Gardens, said they enjoy the forest.“I come out here every day to get out of the building, so it is very beneficial, so that I can have some kind of place of peace,” said Brownstone.“I like to be outdoors all the time and I don’t like to feel that I am actually in a building when I really am,” said Petersen. “I would like to not be in a building and so, to have a place of peace … it’s quite good so far.”People seeking to help out can contact van der Stoel at 250-760-2636 or atbianca.vanderstoel@edengardens.ca.

In total, 213 people are hospitalized in Ontario because of COVID-19; 47 people are in intensive care and 29 are on ventilators.The picture wasn’t any prettier in Quebec, which reported another 1,097 new cases on Saturday — the sixth day out of the last seven that the province surpassed 1,000 new cases.Quebec also reported 14 additional deaths. Hospitalizations rose by 11 to 444, and six more people were in intensive care, for a total of 73.In response, the province was set to expand restrictions in nearly all the regions along the St. Lawrence River between Montreal and Quebec City on Saturday night.Bars, restaurant dining rooms and gyms in so-called “red zones” must be closed, sports are limited and private citizens are not allowed to gather in private homes with anyone outside their household, with few exceptions.In Manitoba, health officials reported two more deaths from COVID-19, as well as 97 new cases.The province said in its daily pandemic update on Saturday that two women in Winnipeg — one in her 80s and another in her 90s — had died since the last update on Friday.Public health officials also reminded people that residents of personal care homes are especially vulnerable to COVID-19, and that any visits over the Thanksgiving weekend should be planned with caution.Even the Atlantic bubble seems to have been perforated by the pandemic’s second wave.There were 20 new cases of COVID-19 in New Brunswick on Saturday, bringing the province’s total number of active cases to 57.The province’s chief medical officer of health said 12 of the new cases are in the Moncton region and seven are in the Campbellton region.

The competition features playdowns in more than 30 sports and activities between 12 zone teams from around the province, and can attract upwards of 3,600 athletes and 1,200 volunteers.The society recently added a pair of key newcomers to its board at its annual general meeting on Sept. 17, installing Surrey’s Aart Looye as president and Esquimalt’s Sharon Davies as marketing and sponsorship committee chair.RELATED STORY:55+ BC Games cancelled amid COVID-19 concernsDavies, an accomplished amateur athlete and organizer with varied professional and volunteer experience in strategic planning, promotions and fundraising, is excited to serve on the society’s board.“It’s a great opportunity to give back and try to promote an active lifestyle,” she said. For participants, she added, “it’s an opportunity to continue to compete in a sport that you love, but it is also about participation and having fun.”While the society is monitoring provincial health regulations around COVID-19 as it plans its next attempt at staging the Games, Davies, a Bays United women’s soccer player, is encouraged at the work being done by various sports organizations in Greater Victoria to come up with Safe Return to Play protocols. She hopes the Games can draw on those experiences to create a safe environment for all participants.From an economic standpoint, hosting a 55+ BC Games can be a lucrative proposition, Davies said, as all visiting participants book hotel rooms, eat in local restaurants and enjoy other activities while in the host city. It’s not uncommon for participants to extend their stays.Davies’ duties as committee chair will include securing funding from sponsors.

102,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/sports/salmon-arm-woman-one-of-the-oldest-competitive-bowlers-in-western-canada/,"Oct 4, 2020",Salmon Arm woman one of the oldest competitive bowlers in Western Canada,"Florence Pineo’s game scores may not top the charts, but it’s her love of the game that keeps her coming back.Knowing that she would soon be 98 years old, the staff at Lakeside Bowling reached out to Bowl BC and concluded that the Salmon Arm woman is among the oldest competitive bowlers in all of Western Canada.Following her Thursday, Oct. 1 game in which she shared a lane with her sister Louise, Pineo reflected on both her 117 point game and just how special bowling is to her.Pineo said she has been bowling in the league at Lakeside Bowling for 26 years. She took the game up alongside Louise after retiring at 71 years old. She described the senior league as good exercise, but said the social aspect is every bit as important with many friendships forged between the lanes.Although she is no longer averaging the 192 point games she once did, Pineo is still more than capable of putting in a good ten frames. She attributes this longevity to family history and an overall healthy lifestyle.“I’m very careful with my health, I don’t drink or smoke and I rest a lot, I’m just a healthy person,” she said.“I think it’s good for you, you can’t just sit around on the chesterfield waiting to die or that sort of thing. You should remain active and keep the proper perspective.”Pineo was happy to discover that the league, which usually runs from September until May, was able to reopen. It had been stopped short due to COVID-19 in the spring. She said the virus made it difficult to get out and do things she enjoys for much of the year, so the return of the bowling league was a welcome return to a treasured routine.READ MORE:BC Votes 2020: Horgan talks mass timber, climate targets in visit to RevelstokeREAD MORE:Confronting their addictions to make way for healing — a B.C. love storyjim.elliot@saobserver.netLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"
103,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/the-state-of-aging-covid-19-exposed-a-long-term-care-system-already-in-crisis/,"Oct 3, 2020",The State of Aging: COVID-19 exposed a long-term care system already in crisis,"By 2021, the number of seniors in Canada is projected to exceed the number of children aged 14 and younger – for the first time ever. This means more Canadians will be entering an already stressed care system.According to demographic projections from Statistics Canada, the number of seniors is expected to increase rapidly until 2031, when all baby boomers will have reached age 65, with the most rapid growth in seniors over the age of 85. By 2036, seniors could represent up to 25 per cent of the total population.“We’ve got to plan for that,” said Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie. “The population is aging, there’s going to be more people, we need more long-term care.”The Office of the Seniors Advocate analyzes services and issues B.C. seniors face. Headed by Mackenzie, it also makes recommendations to government and service providers to address systemic issues. With this changing demographic, Mackenzie said the government needs to take steps to plan ahead for individuals who don’t have the means or the ability to do that for themselves.Entrenched in the wrong systemWith roots in the Elizabethan Poor Law of 1601, not the health care system, Canada’s long-term care (LTC) sector was first established as poorhouses, county homes, parishes, poor farms and almshouses – housing people who were unable to care for themselves. Over time, different groups were separated into facilities with housing specifically for older adults gradually introduced during the early 20th century. LTC remains outside universally insured health services protected by the Canada Health Act.Commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada, a report was released in June that focused on 24-hour residential LTC and the impact of the novel coronavirus. The report found provincial and territorial plans are disparate and piecemeal, while the Canada Health Act does not protect or ensure universal LTC. With different levels of government oversight and legislation, jurisdictions offer different ranges of services and cost coverage, meaning there is little consistency across the nation in the level of care offered, how it is measured, how facilities are governed, who owns them, or even what they are called.“Concerns about quality of care and safety persist, tragic events continue, inequities deepen, root issues are not challenged, older adults suffer needlessly, and many Canadians are truly frightened at the prospect that they themselves may need to be admitted to a nursing home,” the report states.While the majority of seniors live independently – 72 per cent of people over the age of 85 live on their own and are able to take care of most of their own care needs – the older an individual gets, the more complex their care needs become.But 30 years from now, a typical 85-year-old will be quite different than an 85-year-old today. They’re less likely to be married and have children – the typical care-providers for seniors – and a larger percentage will have lived in a multi-unit residence.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-3');gptRefreshSlots.push(3); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-4');gptRefreshSlots.push(4); });Individuals who have lived in condos are more likely to make that shift back, as they are comfortable with the environment. Whereas today, Mackenzie said most seniors are used to single-family homes. They’re reluctant to give up theses homes and wait too long to downsize, which means many end up in care homes.“If you look at where people are living and where they want to live, we’ll need more long-term care beds.”The current situationA report prepared last fall by Westbridge Group Valuation Partner, paid for by the Saunders Family Foundation, examined existing LTC beds in Greater Victoria and found an urgent need for more on the West Shore, with most located in the core municipalities.Historically, health authorities in B.C. held a target of 75 funded LTC beds per 1,000 seniors aged 75 and up – but the current provincial average is lower, according to the report. In 2019, there were an estimated 69 funded long-term care beds per 1,000 seniors aged 75 and over.In Greater Victoria, the report estimated there are 36,785 residents over the age of 75 – approximately 9.5 per cent of the population. In the entire region, the report found 2,680 funded long-term care beds – 665 private-pay, 398 funded assisted living suites, as well as 2,037 for-profit assisted living suites and 544 not-for-profit assisted living suites. There are also 10 hospice beds at Victoria Hospice (Royal Jubilee Hospital), 10 at the Saanich Peninsula Hospital, and two in Sooke’s Ayre Manor.ALSO READ:West Shore seniors forced to relocate, no hospice careMark Blandford, Island Health’s former executive director of primary care and seniors health, told Black Press Media in August that 40 people a week are placed into care on Vancouver Island.“Fifteen per cent of people going into a care bed today fit the profile of care that can be provided in the community.”The current LTC system lumps all levels of care together.“This has an impact,” Mackenzie explained. Some individuals don’t have complex care needs but don’t have the ability to get care outside LTC.“They don’t need to be in the environment we have.”As Canadians live longer, the prevalence of chronic diseases, especially dementia, and other social challenges have also increased. This means more Canadians will be living with Alzheimer’s disease and other age-related dementias – an umbrella term for a set of degenerative brain disorders. Today, one in 40 Canadians aged 65 to 74 and one in three over the age of 85 have aged-related dementia, according to Statistics Canada. More than two-thirds of seniors with dementia will require nursing home care.Residents are entering nursing homes with more complex social and medical needs which have raised the level of care required at these facilities – even compared to just a decade ago. The highly critical peer-reviewed report commissioned by the Royal Society of Canada found in response to these challenges, hands-on care is now almost entirely given by unregulated workers including care aides and personal support workers. These employees receive the lowest wages in the health care sector, minimal formal training and are rarely part of the decision-making process.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-5');gptRefreshSlots.push(5); });googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-6');gptRefreshSlots.push(6); });The main issues Mackenzie sees are also in regards to staffing, including the number of hours a client receives, experience, training, cultural sensitivity and engagement. And those issues aren’t all fixed by having an adequate number of staff on site.Who is providing care?The LTC sector increasingly relies on unpaid care by family members and friends of residents.These caregivers are disproportionally women, who provide many different care activities. However, the report found society gives little attention to respite for these caregivers or to the negative effects of their caregiving burdens.Exacerbating this problem, by 2050, approximately 30 per cent fewer close family members (spouses and adult children) will be available to give this unpaid care. Relying on these caregivers leaves the LTC sector especially vulnerable in a crisis, such as COVID-19. Reports from Europe and now Canada found many preventable deaths occurred during the early waves of the pandemic and some were even from a lack of timely access to care, water, food or basic hygiene, not from COVID-19 itself.“It epitomizes our failure … this was more than a communicable disease crisis,” the report states. “Canada has systematically failed to deal with the consequences of population trends in aging, dementia prevalence and fewer family caregivers for older adults.”Mackenzie echoed the sentiment of the report’s authors, “COVID didn’t break the system, COVID exposed the system.”While B.C. fared much better than other provinces – Ontario especially – she said B.C. is far from perfect.ALSO READ:B.C. retirement home residents fight province’s visitor restrictionsHow do we fix it?The Office of the Minister of Seniors noted the federal government has been assisting provinces and territories to address these gaps to keep residents safe.“Despite the improvements in many of the hardest-hit homes, significant work remains to address the challenges the virus poses to long-term care. The government of Canada is continuing to work with the provinces and territories to help address these issues.”But if nothing else is done immediately, staffing levels also need to be addressed. Authors of the report are urging the federal government to develop national standards for staffing and training.“Canada’s reality is that, without federal financial support, provincial and territorial governments are unlikely to have resources for the high standards that our frail elderly deserve,” they stated.Along with staffing, Mackenzie noted the key to addressing shortfalls in the system is getting services into the community. “We need to look at the supports leading up to long-term care,” she said. “We don’t have very much subsidized assisted living.”Listening to seniors who want to stay in their communities, she said it’s clear these supports are needed. While she believes the proximity of these services will only improve, she noted there’s speculation COVID-19 will reverse this current trend.googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-7');gptRefreshSlots.push(7); });But as the report stated, “We have a duty, a responsibility, and the ability to fix this – not just fix the current communicable disease crisis, but fix the sector that helped that crisis wreak such avoidable and tragic havoc. We can restore trust.”Find more information in ourRedefining the State of Aging resource guidefor Greater Victoria.For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.– with files from Don Descoteaukatie.e@blackpress.caDo you have a story tip?

106,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/lessons-from-a-pandemic-how-to-design-a-nursing-home-thats-safe-and-love-filled/,"Oct 1, 2020",Lessons from a pandemic: How to design a nursing home that’s safe and love-filled,"By Martha Perkins, Local Journalism Initiative Reporter, North Shore NewsThe images were heartbreaking — a senior citizen, alone in their nursing home bedroom while, on the other side of the window, a family member stands outside and tries to establish some kind of connection to ease the sense of isolation and foreboding.Surely, people said, there has to be a better way to keep residents of care facilities safe while also allowing them to be with their families.Baptist Housing is working on it. The coronavirus pandemic has unexpectedly provided new insights into how nursing homes should be designed to help control the spread of any type of illness. The timing is especially beneficial as Baptist Housing works on its plans for the first phase of the Inglewood Care Centre redevelopment.This past February, BC Housing financed the sale of the aging facility and three adjacent lots to Baptist Housing, which owns and operates 21 care homes in British Columbia. With a large financial commitment from the province, as well as Vancouver Coastal Health, Baptist Housing came up with plan to subsidize the construction of a replacement care home by creating a community of housing on the site. The total of 699 proposed units also includes private-pay units, life leases and rental apartments for staff.In mid-September, the District of West Vancouver allowed the project to move to the public consultation stage.In advance of the first public open house on Oct. 6, the North Shore News talked with Howard Johnson, Baptist Housing CEO and president, and Marc Kinna, executive vice-president operations and chief operating officer. They walked through some of the ways they’re adapting traditional nursing home designs to ensure residents and staff can enjoy a better quality of life and work during a pandemic.“COVID-19 has taught us about the risk of bringing a virus from the outside world into the residences of these seniors,” Kinna says. “We have to remember that they don’t life where we work we work in their home. This has really transformed our thinking around that.”As well, the changes will keep residents healthier, pandemic or not. “Every single design element that will make the building better, and the experience better for residents, also applies to other forms of illness,” he says. “We’re hoping that the incidence of other communicable illnesses such as influenza, the Norwalk virus and the common cold will be lesser as well.”Because many of these design changes can be incorporated into the original plans, they are optimistic they won’t add much to the overall cost of the construction.Room, sweet room"
107,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/business/new-seniors-housing-complex-proposed-for-port-alberni/,"Sep 23, 2020",New seniors’ housing complex proposed for Port Alberni,"A new seniors complex has been proposed for Port Alberni.The Vancouver Resource Society (VRS) is hoping to build a seniors housing project at Anderson Hill, on the former Alberni District Secondary School site.The planned facility will be a five-storey building with 102 units for seniors and people with disabilities, as well as a one-storey clubhouse with amenities like a fitness room, games room, lounge, dining room and commercial kitchen.The project is aimed at independent seniors, explained VRS director of operations Martin Gardner in a presentation to Port Alberni city council on Monday, Sept. 14. Twenty to 25 percent of the units will be regular rentals, with “a la carte” services offered from the clubhouse. This model will allow seniors to age in place.“We’re really trying to attract a younger, more active senior,” said Gardner. “People can move in at a younger age and live there as long as possible. You have access to meal programs and recreational programs as you choose.”The new facility will be called “Timberline at North Park” and will be located on Anderson Avenue and North Park Drive.Ken Fraser, VRS executive director, explained to council that the organization has applied for grant funding from BC Housing and Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). Without this grant funding, the average price for a one-bedroom unit is estimated to be around $1,070.“I know that’s probably expensive for the Port Alberni market,” said Fraser. “That’s our worst case scenario, but we’re cautiously optimistic that BC Housing or CMHC will help us out with some affordability here.”The organization still needs to apply for a development permit from the city, after which construction is expected to begin in January or February of 2021, said director of development Brad Tone.Mayor and council expressed support for the project on Monday. Councillor Debbie Haggard praised the “age in place” approach to the facility.“I know many active seniors,” Haggard said. “They’re active and they’re younger seniors, but they don’t want the maintenance of owning their own home. They don’t want to do the maintenance in the yard anymore. They want the flexibility to travel. I think you’re going to be full up very quickly.”elena.rardon@albernivalleynews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

109,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/community/the-journey-never-ends-for-these-ambitious-hiking-seniors/,"Aug 16, 2020",The journey never ends for these ambitious hiking seniors,"Nine years ago, a few friends decided to start a hiking group. And not just any hiking group, but one where they fly to remote locations in a helicopter.The four Qualicum Beach men, all in their 70s, have been doing so for almost a decade – camping, exploring and hiking together during an annual trip in July.Roger Griffiths, the guide for the group, has been doing outdoor expeditions for 40 years. He started in England and then in Canada – teaching climbing, backpacking and more along the way. He also has an expedition to the Himalayas under his belt, which he says was a “long, long time ago,” with a laugh.He took a break from the lifestyle for a few years while working for a municipality, but had his passion reignited when he retired to Qualicum Beach 14 years ago.“A couple of the guys in our walking group were talking about doing something and they knew I’d done some stuff, so I just said, ‘well I’ve got a few places we could go,’” he said. “And that’s how it started.”Fast forward to last month, the group was able to make it up to Tweedsmuir South Provincial Park in central B.C. Griffiths said he chose this location, like he often has, by scouting around for places on Google Earth. Things he looks out for include: alpine terrain; spots that are above 6,000 feet and, of course, good hiking. Griffiths and the group flies in on a helicopter to their base camp and then does day hikes from there.READ MORE:Parksville Qualicum Beach seniors get a kick out of ’walking soccer’“This year, it was quite windy and stormy, but we did a hike every day and had two really nice, sunny days,” he said. “We’re all good friends and know each other quite well, so it’s pretty relaxed. Now, after nine years, we’re into a routine. I do the cooking, they do washing up, I decide where we’re going hiking, they toodle along with me.”Geoff Relph has also been there from the beginning and said it’s been a true pleasure being lead through hidden areas of the province by Griffiths.“We are truly privileged to have the wherewithal to whistle up a helicopter and go flying off into the backcountry, I absolutely recognize that,” he said. “Having said that, it’s been fantastic over the last nine years and naturally, we’ve seen grizzly bear and caribou and moose and sheep and fox and wolves.”Looking forward, Griffiths said the group is probably going to call next year their last. For their 10th year, they plan to return to the same spot where they first started nine years ago at Iron Pass in Pemberton.“We thought that would be a good thing to do,” he said. “[We’re] a bit slower, but that’s OK. We adjust. We’re all getting a little bit slower, but we all still do pretty good hikes.”“I think we’re not an average group, we’re very lucky to be very healthy. Two of the guys are still playing soccer on a regular basis, I work out, I snowboard,” said Relph.“So, we’re an active group and a healthy group… that’s the story, a bunch of old guys have been hiking now for nine years, hoping for 10.”For more news from Vancouver Island and beyond delivered daily into your inbox, pleaseclick here.cloe.logan@pqbnews.comLikeusonFacebookandfollowusonTwitterOutdoors and RecreationParksvilleSeniors"
110,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/opinion/boomer-talk-bureaucracy-can-be-bad-for-your-health/,"Aug 11, 2020",BOOMER TALK: Bureaucracy can be bad for your health,"By Carole FawcettI never do well when confronted with bureaucracy. I do recognize that some guidelines are necessary for any business, but it seems we have become obsessed and ruled by them.With ‘policies and procedures’ people seem to lose their common sense along the way, creating a situation where a business or agency is forced to operate on what it says in the policies and procedures binder, as opposed to what is best for the client, patient or consumer.It seems that flexibility in dealing with a situation is completely lost when these rules become rigid. They are so rigid they become brittle and as we know things that are brittle tend to break easily and no longer function efficiently, perhaps discounting the needs of a human being.RELATED: B.C. employer health tax wins ‘paperweight award’ for red tapeRELATED: Governments should modernize their processes, get with the times for 2020I bumped into that just recently when attempting to accommodate the needs of my 96-year-old mother who had fallen and broken her clavicle. I was told that she would qualify to have Interior Health Authority care aides come in and assist her.So, a very nice someone came out from the Community Care group, assessed mom’s living situation (she lives in supportive housing) and said she would qualify for care aides.Mom and I had a chat about what would be most helpful. Apparently care aides only help with bathing once per week (unless the client is incontinent).A once a week shower or bath is not enough to feel fresh and clean, even if you are not incontinent. This impacts an individuals’ mental wellbeing too. If you feel unclean, it may impact your desire to socialize – something that is very important as we age.With mom, they did agree to help with the shower twice a week, but the shower was offered at 1:30 p.m. So that would mean she would dress in the a.m., (‘cause its frowned upon to go to lunch in your jammies) then undress at 1:30 for the shower and then dress again, then undress again at night when she went to bed.That would be four times she would have to dress and undress in one day. Broken clavicles are painful and can impede the ability to dress and undress.They are not allowed to bring food up from the kitchen area, because somewhere in their infamous binders of policies and procedures it states they cannot ‘transport food.’They are not allowed to walk patients down hallways for exercise, but will walk with them to the dining room for lunch. It was suggested by a young nurse that perhaps the care aide could ‘remind’ mom to walk down the hall, by herself. It’s not a matter of remembering, it’s a matter of being safe.Boggles the mind doesn’t it?I find the resistance to walking down the hall with a senior puzzling, as in the IHA’s own information about seniors, it states: “The prevention and reduction of falls among seniors is of particular importance, and B.C. is considered a world leader in this field.”Walking alongside a fragile senior who uses a walker would reassure the senior and a way for the care aide to assess how well they are doing. They could also help the client take a moment to sit on their walker if necessary.This is important to know Boomers, because bureaucracy tends to grow exponentially. You’ll need an advocate to make sure you are being looked after properly if this happens to you.I believe we must acknowledge the important work that care aides do, pay them accordingly and perhaps increase their training. They are vital to the quality of the lives of those they help. We need to allow care aides to be flexible enough to help others in a respectful and empowering manner.Just so you know, everyone I spoke with was polite, but they are, unfortunately, puppets of the system.We need to change the bureaucratic policies and procedures and make them more humane. Health care bureaucracy has lost sight that it is dealing with human beings.Carole Fawcett is a freelance writer, retired counsellor and humouristwww.wordaffair.com.

The study found that women who were single, widowed, divorced or separated had higher likelihood of being affected by general obesity than men.“There is a lot of literature suggesting that marriage is health-promoting for men and potentially less so for women, so our results about marital status were kind of surprising,” said Annalijn Conklin, principal investigator of the study and assistant professor in pharmaceutical sciences at UBC.Zeinab Hosseini, lead author of the study, said in a press release that more research is needed to completely “understand the factors at work,” but suggested that more needs to be done to encourage older women to build social ties.“This would require clear implementation strategies, and a focus on social connection interventions by health care researchers and decision-makers,” said Hosseini.ALSO READ:Canadians not getting enough light exercise during pandemic, UBC study findsConklin added that building these social ties could include activities like visiting friends and family, and engaging in group hobbies that encourage older adults to build connections outside their existing circles.The study did not investigate why these gender differences exist, but Conklin suggested that they may be due to social expectations of gender roles.“The type of work we did was taking a big data set and looking at how relationships affect men and women,” said Conklin. “That topic would require a completely different type of study, and maybe that’s the next step.”Like us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism?

The lunch-box menu consisted of barbecue salmon with salad and rice noodles, a homemade bun and cookies.Ann Vasnick, the president of SCRA who organized the event – which was supposed to have been a sit-down lunch during spring – said it had to be cancelled due to the pandemic. Instead, with physical distancing measures being more important while organizing events for high-risk groups like seniors, they decided to deliver.Mowi had already agreed to deliver the salmon for the lunch, but then stepped up and offered to bring up their mobile barbecue to prepare it as well, said Vansnick“The older people always look forward to seeing their friends at the event. Since most of them don’t live close to each other, they don’t always get to see other people,” said Vansnick about how the social event is uplifting for the seniors.In Sayward, the tradition of has been ongoing for many years and was originally started as a Christmas dinner event for seniors by Joyce Dustins. After her death, the SCRA decided to start a spring lunch event last year in her honour, said Vansnick.ALSO IN NEWS: Mining and exploration industries donate $100K to B.C. food banksFish FarmsSaywardSeniors"

He simply loves the game.At the tender age of 91, Barnes is not about to quit.Though he is not as spry as he once was and now plays from the front tees at his favourite course, Eaglecrest Golf Club, his playing buddies enjoy having him around because Barnes can consistently play well every time out.Russ Mitchell, who is 67 years old and a single-digit handicap player with 50 years of golf experience, had the opportunity to play with Barnes recently. He was very impressed when Barnes carded an 83.“He could have easily shot a 79 if a few putts had dropped on the back nine,” said Mitchell. “Bruce plays from the forward (yellow) tees which does not make golf much easier, as I consider Eaglecrest one of the tougher golf course to score on.”READ MORE: ‘It’s never too late to get strong’: B.C. grandma deadlifts twice her weight for the goldBarnes agreed, saying “‘could have’ is the magic word. I have been averaging between 82 and 83 so far this year.”Barnes, who will turn 92 in December, has been playing golf for close to 75 years. He said it was not his favourite sport initially. It was hockey first and when he was 17, Barnes got challenged to try golf and he has been playing ever since.Over the years, he has played in various tournaments and when he got older entered the B.C. Seniors Golf Championships and Canadian Seniors Championships.He has won the Eaglecrest Senior Club title seven times he said and has also won club trophies in other courses.So how does he still maintain his golf game?“I don’t know if I have a secret,” said Barnes. “I concentrate quite well and I have a good short game. That enables me to shoot a reasonable score.”When he was lot younger, Barnes said he played six times a week. He counts himself truly fortunate to still be able to play golf.“I am a pancreatic cancer survivor,” said Barnes. “It will be 10 years this coming November that I have recovered from this. I love playing golf. I have difficulty walking now and have to drive the cart close to the ball now pretty much. But I don’t have any other difficulties. I do keep my head down let’s put it that way. As long as I swing slow and keep my head down, I can still hit that ball pretty square.”Mitchell said when he first golfed with Barnes, he expected he would be telling him where his ball went and what he scored on the hole.“Not a chance,” said Mitchell. “He knows his score and mine. He has amazing eyesight and hearing and he never holds up the group. Bruce drives the ball around 150 yards and I have never seen him miss a fairway. I consider him the Moe Norman of Vancouver Island. Barnzie has an incredible short game and chips in regularly and rarely misses a putt inside 10 feet.”Every time he goes out to play, Barnes said he approaches the game one shot at a time.“That’s what I try to do,” said Barnes. “You get ahead of yourself sometimes and when you’re having a really good round and near the end you go ‘oh if just do this I can shoot, like you said, in the 70s. That’s when you screw up. You end up with double bogeys.”READ MORE: Vancouver Island seniors get a kick out of ’walking soccer’Barnes said at his age, there’s going to be aches and pains and he has always turn to golf to make him forget that they’re there.“Whenever I don’t feel well, my wife would tell me to ‘get out there and forget your pains,’” said Barnes. “And it works.

Health Ministry office on Thursday afternoon to sing and speak about the state of extended care for seniors in B.C. and Canada.The Raging Grannies, a satirical grassroots group composed of older women, called for an end to the public funding of for-profit care homes.“COVID-19 has really laid bare the problems in senior care homes. We want to keep it in the public eye [and] hopefully make changes because these are actual people’s homes,” said Charlene Simon during the demonstration.The group practiced physical distancing and wore masks, only removing them to sing songs addressed to B.C.’s Minister of Health Adrian Dix.READ ALSO:Victoria’s Raging Grannies to demonstrate against public funding of for-profit senior homes“Dear mister minister, we can’t see our family or tell the world that it’s worse than jail,” they sang to the tune of Simon & Garfunkel’s Mrs. Robinson. “Please mister minister, check up on those private homes where patients suffer and still pay. Do you want your grandmother begging for a diaper? It doesn’t have to be this way.”At one point, the group put on a skit where some of the women called out for help, with one of them falling out of a wheelchair. Another woman, playing the role of a long-term care home administrator, told them they’d have to wait for care as the doctor is only in once a week or that they’d get their medication when staff had time.“We’re asking for accountability in public reporting and transparency,” Simon said.The demonstration is in response to a February report published by the B.C. Office of the Seniors Advocate. The report, called A Billion Reasons to Care, examined long-term care industry contracts, annual audited financial statements and detailed reporting on revenue and expenditures for the years 2016 to 2017 and 2017 to 2018.Highlights from the review say it found that financial reporting systems were inconsistent between health authorities and that they lacked openness and transparency. It also found that less than half of care home operators are required to make their audited financial statements available to the public and no care homes publicly report their expense statements.READ ALSO:Troops could be called to testify in lawsuits against long-term care homesOverall, the contracted long-term care sector generated $1.4 billion in revenue of which $1.3 billion came from public funding, according to the report. The sector generated a net profit of $37 million.The report says care homes in the not-for-profit sector spent 59 per cent of revenues on direct care versus 49 per cent in the for-profit sector. Not-for-profit care homes spent nine per cent of revenue on building expenses versus 20 per cent in the for-profit sector and for-profit care homes generated 12 times the amount of profit compared to the not-for-profit sector – $34.4 million versus $2.8 million.While receiving, on average, the same level of public funding, the report found that not-for-profit care homes spend $10,000 or 24 per cent more per year on care for each resident while for-profit care homes failed to deliver 207,000 funded direct care hours. Not-for-profit care homes exceeded direct care hour targets by delivering an additional 80,000 hours of direct care beyond what they were publicly funded to deliver.“This issue affects us all,” Simon said. “We have a right to know how that money is being spent. We want assurances that provisions brought in during COVID-19 will continue after.”-With files from Nina Grossmanshalu.mehta@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"
118,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/canadas-proportion-of-covid-longterm-care-deaths-double-that-of-other-countries-study/,"Jun 25, 2020",Canada’s proportion of COVID long-term care deaths double that of other countries: study,"A new study finds the proportion of Canadian COVID-19 deaths that have occurred in long-term care facilities is about twice the average of rates from other developed nations.The analysis released Thursday by the Canadian Institute for Health Information provides a damning snapshot of senior care as of May 25, when LTC residents made up 81 per cent of all reported COVID-19 deaths in the country compared to an average of 42 per cent among all countries studied.The data compares Canada’s record to that of 16 other countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The proportion of LTC deaths ranged from less than 10 per cent in Slovenia and Hungary to 31 per cent in the United States to 66 per cent in Spain.At 5,324, the reported number of LTC deaths in Canada was near the average but data varied widely among countries: from 28 in Australia to 30,000 in the U.S., with more than 10,000 in France, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.Researchers point to limitations that prevent some comparisons — countries vary in COVID-19 testing and reporting practices, and in their definition of long-term care.In addition, COVID-19 cases are often under-reported and in the case of Italy, data was available from only 52 per cent of the nursing homes operating in the country.Nevertheless, Tracy Johnson, CIHI’s director of health systems analysis and emerging issues, says the data offers valuable insight into a tragedy many families, caregivers and residents have been trying to illustrate since the pandemic began.Johnson notes countries that implemented additional LTC precautions at the same time as standard stay-at-home orders had fewer LTC infections and deaths.That includes Australia, Austria and Slovenia, which ordered broad LTC testing and training, isolation wards to manage clusters, surge staffing, specialized teams and personal protective equipment.Johnson says the findings suggest such measures could be key to mitigating the impact of a possible second wave.But for now, she notes several of Canada’s hardest-hit facilities are still grappling with the devastating fallout of existing infections.“Even if all of these (measures are instituted) there will be other folks who will die because some people are infected right now, still, and the outbreaks are still ongoing,” she says.“Some of the control measures though will probably help to at least keep the rates the same as they are.”READ MORE:Canadian Armed Forces members at risk of COVID-19 while on long-term care duty to get extra payThe contrast in LTC deaths is even more stark between provinces and territories, says the report, which notes LTC deaths represented more than 70 per cent of all COVID-19 deaths in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta and 97 per cent of all deaths in Nova Scotia.There were none in Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the territories at the time of the study. Two LTC residents have since died in New Brunswick.Dr. Roger Wong, clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia, says the numbers are “very concerning” and point to long-standing systemic problems that include inadequate staffing and resources and inconsistent standards.“There needs to be a fundamental reprioritization, focusing attention and resources, time and effort into the sector right away. Because I can tell you that what COVID-19 has shown us in terms of a major lesson is a fragmentation (of) seniors’ care,” Wong says from Vancouver.“Which means it makes it more difficult for all of us to support our older Canadians with equal and consistent access to the services that are necessary, based on their care needs at their age.”READ MORE:Liberal MPs call for national standards for long-term care homesWong is part of a federal task force working on national recommendations on how best to help LTC homes battle COVID-19.He says he recently spoke to a Senate standing committee on the topic, drawing on data from June 1 when reports of LTC deaths totalled 6,007, or 82 per cent of deaths.Wong encourages more specific training in geriatric and palliative care as well as psychiatry. And he suggests it’s time to put provincially-driven long-term care mandates under the Canada Health Act.“I see the federal government having its role in terms of setting the national standards and benchmarking so that expectations are set (and) no matter which province or territory our older Canadians are living in they can be protected in the same way under that framework,” says Wong.“(For) individual provinces and territories, it is about implementation of those national, federally set benchmarks and standards.”The CIHI analysis compared Canada to countries that had sufficient data for reporting: Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, the United Kingdom and the United States.Cassandra Szklarski, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

Ask questions if they are acting unusual and trust your instincts if you feel that something is not right.”Discuss oftenReminding the older adults in your life of the importance of not giving out personal or financial information to people you don’t know or over the phone is an important first step.However, by simply opening the financial and fraud prevention dialogue, you build rapport and make it more likely your loved one will reach out to you if there is ever a concern that needs to be addressed.“Having discussions about fraud prevention is an important subject to broach,” Haarhoff said. “Having these conversations early and often could provide the older adults in your life the knowledge they need to identify a potential fraud or scam if they are ever faced with one.”Should you feel someone in your life is being abused or mistreated, contact Seniors First BC via the Seniors Abuse and Information Line (SAIL) toll-free at: 1-866-437-1940.RELATED:LETTER – Get to know your neighbours for World Elder Abuse Awareness DayDo you have something to add to this story, or something else we should report on?Email:jenna.hauck@theprogress.comTwitter:@PhotoJennalismLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

There were also concerns about staff shortages and training.Similar observations were made about the other four Ontario facilities, including bug infestations, aggressive feeding of residents and residents being left crying for hours The Quebec report was less critical, but did raise concerns about staff shortages.None of the allegations in the reports or the proposed lawsuit, which was filed on June 1, have been proven in court.Birman and Jackson are now collecting information to bolster their case for getting the lawsuit certified as a class action, which involves talking to as many residents, family members, staff as well as military personnel as possible.READ MORE:Federal aid for care home systems needed ahead of second wave, advocates sayMilitary spokeswoman Lt. Stephany Lura said military personnel had the same obligation to report to their commanders whatever observations they had while working in the long-term care facilities, as they would with any other mission.“Like any other Canadian, CAF members may be called upon as witnesses,” she added. “This situation is no different. Our members will receive all necessary support from the Department of National Defence and the Canadian Armed Forces should it be needed.”While inviting service members to reach out to them, Birman and Jackson suggested service members could also be compelled to provide eyewitness accounts and other information through affidavits and other procedures.“I would think everybody who’s involved in this important matter would want to hear from the military when this matter makes its way to the courts,” Birman said. “We will do everything we can to gather their evidence so it forms part of the record in this case.”The military had more than 1,000 service members in 15 long-term care facilities in Quebec and almost 500 in five homes in Ontario last week.While officials confirmed Sunday that operations at one of those Ontario homes, Orchard Villa in Pickering, had ended, the military appeared poised to deploy into another home in the city of Vaughan, north of Toronto.“We can confirm that CAF is onsite at Woodbridge Vista today to do an onsite assessment,” said Gillian Sloggett, spokeswoman for Ontario Minister of Long-term Care Merrilee Fullerton.“We are grateful for CAF’s continued support and we will have more news to share about next steps in the coming days.”Talks around the continued provision of service members to long-term care facilities in Quebec until September are underway between Ottawa and the provincial government.— With files from Allison Jones and Salmaan Farooqui in Toronto.Lee Berthiaume, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

So, a quick scramble pulled all the elements together for a great wedding on May 15.“It’s unbelievable to have planned a wedding during a pandemic and within three days while working from 3 a.m. – 3 p.m. on all the days beforehand,” Scheck said.Unfortunately, her stepfather Brian Devlin, 79, passed away May 24 but he after was able to walk his daughter down the aisle.“To our amazement, he was very aware of everything that was going on. And he looked up at me and smiled when they asked who gave me away. I have the pic captured. A very touching moment,” Scheck said.The bride and groom both work at Discovery Harbour Seniors Community which allowed them to hold the wedding on their grounds in the garden. Plus dad was a resident of the centre. A quick set up on the day of the wedding had everything ready to go and all the residents watched out the windows, waving and smiling“My stepdad was wheeled down dressed up and he was coherent the whole time he was present, something he hasn’t been prior to. He talked about fishing and was happy to see his family. He was proud and that’s why we did this on such short notice. It truly was a wonderful moment!”“When we said ‘I do.’ all three floors of the facility were banging on the windows, some were present outside with us, and they all stood at the windows and watched the ceremony with smiles on their faces. We had some fellow co-workers in the crowd cheering us on and taking pics for us.”The happy couple were deeply appreciative of the love and support they receivedIt took a whole host of businesses and people making themselves available on short notice to make it happen. All in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.They ordered their cake through Steiners Bakery, who had it ready for the wedding day, within three days. The couple is so grateful they were open.Justice of the Peace Craig Gillis was available for the big day on a couple days’ notice and they got their wedding license at the Campbell River London Drugs.“I bought my dress off a lady in town here who does photoshoots and had all these amazing brand new dresses for sale. Tags on all. So fortunate as I got it the day before the wedding.”She also purchased a ring for her fiancé at Thongs Jewelry three days before the wedding.“They stayed open so we could be there after work. They sized the ring for us at no cost and had it ready the next day which they again stayed open so we could pick it up. Amazing service.”The bride was overjoyed that it all came together in time so her father could be there.“This is a story of love and also a story of the great community we live in,” Scheck said.RELATED:Couple celebrates 61st anniversary through Vancouver Island seniors’ home windowRELATED:Sisters surprised to find themselves reunited at Nanaimo seniors care home after years apart@AlstrTeditor@campbellrivermirror.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

Minister of Health Adrian Dix added in the press release that he strongly supports the health authority’s decision and said “we will continue to put the care and safety of seniors first before any other consideration.”Nanaimo Seniors Village, a 150-bed long-term care facility, is owned by Retirement Concepts and operated by Pacific Reach Seniors Housing Management.Island Health’s decision last fall to put the facility under administration came after numerous “routine and complaint-based inspections,” the health authority said at the time, and a “repeated noted deficiency” in staffing levels.READ ALSO:Health authority takes next step, puts Nanaimo seniors home under administrationREAD ALSO:Island Health helping ‘stabilize’ Nanaimo Seniors Village through staffing shortageeditor@nanaimobulletin.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

The other occurred in North Vancouver’s Lynn Valley Care Centre and started in March. That outbreak end with 76 people, including 52 elderly residents and 26 staff at the care home being diagnosed with COVID. Twenty of the residents died.In the latest report from Langley Lodge issued late this morning, there were now 21 active cases among residents, eight among staff, and zero new cases, with still six recovered.“There have been more deaths since yesterday (May 20); sadly, three of our residents who were positive for COVID-19,” the Lodge’s CEO Debra Hauptman postedonlineyesterday.“Our staff are saddened by the loss of these residents and we extend our sincere condolences to the families. We acknowledge the challenging time we are in and the impact of this loss on the families of our residents,” she added.The Lodge received news Wednesday that a healthcare worker from FHA, who came to assist with the outbreak, tested positive for COVID-19. The healthcare worker worked on a unit where they have not had any cases to date.And while the worker wore wearing personal protective equipment and had minimal contact with residents, the Lodge has had to upgrade outbreak measures, including confining residents to their rooms.All residents and families have been informed of “the unfortunate development” by the CEO and medical director Dr. Mitchell Fagan.“We will be monitoring the residents closely and we hope to get through this latest development without any further cases,” Hauptman said in her online update.The virus was introduced into their dementia unit by an infected worker on April 27.“There are 26 frail elderly residents in this unit who also have advanced dementia. Due to their cognitive impairment these residents are not able to understand social distancing to prevent the spread of infection. Normally, residents with advanced dementia are very mobile, actively touching surfaces in their unit,” she said.“This situation presented a unique set of challenges for infection control, combined with a highly contagious strain of this virus introduced into a high-risk population,” Hauptman said.She’s often being asked if there is anything that they need.“All of us in Langley Lodge are very appreciative of the kind messages that families have been sending to us. Our staff are working tremendously hard under difficult circumstances to care for loved ones. Please continue to support our staff with your messages of encouragement and compassion. And to quote Dr. Bonnie Henry, ‘be kind, be calm, and be safe’,” Hauptman concluded._________________________________Is there more to this story?Email:news@langleyadvancetimes.comLike us onFacebookor follow us onTwitter_________________________________CoronavirusHealthLangleySeniors"

According to Ottawa, there are 7.6 million seniors eligible for the OAS payment and 2.2 million eligible for the GIS one.“There’s no doubt that COVID-19 has been taking its toll on seniors both emotionally and financially,” Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said at during his daily address at Rideau Cottage.He talked about seniors in longterm care homes who have born the brunt of the pandemic. Data released by the Public Health Agency of Canada at the end of April found that 95 per cent of deaths are in people aged 60 or older, while 79 per cent of deaths are linked to longterm care homes.“There are serious underlying challenges facing these facilities,” he said.Ottawa said it will spend $20 million to top up the New Horizons for Seniors Program to support organizations that offer community-based projects to reduced isolation, help seniors to maintain a social support network and improve quality of life.Tuesday’s announcement comes on top of a GST payment of $375 for single seniors and $510 for senior couples announced earlier this spring.READ MORE:Canada predicts 3,800 total deaths by early May, as COVID-19 spreads in vulnerable groups@katslepiankatya.slepian@bpdigital.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

But we learned from that,” Henry said.Authorities took a “swat team approach” to the outbreak with measures that included “very sensitive surveillance” and testing, Henry told a recent news conference.Outbreaks have been declared in 34 facilities in B.C. since the start of the pandemic, but more than half of those long-term care homes no longer have any cases.Henry said those outbreaks have been responsible for the majority of the deaths in the province.Over 400 residents and staff at B.C. care homes have tested positive for the virus. Vancouver Coastal Health has had 14 outbreaks in long-term homes and two in acute care facilities.READ MORE:B.C. will ‘have to find a way’ for families to visit seniors in longterm care: advocateJust as infections began in B.C.’s care homes, care facilities for seniors in Ontario and Quebec were also being ravaged by the new coronavirus causing a large proportion of the country’s now more than 4,400 deaths.About 80 per cent of Quebec’s pandemic deaths have occurred at long-term care and seniors residences that have been infected with the novel coronavirus.More than 1,200 cases of COVID-19 have been diagnosed among residents in Ontario care homes, which account for about half the 478 known deaths.Schwandt said Vancouver Coastal Health learned from the experiences of Quebec and Ontario and what they were seeing in outbreaks internationally.“In a couple of outbreaks, we’ve tested all the staff regardless of symptoms and we have found people who had no symptoms at all and later became ill with COVID-19,” he said.Staff started extensive use of personal protective equipment, visits were cut off and those diagnosed were isolated.Then they began testing for the virus around the facilities.“In some cases, they found COVID-19 to contaminate equipment or parts of the facility … equipment carts or blood pressure cups,” he said. ”The building itself is of high quality but the risk of contamination within buildings with COVID-19 is something we’ve been learning more about.”The buildings were deep cleaned depending on the specific facility, equipment and how much traffic they saw, he said.Schwandt said he recommends “very proactive” testing within facilities and cautious tracing of known cases.“Even a small amount of contact, we have found, can lead to a transmission between residents and staff and so it’s important to look very closely at even limited contact and monitor them for symptoms.”READ MORE:No easy fix for long-term care, but it starts with working conditions: expertsAnd while the risk of illness from the new coronavirus does seem to be more serious among seniors, Schwandt said several of them have recovered.Dr. Roger Wong, a clinical professor of geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia’s faculty of medicine, said the pandemic has unmasked a number of serious issues faced by long-term care facilities.Not only do the care facilities need to address infection prevention and control but also underlying physical- and mental-health conditions, he said.“Those seniors who have more severe form of dementia, they are definitely at higher risk of COVID-19,” Wong said.Alzheimer’s patients tend to wander and might become infected in their travel through the facility, he said.While measures such as testing, tracing, extensive use of personal protective equipment and cleaning can help combat the spread of the virus, Wong said a “paradigm shift in the underlying culture and understanding and value of these homes” is required to help control future infections.He said these aren’t just facilities for seniors, they are their homes.“That understanding will drive further change.”Hina Alam, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter.Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

In a community action plan assessment report on Tahsis, from October 2019, 76 per cent of the residents were identified as above 55 years of age with the average age of a Tahsis resident being 58.The report identified transportation as one of the top markers of dissatisfaction, which was over 60 per cent, among its senior residents.With a small economy and limited medical resources, residents travel over 150 kilometres to Campbell River for medical check-ups and consultations with specialists. Pharmacies are accessible at Gold River which is a 65 kilometre drive.To add to that, the road conditions with long stretches that are unpaved, don’t help either, said the mayor.“We have been struggling to get the roads improved and most seniors don’t have four wheel drives,” said Davis, adding that some residents don’t even have vehicles to travel such a distance.However, the community’s “strong social fabric” keeps things running with volunteers helping out seniors in the community, said Davis.Last week, when Tahsis faced a 36-hour power cut due to a logging company accident, the community volunteered to help. The village opened up the recreation centre, supplied power, meals and drinks for the seniors in the community.Although there are two caregivers who visit the more vulnerable seniors in Tahsis, these seniors have to leave Tahsis once they need constant care.“Many of them would prefer to live back at home in Tahsis,’ said Davis and added that limited facilities in the village makes it difficult for them to stay back.Last year at the Comox- Strathcona Regional Health Board meeting, the mayor advocated for help with establishing a senior’s assisted living home in Tahsis.Since then, the mayor said that they have been researching options, which could range from an extension to the clinic, a stand-alone home or just enhancing home care for seniors who want to remain in their homes when possible.READ AlSO:Island mayor confident of small community’s ‘resilience’ in ‘trial’READ ALSO: Tahsis ‘all in’ on social distancing, so village asks you to stay outLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

Like many retirement communities, Magnolia Gardens has a tablet designated for resident use, and staff are happy to facilitate chats between residents and their loved ones.• Send flowers to brighten her day and her suite. As a bonus, you’ll be supporting local businesses.• Posters and artwork posted on lounge windows bring joy to her and to the other residents who see it.• Deliver a care package that has cards or gift items to open each day to remind Mom that you’re thinking about her.Murphy said she will miss celebrating with her family this year.Still, she’s hopeful for next year.“I’m taking to heart what Muriel, one of our residents, wrote to her family this year, “this too shall pass’.”_________________________________Is there more to this story?Email:ryan.uytdewilligen@langleyadvancetimes.comLike us onFacebookor follow us onTwitter_________________________________CoronavirusLangleySeniors"
134,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/lawsuits-over-covid-19-handling-in-nursing-homes-raise-questions-about-standard-of-care/,"May 3, 2020",Lawsuits over COVID-19 handling in nursing homes raise questions about standard of care,"As the deadly toll of COVID-19 on Canada’s nursing homes gives rise to a growing number of proposed class-action lawsuits, some legal experts say the cases will turn on what’s considered reasonable care during a pandemic.The ongoing global health crisis that has disproportionately affected the elderly poses a unique and unprecedented backdrop for such civil actions, which have emerged in Ontario and Quebec in recent weeks, experts say.While nursing homes can’t be blamed for the pandemic, they can be held accountable for unnecessary and preventable deaths, said Michael Smitiuch, a Toronto-based lawyer who previously led a successful negligence lawsuit against a Brampton, Ont. facility for seniors.“A crisis like this does not give nursing homes a free pass to neglect the elderly. So I think what will happen is…we’re going to look back at this through a lens of what was reasonable under the circumstances,” he said.“The interesting question will be, what is the standard of care during a pandemic?”The courts will likely look to the requirements and guidelines issued by health ministries, the World Health Organization and other similar bodies in gauging whether any defendants were negligent, Smitiuch said.READ MORE:B.C. will ‘have to find a way’ for families to visit seniors in longterm care: advocateThe novel coronavirus has ravaged private and government-run seniors’ homes, particularly in Canada’s two largest provinces, causing a large proportion of the country’s more than 3,000 deaths.Rules and standards for nursing homes have evolved rapidly as public health officials respond to the crisis, with several provinces now banning staff from working in multiple facilities.However, a number of proposed class-action lawsuits allege negligence on the part of governments or nursing home operators in their handling of the virus.In Quebec, the son of a 94-year-old woman who died of COVID-19 at one of the province’s hardest-hit facilities has filed a class-action application against the government-run CHSLD Ste-Dorothee.A Toronto law firm, meanwhile, has served the provincial government with notice of a proposed class proceeding on behalf of all Ontarians in long-term care homes.It alleges the province’s failures in overseeing the facilities have resulted in widespread, avoidable illness and death during the pandemic.Another such lawsuit launched by two Ontario men whose mothers died from COVID-19 targets Revera, a privately owned nursing home company.None of the cases have been certified as class actions so far and their claims have not been tested in court.Scott Stanley, a personal injury lawyer in Vancouver, said these lawsuits and any others that surface in the coming months will face multiple hurdles in meeting the criteria for negligence.First, he said, it may be difficult for plaintiffs to show the actions of the operators or government caused the deaths.“If the theory is, well, workers were able to go from one home to the other and transmit the virus — that’s a theory, but you have to show factually that that actually caused other people to be affected or infected,” he said.It may also be challenging to demonstrate that the care given fell below established standards, particularly when suing governments, since they are measured against the standards they created, Stanley said.Governments could also introduce legislation to protect themselves against COVID-19 related lawsuits, although there is a “very live debate” over whether they can preclude cases involving breaches of charter rights, he said.Such laws are generally “very unpopular” politically, he said.Even if any of the proposed class actions are successful, plaintiffs may be shocked to find the damages they receive are minimal, he said.“People are not compensated for the loss of companionship, the loss of friendship, from an older person that’s deceased,” he said.“You’re basically compensating for the loss of economic benefits they brought to you. And most older people are not in a position where they’re providing economic benefits…so in many instances those claims are actually worth nothing.”In truly egregious cases, a nursing home could face punitive damages, which are meant to deter certain conduct, said Smitiuch, the Toronto lawyer.Governments should also consider an inquiry into how care homes responded to the crisis, he said.“It would be something that would be valuable for the future, because no doubt we’ll be facing something like this sometime in the future,” he said.Three professional orders in Quebec have said they will hold a joint investigation into the situation at seniors’ homes and long-term care centres since the COVID-19 pandemic struck.Paola Loriggio, The Canadian PressLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."
135,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/broken-hip-and-covid-keep-b-c-couple-apart-for-76th-anniversary/,"Apr 30, 2020",Broken hip and COVID keep B.C. couple apart for 76th anniversary,"Ninety-five-year-old Violet Kosinski is hobbling around a ward at Ridge Meadows Hospital, after breaking her hip last week.Meanwhile, her 98-year-old husband, Roy, is going a little stir crazy in their 600-square-foot room at the Wesbrooke retirement home in Pitt Meadows – confined, as a precaution, due to the coronavirus.The pair hadn’t been planning any big celebration for their 76th wedding anniversary yesterday (April 29), but they had at least expected to spend it together.Now, the couple must be content to mark the anniversary of their wartime nuptials via FaceTime – a technology not surprisingly foreign to the elderly pair, explained their daughter Barb Serr.“You couldn’t get more complicated if we tried,” Serr said, eternally grateful to the nursing staff at both health care facility and the social support workers who are going to be helping make this couple’s connection on Wednesday possible.“They haven’t seen each other for a week, and Dad is very concerned and anxious to know that Mom is really okay,” said the eldest of two Kosinski siblings. “He needs to see for himself.”Initially, the hope was to have a large family dinner to mark their anniversary. The couple has two children, six grandchildren, eight great grandchildren, and now a great-great grandchild.But, with the arrival of COVID and the necessity for self-isolating, that became impossible. Maybe, Serr said, a family gathering can be planned once the dangers of the pandemic are quelled.Asked what it’s like to celebrate such a milestone anniversary, Violet said: “We celebrated so many of them, it doesn’t seem like anything different.”But admittedly, this one is very different, Serr interjected, since they won’t be able to actually celebrate together.This couple was married in Winnipeg in 1944, six months after they met at a community barn dance that Violet admittedly didn’t even want to attend.As if it was yesterday, Violet recounted how she came in and spotted a Canadian air force mechanic huddled by the woodstove trying to stay warm. He captivated her and the rest was history.“I looked over, and he looked over, and that was it… We danced for the rest of the night,” Violet said.Reflecting back on their life together, and what got them through, both agree “a good sense of humour,” has been essential.“Nobody can live that long without an argument once in a while,” Roy added. “But, you get over that and carry on.”Their lengthy love story continues to inspire Serr.“They have been through polio, Scarlett fever, the Second World War – of which dad is a veteran – and now this. Still able to laugh, tell a joke, and of course [share] so many wonderful stories,” Serr said. “It’s quite something to be together for 76 years… This is a wonderful story of love and sorrow and always a shining smile through their life adventures.”SIMILAR MILESTONE: B.C. grandpa beats heart attack amid COVID-19 to celebrate 71st wedding anniversary.• If there is more to this story, please let us know about it.

And their activities, outings and respite care have been mostly taken away by isolation restrictions imposed to prevent the spread of COVID-19.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie says the province has fewer options for direct support, but it is reaching out virtually with a toll-free help line at 1-877-520-3267, and a new website, familycaregiversBC.cato provide support. The province has provided an additional $500,000 to the Family Caregivers of B.C. to better connect people who are taking care of elderly relatives.“I know the help you really need right now is some relief from your caregiving duties, and some time for yourself,” Mackenzie said April 26. “That’s incredibly challenging to provide for you right now. But you may find some comfort, if you can share your burden with those who understand it best. Please call Family Caregivers of BC directly, or connect through 2-1-1 and allow them to help.”Since March, B.C.’s 2-1-1 line and its websitebc211.cahave been connecting the thousands of volunteers offering meal and medicine deliveries or friendly virtual visits for seniors isolated in the pandemic. In the first four weeks, it has delivered more than 12,000 virtual visits, nearly 3,000 grocery deliveries and 2,800 meals.RELATED:B.C.’s 2-1-1 hotline expands to link seniors, volunteersRELATED:Respite care, adult day programs expanded in 2018“There are over 5,500 British Columbians who have volunteered so far,” Mackenzie said. “It grows every day. I see selfless acts of kindness being extended to seniors in every neighbourhood of this province.”Even self-sufficient seniors currently don’t have the option of visiting activity centres or libraries, where some were getting internet service.Providing adequate, affordable home care has long been a struggle for the province, and the pandemic has aggravated that problem with the suspension of day programs. She urged people to use 2-1-1 or the new support line for advice and assistance.“Others might receive respite from a care worker who comes into their home and allows the family member to get out, run errands, and be out and about in the community and get some relief,” Mackenzie said. “Now, with COVID-19, we’re finding that some families are cancelling some, or all, of their home respite in order to control the number of people that are coming into the home.”Provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry said home medical and care visits are being managed differently than senior care facilities, where visitors are strictly limited.“There is guidance that we’ve provided for home support and for home care, nurses that go into the home to provide support as well,” Henry said in her daily briefing April 23. “It involves things like minimizing the people in the room.“If you have to provide direct support, making sure that you have the appropriate tools to do it safely, making sure that you can clean your hands, that you can wear gloves, if necessary, and masks, if necessary. But also, recognizing that we don’t want you having contact with all the other family members that might be in the home.”@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

Henry asked all assisted living facilities to allow “essential visits only,” which has led to a stoppage of family visits.Hundreds of staff and seniors at longterm care facilities have been infected with the virus, leading to many of B.C.’s 100 deaths. There are currently outbreaks at 19 facilities, with outbreaks at a further 10 homes being declared over. Speaking last week, Henry said seniors in longterm careare offered the “full spectrum of care,”but most do not opt for hospitalization when they get the virus.On Sunday, Mackenzie said spouses and children must be able to see their loved ones in longterm care. She said that amid B.C.’s “new normal,” the assisted living sector will need to figure out “some form of visits from family members,” before a vaccine is developed – which could be as much as a year away.She noted that Henry’s guidance did specifically allow for some visits, including for compassionate and palliative care, and to assist with feeding and mobility.“I am going to be communicating to the care homes to carefully look at that language and make accommodations where they can.”Mackenzie acknowledged the visits will be highly restricted and may not be possible at all facilities.“If there is an active outbreak of COVID-19 in the care home that makes it more difficult,” she said.“People going a year or more without seeing their spouse… is tragic.”Mackenzie said family members not only support their loved one in the care home but also to be the “eyes that see and the ears that hear” to ensure care is up to standards.READ MORE:‘You are not alone’: B.C. pledges $500K to help family caregivers amid COVID-19 pandemicREAD MORE:B.C. care home site of virus recovery study, Bonnie Henry saysREAD MORE:B.C.’s senior home staff measures show results in COVID-19 battle@katslepiankatya.slepian@bpdigital.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

Mackenzie said in the past four week, the program has led to 12,193 virtual visits, 2,957 grocery deliveries and 2,782 meals.Amid recorded spikes in domestic violence calls due to isolation, Mackenzie said her officer has not seen an increase in calls about elder abuse at this time.READ MORE:Wheelchair contraption reconnects South Surrey seniors – from a distanceREAD MORE:Canada’s top doctor says measures ‘starting to pay off’, even as COVID-19 deaths near 2,500Like us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

Shifting demographics — the so-called silver tsunami — helped inspire the movement, but its broader vision has been to improve quality of life overall. B.C. is a recognized leader with more than 40 communities recognized so far.Age-friendly communities allow people to remain as independent as possible for as long as possible, said Cherie Enns, planning consultant.“It’s important to note this is a global initiative and it speaks to community,” Enns said. “There are so many times that place is excluded for us due to age.”Last year, for the first time, people over 65 outnumbered those age 14 and younger, she noted.The World Health Organization recognizes eight “domains of age-friendliness.” These include safe, accessible environments (indoors and outdoors), transportation, housing, social inclusiveness, support and health services. This calls for an integration of all aspects of community, Enns said.“There are just so many ways we can rethink community and how we can remain active at all levels,” Enns said.Anaka offered a snapshot of electoral area age composition. With a median age of 47, 30 percent are between 45 and 64, the largest age group. Average life expectancy is 79. More significantly, over the next 20 years, the number of residents aged 75 and over is expected to double, she said.RELATED: Island grocery stores dedicate early hours to seniors, health-compromised shoppersWhile the ACRD plan is focused on rural areas, city and valley are closely linked: “Really, it’s a plan for the entire valley,” Anaka said.“There’s already been a lot of age-friendly work done locally and we’re going to make sure we work off that,” she added. Planning revolves around the ACRD zoning bylaw, official community plan, agricultural plan and emergency plan as well as parks and trails.A resident survey this winter year yielded direct feedback. Among common concerns, accessibility and transportation alternatives were prominent. Safe cycling is limited within the rural areas.“A lot of people commented on Beaver Creek Road in particular,” Anaka said.Health concerns include a chronic shortage of physicians and a single walk-in clinic. Respondents also showed strong interest in growing their own food.“We need many more farmers growing food locally and programs to help people access that food.”For more news from the Island and beyond delivered directly to your email inbox,click hereMunicipal GovernmentPORT ALBERNISeniors"

Zessel said although she misses going for lunches and drives with her daughter, she’s managing to stay busy.“The girls here are wonderful, they laugh and they giggle and they tell jokes and it’s not a gloom and doom atmosphere,” she said, about the staff at Stanford. “I hope for the best, that’s all, and we miss our programs that we have — people don’t know what to do with themselves.”Robillard worked in retirement homes and communities for 40 years and said she worries about the high number of seniors in the Parksville Qualicum Beach Area.

Last week they found it.One of Ivy’s sons, Pat Deakin, also the economic development manager for the City of Port Alberni, has been working with local entrepreneur Kevin Wright to produce face shields for health-care workers in the Alberni Valley. Wright owns several three-dimensional (3-D) printers and has switched over from making keychains, signs and other objects.READ: 3-D printer provided PPE for West Coast General HospitalThe Deakins have paid for 200 face shields to be distributed among staff at Fir Park Village and Echo Village seniors’ long-term care homes.“We really appreciated what the staff there did for her,” Pat Deakin said.“We’ve been looking for a good way of saying thanks. We’ve had conversations about a piece of equipment or a bench or bursary. This presented a great opportunity to say thanks.”The Deakin family paid for the cost of materials for the 200 face shields, made a contribution toward Wright’s time and also contributed to the amortization of the printers’ cost (the City of Port Alberni purchased 10 more printers to help Wright meet demand).“It finally gives us the opportunity to say thanks in a really meaningful way,” he said.There was also some familial synchronicity in the decision: Ivy Deakin was good friends with Bertha Castelyns, who still lives at Echo Village. Castelyns’ daughter is Toosha Houle, and Toosha’s husband Denis is helping produce the face shields.“It’s all exciting when it all comes together,” said Toosha.The donation of face shields is a welcome gift, says Joe McQuaid, executive director of the Alberni-Clayoquot Continuing Care Society. McQuaid oversees both Fir Park Village and Echo Village.“Part of the challenge in the coming months is going to be on PPEs, making sure we have enough,” he said. “This is not an easy thing to fight.”Community donations will go a long way to helping healthcare workers in long-term care facilities keep their clients safe, he added.“That sort of generosity that’s playing out, we’re fortunate the community is so thoughtful and benevolent. It’s that type of community effort that’s going to get us through this.”susie.quinn@albernivalleynews.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

Staff made sure that Clara made Mary’s acquaintance.“The first thing Clara did was pinch Mary, 89, really hard,” said Sandy Parise, Eden Gardens’ executive assistant, in the release. “Mary yelped and Clara responded with, ‘I thought you were dead.’”The sisters, who had lost contact with one another six years earlier, couldn’t believe who they were seeing, Parise said, and spent the next several hours that day, and many more since, laughing together and talking a mile a minute while reminiscing.READ ALSO:Compassion and enthusiasm are at the centre of Eden Gardens’ approach to dementia careBill Newman, the sisters’ younger brother who lives on the Sunshine Coast, said the sisters lost touch after Clara had suffered a stroke and developed difficulties with comprehension. She lived in the Duncan area before requiring greater care, and Bill arranged for her to move into Eden Gardens.“She didn’t really know quite what was going on. I’ll put it that way,” Bill said, in a phone interview with the News Bulletin. “She didn’t quite understand what people were saying and she thought Mary didn’t want her to phone her again or see her again and that’s why they didn’t see one another, but it was just a total misunderstanding between the two of them.”Bill said Clara has mostly recovered from the effects of the stroke.He said his sisters have been reminiscing about growing up in Sansum Narrows, south of Maple Bay. They come from a large family of six sisters and five brothers and lived on a houseboat – named the ‘El Rose’ after their mother – until about 1948.“My grandfather used to sell mine props to the mines at Nanaimo and Mom and her sisters and brothers, they logged them, with horses … and they had to walk to Genoa Bay. Seven miles to work and then seven miles back and then they logged the poles during the day.”Some of the memories recalled at the sisters’ first meeting had the women laughing so hard they both had tears running down their cheeks.“Clara told us that Mary was always Daddy’s favourite,” Parise said. “It was so amusing to see Mary having so much fun.

They leave the supplies on the front step, ring the bell and be on their way.“We’re gloved 100 per cent of the time because we are in a business where we are basically washing our hands all the time anyway. We understand the necessity of that cleaning,” Strong said.The idea was posted on social media and it has “taken off” right across the country. Strong estimates that the Campbell River crew could accommodate one or two people a day.Strong said it is done strictly on a volunteer basis by his employees, he has eight up and down the Island.“I haven’t had one per who said no,” Strong said.They’re willing to go and buy the “necessities of life” for people. They’re not going to go and buy a game for someone or six flats of beer. But on the other hand, one person asked them to pick up a bottle of wine and Strong said, “No problem.”“trying to keep life comfortable,” is the aim, Strong said.The motivation for the services is straightforward.“We just want to help our community as much as possible during this time. If there is anything we do to help, just reach out,” Strong said.If you’d like some help with the groceries, email: jmarshall@meninkilts.com.Men In Kilts provides commercial window and building exterior washing services and uses a distinctive green tartan theme as their corporate colours and their staff wear green tartan kilts.CoronavirusSeniorsCampbell River Men In Kilts franchise owner Chris Strong has a list of groceries in hand that he will buy on behalf of a local resident unable to get out and pick up their own groceries.

Specifically, a cloth bag filled with wheat husks and sewn tight, so that it can be warmed in a microwave oven and used over and over for comfort.Ruth is now sharing her story about a house fire that she says began with the heating of one of these packs.Read about COVID:IH makes changes to protect seniors receiving careIt was the morning of March 11, and her day started out like any other.She rose early, had a bite to eat, and a little later, the 81-year old decided to lie down and watch T.V., maybe even catch a little shut-eye.First, Ruth warmed up her heat pack in the microwave – she calls it her “bean bag” – then put it on her feet, and settled in on her chesterfield for a rest.Next thing she remembers is being woken up by the clanging of the recycling truck in the back alley, after all it was her garbage pickup and recycle day.But when she opened her eyes, her quaint East Trail home was filled with smoke and thick with the acrid smell of something burning.Luckily, Ruth’s couch was very close to the back door. Feeling slightly off-kilter, all she could think of doing was opening up the door to let some air in, and get herself more oriented.Once she did that, however, the breath of fresh air – full of oxygen – was so forceful that Ruth was blown back in a whoosh and the couch instantly ignited in flames as high as five feet.Meanwhile, in the seconds this all took to happen, the Alpine recycling worker smelled smoke, glanced around, and saw Ruth’s face at the door and the flicker of flames behind her.He ran up to the house, helped her outside, then quickly pulled the foam cushions off the couch and dragged them into the backyard. His quick thinking saved Ruth and likely saved her entire house from going up in a blaze.“If it wasn’t for the garbage man making noise out there I wouldn’t be here,” Ruth told theTrail Times. “Even the front of my housecoat was singed. I couldn’t breathe very good and the back room was full of smoke,”she recounted. “So if it wasn’t for him, he helped me get out, I wouldn’t be here today.”The Alpine worker also called 9-1-1, and that report went into the regional fire hall just before 10:15 a.m. that Wednesday morning.BC Ambulance was called to the scene as well, and Ruth was transported to the hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation.She is still shaken, and since the terrifying ordeal, Ruth has been recovering at her son’s home in the Okanagan.“Thirty seconds more, or if the recycling man wasn’t there when she opened the door, it would be a different story,” her son, Chris Kaspick, told the Times.“Because her housecoat was already on fire, it was singed at the bottom, it was that close.”With his mom settled in safe and at his side, Chris has been taking care of the business end of things, such as calling the insurance company and getting the house restored from smoke damage.With the dust settled and residual shock starting to ease, Chris called theTrail Timesfrom his Okanagan home to pass on what happened.“After years of use, the husks in those bags can breakdown and become quite flammable,” he said. “And then, when it’s heated up and put on a couch that is made of foam, that becomes very flammable – it just smoldered while she was sleeping,” Chris explained. “So when the Alpine truck woke her up … and she cracked the back door open, as soon as the oxygen got it, it blew her back a bit and the oxygen set the fire.”Before sharing this story with theTimes, Chris had an even more important call to make, and that was to Alpine Disposal.He had to thank the man who saved his mother and try to get this worker some sort of commendation, or at least some well-deserved recognition for his life-saving actions.As the old saying goes, “Not All Heroes Wear Capes.”“He’s a humble guy and said he just wants to be known as the recycle guy who helped out, and he doesn’t want his name out,” Chris said, his own voice cracking with emotion.“All he said is, ‘if it was my mom, I wish somebody would do the same thing for her.’”As Ruth readies to return home, one thing is clear, the terrifying experience did not steal her sense of humour.Most of all, she wanted to warn others that these heat packs can become a fire hazard.But Ruth also had one last thing to say.“Now that I know, I’ll just get an electric one,” she quipped.newsroom@trailtimes.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

The challenge, however, is when you have older people who are at risk of social isolation — it’s very upsetting for them to be in isolation in many instances. And if you have people with cognitive impairment, they may not understand why no one is coming to visit them.”Ontario’s health ministry said Monday it was introducing “active surveillance” in which staff, volunteers, visitors and residents who come and go would be screened for symptoms and asked about travel history.In addition, any specimens sent for standard respiratory testing will automatically be tested for COVID-19, said a provincial memo to the long-term care homes sector.Chief medical officer of health Dr. David Williams stressed the need for the general public to take precautions that include washing hands frequently to protect the most vulnerable residents.“If people are casual about their travel protection, casual about their contact protection and are less than vigilant on staying home when they’re ill and that kind of thing, then we can put that population at risk,” he said.“By being vigilant, by keeping at that, you can protect them.”VIDEO:B.C. records first COVID-19 death in Canada as province hits 32 casesDoris Grinspun, chief executive officer of the Registered Nurses’ Association of Ontario, said Tuesday that she wanted assurances from the province that retirement homes would be held to the same guidelines.“It is my understanding from the ministry that they meant this to be also for retirement homes and we have asked that to be in writing,” said Grinspun.She also repeated her organization’s call for increased nursing-home staff, noting each facility typically has just one or two registered nurses, and three registered practical nurses.“The rest — 75 per cent of our workforce in nursing homes — are personal support workers (and) as much as they try to do what they can do, they don’t have the same expertise and knowledge and training as RNs or RPNs. And then on top of that, we don’t have the right numbers in terms of each one of these categories of workers,” said Grinspun.“Nursing homes are extremely strained as we speak, and have been for years and years and years.”In Nova Scotia, the province’s chief medical officer of health drew attention to new national screening protocols for the novel coronavirus and stressed that those who travel out-of-country monitor themselves for two weeks.Dr. Robert Strang also announced that nursing home visitors who have travelled outside the country in the last 14 days would not be allowed entry, a measure the president of the Nova Scotia Nurses’ Union doubted could be monitored or enforced.“I wouldn’t see that as the role of the nursing staff,” says Janet Hazelton, who instead called for guidance on what to do if a resident contracts COVID-19.“We don’t have the staff in long-term care that we have in acute care. We don’t have the cleaning staff… We have no security. So if security was more who they thought would police this, there is no in security long-term care.”There are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Nova Scotia.In British Columbia, provincial health officer Dr. Bonnie Henry says people should continue seeing their loved ones in nursing homes, but must take preventative measures.“We want to have enhanced screening of visitors who are coming in and out of long-term care (homes) so if you are going to visit someone don’t go with a large group, go one by one. Only go to visit the person you are there to see.

Assisted living is a type of supportive housing for people with moderate levels of disability who can direct their own care but need daily personal assistance in order to live independently, such as help getting dressed and bathing or assistance taking medications.Average annual rents for those private units range from just over $24,000 for an assisted living bachelor suite to more than $36,000 for a one bedroom, plus a myriad of additional fees for extra services and supplies not included in the basic monthly charge, according to report author Andrew Longhurst.Meanwhile, the median income for a single senior in the province is roughly $27,600.“Without access to subsidized assisted living, seniors who can’t afford to pay privately may go without care altogether or wait until their health deteriorates to the point of requiring a nursing home or hospitalization,” Longhurst said in a news release Wednesday.ALSO READ:Union pleas for province to act on nursing home takeover by Chinese government“This situation does not serve seniors or our public health care system well at all.”When compared to the growing population of seniors aged 75 years and older in B.C., the province saw a 17 per cent drop in the number of subsidized assisted living units between 2008 and 2017.In 2008, there were 4,393 publicly subsidized units for slightly more than 298,000 seniors in the province, or a rate of 14.7 per 1,000 seniors. But by 2017, according to the report, there were 4,485 units for roughly 367,000 seniors – a rate of 12.2.Region-by-region, four of the five health authorities saw declines during this time, including Vancouver Coastal Health (25 per cent decline), Fraser Health (19 per cent decline), Vancouver Island Health (17 per cent decline) and Interior Health (11 per cent decline).Vancouver Coastal Health had the lowest level of access with just 10 units per 1,000 seniors. Meanwhile, Northern Health saw a marginal increase in the number of units, at five per cent.Longhurst said another key concern is the rise in international companies owning seniors’ care facilities. Currently, the provincial government does not limit how much private operators can charge.“Allowing assisted living facilities to be treated as financial commodities is at odds with the basic social purpose of providing care to vulnerable seniors,” he said.“The absence of public capital investments to enable health authorities and non-profits to develop new spaces means very few new publicly subsidized assisted living facilities are being built. The private-pay market has benefited as a result.”The Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives’s report makes two recommendations to the province: Increase government funding to open more assisted living units and implement detailed, public disclosure of all assisted living units including the cost, ownership and quality of services.The province is expected to unveil their next budget later this month.

For-profit care homes “failed to deliver 207,000 funded direct care home hours” during the survey period, while not-for-profit operators “exceeded direct care hour targets by delivering an additional 80,000 hours of direct care beyond what they were publicly funded to deliver,” the report finds.The report says the difference in spending is partly due to care aide wages in for-profit care homes, where they can be paid as much as 28 per cent or $6.63 per hour less than the industry standard.RELATED:B.C. seniors need better vaccine protection, advocate saysRELATED:Seniors Advocate finds holes in B.C. home supportBringing care home delivery hours up to the province’s own standard has been a major focus for Dix, along with expanding care provided directly by regional health authorities.Currently 33 per cent of publicly funded long-term care beds are operated by B.C.’s regional health authorities.

The company is also responsible for the two other facilities that Island Health took over: the Comox Valley Seniors Village in Courtenay, which Island Health took over on Sept. 30 and the Nanaimo Seniors Village on Nov. 27.South Island Medical Health Officer Dr. Murray Fyfe recommended the switch after studying a detailed report by Island Health’s Community Care Facilities Licensing Program. The report came forward after a thorough review following several complaints.READ MORE:Island Health to staff Selkirk Place seniors residence in VictoriaIsland Health tried to intervene with the issues before taking over; in October it provided staff members to the Selkirk to bolster what was available.

We also support any initiatives the government may undertake to address the broader labour shortage, which has been well documented by the BC Care Providers Association.”Presently, staff retention has been an issue at Retirement Concepts since wages are lower for staff than those available at unionized branches under Island Health.“We acknowledge that wage parity is a factor on our ability to recruit and maintain staff, and we are attempting to work with our unions to close that gap,” Deneca said. “We also acknowledge that these issues are having an impact on our ability to meet all compliance standards.”nicole.crescenzi@vicnews.comLike us onFacebookSend aTweet to @NicoleCrescenziand follow us onInstagramIsland HealthSeniorsseniors housing"

Some advocates say Canada should adopt a Silver Alerts system similar to that used in the U.S.Support for a national system has been building over the last decade. Such a system would be similar to the Amber Alert system but for missing and vulnerable adults, particularly seniors with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia. The idea is to involve as many community members as possible so vulnerable missing seniors can be located more quickly.READ MORE:UPDATED: Missing 84-year-old Saanich man with Alzheimer’s found in EsquimaltAdvocates for this kind of system, such as Silver Alert Canada and BC Silver Alert, say wandering is a common risk for people living with dementia or Alzheimer’s.

They may not even be aware they’re lost.READ ALSO:New web tool aims to enlist Canadians to help find missing kidsIn February, the federal government said it was working on a national dementia strategy because seniors are the fastest-growing population group in Canada and the number of searches for missing persons living with dementia are expected to increase significantly.Canada has a National Public Alerting System (NPAS), known as AlertReady, that gives emergency management organizations across Canada the ability to quickly warn the public of imminent or ongoing hazards (such as tsunamis or chemical spills) through radio, T.V., email, text or smartphone alerts.Emergency management is a responsibility shared by federal, provincial and territorial governments, so each jurisdiction is responsible for issuing alerts through the NPAS. In most provinces or territories, alerts about missing senior citizens aren’t broadcast over the NPAS, but Amber Alerts and other civil emergencies are.In 2017, Manitoba and Alberta amended their Missing Persons Amendment Act to introduce a Silver Alert program, allowing them to broadcast such alerts over the NPAS.There is no B.C. approach to Silver Alerts and there are limited options for residents.

For residents outside this area, checking local news and the website for local police are currently the best options available.sophie.heizer@saanichnews.comLike us onFacebookand follow@yrlocaljourno"
156,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/life/creating-community-with-micky-fleming/,"Oct 30, 2019",Creating community with Micky Fleming,"– Story by Darcy Nybo Photography by Don DentonMicky Fleming, President and CEO of Cherish Living Group, created a community at Cherish at Central Park. She did so because she loves helping others.“Our goal is to create liveable communities for successful aging,” Fleming said. “We take into account all aspects of our residents including mind, body and spirit. The people who come here value independence, dignity and quality of life. It’s our daily goal to ensure that happens.”Fleming got her start in business as a bookkeeper for a lumber company. Once the books were balanced, she’d head outside, hop on a forklift and tidy up the yard. Then she asked if she could tackle the RFPs that came in. She did and the company won the bid. After that her boss let her set up a sales office in in Port McNeill. She was loading a truck with a forklift in the snow one day and dumped the entire load on the ground. It was then she realized she wanted to get more into the business side of things and started the CGA program.In 1982 she met her husband and in 1983 they moved to Calgary. “The first job that got me recognition was with a computer company that had 11 offices across Canada. The promotions started when I fixed their inventory system.” Fleming moved up the ranks to Chief Accountant, then Controller and then CFO.By the fall of 1989 Fleming and her husband moved back to the West Shore. She started a business which morphed into an accounting company which her sister, Dana Adams (also a CPA) now runs.Fleming spent several years analysing company needs and helping them grow. She ended up with a real estate based company where she learned how to do land development. Markets changed and Fleming changed with them.In the early 2000s the Langford Legion asked her what they could do with their property that would generate income. “I did a presentation for senior’s housing and three weeks later they accepted. The community came together, and we built a highly successful residence that, while under our management, boasted a long wait list and very happy customers.”Some years ago Fleming met with the Elders of the Redeemer Lutheran Church. “They approached me about senior’s housing and the hopes of their congregation in a somewhat unique situation. After much research in the USA, Fleming was able to develop a viable business plan that met the criteria of the congregation and the financiers.”In 2012 Fleming and Adams signed the contract with Redeemer and in 2016 they purchased the land.“It took four years to raise the capital and our first resident moved into Cherish at Central Park in November 2017. We are pet friendly and have about 130 people living here now. We wanted an intergenerational residence and got that. The Lutheran Church is inside our building. They own their space and we own ours.”Fleming takes the responsibility of making a difference very seriously. “At Cherish we help people maintain their independence as they age. We get to know everyone who lives here and they get to know each other. We give the people here a voice. We listen as a group. The people who live here get things done. They raise funds for great causes. The self-confidence and sense of purpose that comes with that is very real. Creating this Cherish community is what I was meant to do.”When she’s not working, Fleming likes to unwind in nature. “I love being out on the water and I love the woods. I love flowers that attract hummingbirds and bees.”When asked what advice she would give to others starting out in business, she had this to say: “Take responsibility for what you do and where you go in life. You can’t let your history be an anchor. Anything you put your mind to is possible if you are willing to work for it.”Daily Uniform:Mostly business casual unless I’m working in the garden and I wear jeans.Favourite pair of shoes:Day to day, I love my black slip-ons with a small heel. My absolute favourite are handmade art nouveau Fluevog’s with 6” heels.Must Wear:My wedding rings. The nuggets in them come from my dad’s claim in the Yukon.Favourite watch:Bulova ladies sports watch.Style Icons:Grace Kelly and Judy Dench.Favourite Scent:L’Instant de Guerlain.

There is space for a senior and their care attendant, and they are covered by a cozy blanket.ALSO READ: Food inspectors help keep the Saanich Peninsula safeThe organization that came up with the idea nationally is Cycling Without Age, estimated to have around 40 chapters across Canada. The Sidney group is loosely affiliated to this founder organization but is organized as a free-standing non-profit.The similarly named Cycling Without Age Society decided to go down the stand-alone route as it didn’t want to be restricted to one care facility, like many other affiliates are. They wanted to be able to serve all the care homes in the area and to be able to grow to meet demand.Eight pilots have been trained, or are undergoing training, and a test run has been completed. Pilots have to possess clean criminal records and valid driving licenses, and are then put through a two day training course, including six hours of trishaw bike training.ALSO READ: Car sharing coming to Central Saanich“It’s a treat for Sidney and its residents. We’re doing it as it’s active citizenship, returning people to their community,” says Steve Duck, President of Cycling Without Age Society.The company hopes to offer its first ride within the next two weeks and plan to offer two rides a day, growing to three a day, as the afternoons grow longer. Trips are tailored to care residences’ schedules and are designed to be stimulating and fun for seniors.“It’s been such a treat to see the response. We did a trial run and took a gentleman with early-set dementia on a ride. The care staff told us he was having a bad morning but the ride changed his entire day and he still speaks about it,” says Duck.Duck came across a similar group two years ago and when he saw the joy from seniors he decided to band together with a group of other volunteers to set up their chapter.ALSO READ: Sidney Fire provides free smoke alarmsAt present they have one $13,000 trishaw and hope to, one day, purchase a fleet of six.The Town of Sidney have given them a grant, as have the Sidney Lions and Russ Hay’s bike shop donated a bike that they raffled to raise funds.Duck says that they are working towards charitable foundation status.“If I see a nickel rolling down the road I’ll jump on it,” he laughs. “We want people to feel the wind in their hair and have smiles on their faces.”For more information visitcyclingwithoutagesociety.com.nick.murray@peninsulanewsreview.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"
158,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/b-c-seniors-advocate-questions-labour-shortage-in-care-homes/,"Feb 20, 2019",B.C. Seniors Advocate questions labour shortage in care homes,"B.C.’s health care budget has the biggest numbers of any provincial government function, but for seniors in residential care, the most important numbers are the small ones.A key one is, do they get one bath per week, or two?The standard for each senior in a provincially funded home is 3.36 hours of care per day, a target Health Minister Adrian Dix has pledged to meet by 2021 by adding operating money and staff to provincial and contracted care homes.Last year’s budget committed extra funds toward that goal, with $48.4 million in the current budget allocated to 183 facilities around the province for care aides, physiotherapists and other support staff. Dix has said that the key is to recruit 1,500 full-time equivalent people, 900 of them care aides, to fill the persistent service gap, after more than 800 care aides moved from part-time to full-time work.After the release of the B.C. budget this week, the problem was highlighted by Mike Klassen, vice president of the B.C. Care Providers Association. He called the ministry’s three-year staff funding commitment “extremely generous,” and noted that Finance Minister Carole James’ new budget adds additional money for training.RELATED:Only 15% of care homes met standard by 2018RELATED:Still too many seniors in care, or at home on drugs“We’re at full employment in B.C. right now, so what we’re seeing is a lot of care providers are really coming up short,” Klassen said. “So seniors are not getting the care they need because of those staffing shortages.”B.C. Seniors’ Advocate Isobel Mackenzie questions that conclusion. She said the latest budget confirms the health ministry’s three-year commitment to reach the care hours target, which was first made by the previous B.C. Liberal government.Mackenzie’s office did some checking in an effort to verify the labour shortage. The Health Employers Association maintains a “difficult-to-fill vacancy report,” and she said care aides are not on the list. And a check of job ads also came up empty.“The other thing that the industry doesn’t really want to talk about, but I think has to be talked about, is the wage differential,” Mackenzie said in an interview with Black Press. “If you’re going to say, ‘I can’t hire anybody but I’m going to pay $19 an hour,’ and down the street they’re paying $24 an hour and they are getting people, I think the solution to your problem is pretty obvious. Pay them 24 bucks an hour.”The Seniors Advocate office has tested results with regular surveys of seniors at home, in assisted living and in residential care, a process Mackenzie intends to expand.“We can say we’re funding a care facility for 3.36 hours, but we can’t verify that’s what they’re providing,” Mackenzie said. “We need a very robust monitoring mechanism in place to make sure that care operators who are receiving funds for care hours are using those to deliver those care hours.”@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

Like many British Columbians, Skidmore can’t afford to buy in the current market, and renting at current prices is unsustainable. As a retiree, Skidmore has limited options to increase her income to match growing prices.But unlike many British Colombians, Skidmore is not fazed by the market, nor is she frustrated about her situation.Skidmore has been house sitting in Oak Bay since January. She’ll return the Kootenays in mid-February before moving here full time in the summer. Sensitive to cold weather, she wanted to see how a Victoria winter felt as she usually travels south to warmer climates.“What I’m doing is putting more feelers out and trying to make a network of people that I meet, people that I talk to, people who know people, people who I talk to on the bus,” Skidmore said.“I’m creating that while I’m here, while I have some time, and then I’ll continue expanding that between now and July.”Skidmore has owned more than a half a dozen homes and has been a landlord herself. She sold her most recent property in 2017, which she described as a Canadian landing pad.“Some people have sat in the same home for 40 years and it’s appreciated and they’re going ‘wow, the mortgage is paid off, my house is worth $1.5 million, I bought it for $43,000, I’m fine,’” Skidmore said. “Then, [there are] others who’ve moved around a bit or travelled or sold.”The new mortgage rules and a fixed income have shrunk Skidmore’s potential ability to buy again for the time being.“There are many people like me — particularly in my age group — that are caught in that middle space, that sort of no where land, of now not being able to re-buy into the housing market. But not being able to afford high rents either,” Skidmore said. “I wouldn’t call it unfortunate. It’s just the way it is.”Kaye Melliship of the Greater Victoria Housing Society (GVHS) said affordable seniors housing is needed in Victoria, and the way demographics are trending it’s a need that will only increase with time.“We currently have about 550 apartments for seniors, so we know because of the demand for them and the take-up our housing units that there is a need,” Melliship said. “There’s a gap between fixed incomes and modest pensions, and the cost of living in the market.”Melliship noted the society will have close to 150 units available for seniors being built over the next two to three years, although not all of the units will be specifically for seniors. Aside from permits, one of the biggest barriers to building affordable housing is cost, she noted. In order to keep units affordable, the GVHS and similar organizations must pay more upfront for developments. That funding typically comes from governments rather than residents.READ MORE:New 84-unit seniors housing in Saanich constructed to Built Green standardsSingle seniors are often hit the hardest in the tight market.“Most of the seniors that we house are single people. And it’s just the one income problem,” Melliship said. “It’s the same really for families too, it’s hard to provide housing to families on one income.”For her part, Skidmore remains optimistic — something she insisted be made clear.“I’m finding it’s very interesting that I’m keeping that approach. I think I told myself initially, having lived in and near Nelson, I know what it’s like to have a very difficult rental market,” Skidmore said. “I told myself, ‘you want to go to Victoria? You can’t let yourself start telling yourself negative things about moving to Victoria. You have to keep saying this is going to work, this is going to work, I’m going to find something.’”Skidmore is open to living elsewhere in the region, other than Oak Bay, even moving to one the Gulf Islands. Ideally, she’d like to have a place above ground with a garden but understands she might not get her dream home.

She and her sister, 75-year-old Carol Harris, are fiercely independent despite both suffering from some serious health ailments.Along with Carol’s service dog, a French poodle named Pierre, the sisters found themselves snowed-in, with big snow drifts blocking their driveway and road, so that their caregivers couldn’t visit them.When the power went out, plunging them into darkness, the two sisters put on headlamps and prepared to cope as best they could.ALSO READ: Wall of ice blocking Tulista Park boat ramp to be cleared Friday“In situations like this, when you don’t have your full body capabilities, but you have your marbles, you can think of ways to survive,” said Juanita.The two seniors have lived together in Carolwood Manor for the past 21 years and on the same street for the last 50. They say they are proud to live alone and don’t like to complain or inconvenience others. They were also wary to call for help in case district authorities saw them as too vulnerable to live alone, or to have “lost their marbles,” as Juanita put it.However, their caregiver, Patricia Hirsch, recognized the severity of their predicament and called the North Saanich Fire Department for assistance.Despite being busy with call-outs and medical checks, the department – consisting mostly of volunteers – was able to send Lt. Spencer Barkley, firefighter Jordan Kelly and recruit Rob Howland to assist.“There was a knock at the door and three handsome gentlemen in uniform were there,” Juanita said. With a laugh, she continued, “the first thing I said was ‘but we don’t have a fire.’”The firefighters explained they were there to help. They put the kettle on for the ladies, opened some canned food, checked the fridge was well-stocked and cleared the driveway for them.ALSO READ: Snow a boon to some North Saanich businesses“They were very respectful and also funny. We laughed and had a joke, and it brought sunshine to Carolwood Manor,” said Juanita.“It was so nice. We saw these young men and said to each other ‘that’s the type of people we need in our community.’ I think they have the right spirit to be in community service.”Carol added, “we’d like to say a nice thank you.”The sisters have always liked helping others and have been active in the community in the past, hosting fundraisers and working with international students. Juanita even served the United Nations as a mission doctor, travelling to a host of far-flung places, including China and the Ivory Coast.When asked why they called themselves the “two chicks by the sea,” Juanita’s eyes sparkled.“You have a voice to bring humour and laughter. We were the Canadian Oumas for the international students, when we were in the U.S. we were the Canadian geese. It’s just to give a person a laugh. Now, we’re the two chicks by the sea.”ALSO READ: West Shore boathouse, with 100-year-old boat inside, partially breaks free during stormThe North Saanich Fire Department reported a very busy time responding to snow-related call-outs in addition to their regular duties.To thank the firefighters, who the sisters called their “guardian angels,” Juanita and Carol wrote this letter:Guardian angels in a time of needChallenges in life pose hardship but inspire a lot of amazing things to happen. Sometimes community steps up to give a hand to seniors experiencing a difficult time. During the recent blizzard, my sister Carol and I were struggling to endure and things seemed bleak. None of our staff were able to reach us. And then one of our caregivers, being concerned for our wellbeing, called the North Saanich Fire Department. In no time at all, there was a knock at our door and three handsome firemen appeared. “We came to see if we could help you,” they said. They immediately cleared our driveway making our exit accessible. They filled our kettle, opened some canned food, which we’d been struggling to do, and assisted with our little service dog. We chatted and they left Carolwood Manor filled with joy and happiness, and we were reassured that people cared about us. It seems like thank-you is not enough, but two grateful ladies will never forget these acts of kindness at a very dark time.Sincerely,“Two Chicks by the Sea.”nick.murray@peninsulanewsreview.comLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter"

The report covers the 2017/18 fiscal year, ending March 31, 2018, which predates our government’s seniors plan, and the historic investment made in seniors care in Budget 2018.Our government is investing $1.048 billion over three years to improve care for seniors, including investments in primary care, home health, residential care, assisted living and respite services. The Seniors Advocate Report supports the government’s decision regarding implementing a substantial seniors strategy, and we will be referring to it in measuring the progress our plan.To address the increase in seniors waiting to attend adult day programs we are providing $75 million over the next three years to expand this. As an example, Island Health has planned for 7,400 more spaces. By increasing these spaces, we will help seniors continue living in their homes longer, delay or avoid moving to residential care, and will better support caregivers and give them the relief they need.A total of $240 million is being invested to increase direct care hours for seniors to an average of 3.36 hours per patient per day by 2021. More educational spaces for health-care assistants are being created across B.C. to help support this. And, through the Health Sector Statutes Repeal Act, continuity of care for seniors will improve with improved job security and stability for health care staff.We look forward to working with the Seniors Advocate to monitor and review how these investments in seniors are benefiting them, and to ensure the best of care.Adrian DixB.C.

163,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/opinion/b-c-views-seniors-home-worker-discrimination-finally-ending/,"Nov 11, 2018",B.C. VIEWS: Seniors home worker discrimination finally ending,"This column has been hard on the B.C. NDP government’s favours to big labour in recent weeks.Their union monopoly on public construction is a discriminatory sell-out that will be costing taxpayers for years to come, and the likely elimination of secret ballot votes is another bid to protect unions that are dwindling away in today’s global economy.But this week I’ll offer my appreciation to Health Minister Adrian Dix, who has won a battle he has been fighting for more than a decade, restoring union successor rights for employees of senior care homes and related jobs. This is to end “contract flipping,” where one contractor takes over from another and gets out from under the union agreement, usually with the Hospital Employees’ Union or the B.C. Government Employees’ Union.Here’s how BCGEU president Stephanie Smith explained the problem that has plagued one of the lowest-wage, female-dominated employment groups in the province since 2002:“The practice of contract flipping typically involves mass layoffs and forces workers to re-apply for jobs that they have, in many cases, already been performing for years. When this occurs, existing collective agreements and union representation are not carried over, and contracts offered by the new service provider typically offer lower wages, reduced benefits and weakened rights for employees. In short, contract flipping is a strategy for suppressing wages and weakening employee rights in the workplace.”Dix introduced legislation last week to repeal two provisions that survived the B.C. Liberal government’s long court battle with the HEU, making employees “second class citizens” as contract-flipping continued into this year.“There are care homes such as Inglewood on the North Shore and Nanaimo Seniors Village that have seen their contracts flipped multiple times,” Dix said. “In other words, work is contracted out, the workers come together, they organize a union, they negotiate with the employer, in this case the contractor. Then the contractor is changed, salaries are reduced and they have to go through the process again and again and again.”I recall the bitter debate when this move was made by a newly elected Gordon Campbell government with an overwhelming mandate, the NDP reduced to two East Vancouver seats. One B.C. Liberal MLA noted that under generous contracts signed with the previous NDP government, an HEU employee was entitled to a paid day off to take his or her dog to the veterinarian.No one at that time anticipated the repeated use of contract flipping in senior care homes, just as no one anticipated the sale of Retirement Concepts, a Vancouver-based chain of contract care homes, to a state-linked Chinese company that’s acquiring prime real estate around the world.What the Campbell government should have seen coming was that this crackdown on a ballooning health care budget came at the worst possible time for senior care. Baby boomers are stepping down, and breaking down, in huge numbers, and there aren’t enough people who will take care of them under the working conditions they face.Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie put numbers to it in B.C.’s first comprehensive survey of seniors homes last year. It showed that most don’t meet the province’s standard of just over three hours care per resident, per day. Help in the bathroom is one of the biggest shortages, and Dix estimates that another 900 care aides are needed to reach the standard.Not enough people are willing to do this job, and long-term workers are retiring themselves.Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press Media.

Labour Relations Code, allowing them to avoid successor rights and common employer declarations when operation of a care home shifts from one contractor to another.The legislation led to thousands of care home employees being laid off and then offered their jobs back with reduced wages and benefits, Dix said.Repealing law will stop “contract flipping” in seniors care homes says@adriandix#bcpolipic.twitter.com/nlVXMqris0— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc)November 8, 2018“Fragmentation of health care delivery, the disruption of care relationships, and more precarious and lower-paid work is the direct result of these mean-spirited laws,” said Jennifer Whiteside, secretary-business manager of the HEU.Dix said Thursday the new provisions will not be implemented immediately, to allow the operators to adjust. Stability is urgently needed to attract more care aides and bring facilities up to the province’s standard of more than three hours per day of personal care per patient, he said.RELATED:Bathing, meal times need work, residential care survey findsCare aides provide “the most important personal care in the life of a senior,” and there are 29,000 currently in government and contracted care facilities, Dix said.

Surveys have shown that the vast majority of seniors want to stay in their homes, but they need adequate housekeeping and medical support.Health Minister Adrian Dix has also been struggling with the deficit in care hours per patient in care homes, which is below the government’s target in many cases.Mackenzie said the data show people with cognitive and physical ability to be on their own, or in assisted living residences, are in care facilities. If they can get around with a walker and have sufficient mental ability, they should be supported at home, she said.“Why do we see higher functioning seniors in long-term care,” the report asks.Seniors Advocate full report is here.https://t.co/bTAhtHxE0rAnd these are the challenges for@adriandixand@carolejamesat health budget time#bcpolipic.twitter.com/ijKhJqicd0— Tom Fletcher (@tomfletcherbc)September 20, 2018@tomfletcherbctfletcher@blackpress.caLike us onFacebookand follow us onTwitter."

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie, the latest measure of performance of senior care.“After a careful review of multi-year data, a consistent pattern emerges that shows a demonstrably greater use of he emergency department and hospital beds by residents from contracted long-term care facilities versus residents from publicly run facilities, and a stunning 54 per cent greater likelihood that you will die in the hospital if you live in a contracted care facility versus a publicly operated facility,” Mackenzie said Wednesday.Analysis of hospital data showed that residents of contracted care homes were 32 per cent more likely to be sent to emergency, 34 per cent more likely to be admitted to hospital, spent more time in hospital and were 47 per cent more likely to be transferred to a different level of facility when released.The B.C. Care Providers’ Association, representing contracted care homes, disputed the findings. Association CEO Daniel Fontaine said the report does not determine how many of the higher rate of emergency visits were legitimate visits, and the report contains “questionable assumptions and political buzzwords, rather than independent research.”Health Minister Adrian Dix said in an interview the gap between public and private care home staffing occurred during the B.C. Liberal government, when 91 per cent of care homes didn’t meet provincial standard for direct care hours. The health care budget now includes a record increase intended to meet that standard, on average, in every health authority, he said.“I’m acting on care standards, I’m acting on more beds, I’m acting on improving supports in the community because we want fewer people going into care,” Dix said.There are 293 publicly subsidized care facilities in B.C., a third of which are directly operated by provincial health authorities. The rest are contracted with a mix of private companies and not-for-profit organizations.RELATED:Care home directory rates B.C. facilitiesPrevious studies by Mackenzie’s office have noted that contract care facilities are funded for fewer hours of direct care than public facilities, including physiotherapy, occupational and recreational therapy. They also are the subject of more complaints from residents and families.“We know that contracted facilities have more substantiated complaints and reportable incidents than public facilities,” the report states. “But in the recent province-wide satisfaction survey of all subsidized contracted and public care facilities in the province, there was no overall difference in the level of satisfaction and quality of life indicators between those facilities operated by a health authority (public) and those facilities operated by the contractors.”"

Plus, there’s perks—free talcum powder and hair products — “if you have any hair.”A former professional water skier, Hughes retired thirty years ago, the same year he joined the Y where classes for suitable for seniors include: Senior Strength, Senior Cardio, and in the pool, Gentle Flow Aqua and Gentle Aqua Fit.Senior Strength was so popular that another class was created to manage the overflow, said program supervisor, Litzia Eccleston,Hughes’ favourite class is Cyclefit, which is held in Burt’s Bike Room, named for the 94-year-old regular who left provisions in his will to outfit the room.Hughes believes regular cycling staves off Alzheimer’s Disease.“It pumps that blood to the brain, and Alzheimer’s is about blood congestion, so anything that helps that flow is good,” he said.There are currently 584 gym members between the ages of 70 and 80 and 127 in the 80 to 90 age bracket and 11 members in the over 90s club, who receive free membership.And for seniors in Victoria, there’s more than one choice to get the daily workouts in.Retired physiotherapist Stephen Lamb attends up to three exercise classes at the Juan de Fuca Recreation Centre. The 84-year-old believes regular physical activity helped him recover from a stroke in Feb. 2017.“Oh, God, yes,” he said. “As soon as a person regains consciousness and they can move around, they gotta get at it.”Lamb worked for 60 years and retired only two years ago. He said he’d be much stiffer and probably weaker without moving daily.“No matter what your age, regular exercise will make a difference in your life,” said Dr. Ian Bekker, who works at the Saanich Peninsula Health Unit Geriatrics Clinic.“In the hot air balloon ride of life, age is like the opening at the top of the balloon slowly bringing you back to earth, while exercise is the fire at the bottom of the balloon that keeps your view marvellous,” he explained.After the age of 40, the body is “increasingly interested in winding things up,” Bekker added.“Exercise is the only way to signal to the body that vitality is still required. Telling your body to swim, climb, row or bike is speaking to all the cells of your body, ‘There are still things left to do, keep this body in good shape.”In almost every one of his geriatric assessments, Bekker recommends more exercise.“It is going to reduce their chance of falling or reduce the progression of their dementia,” and he gives the analogy of squeezing a ball to make the hand stronger.“Alternatively, anything that is good for your cardiovascular health is good for your brain. Sweat on the outside releases brain building chemistry on the inside.”Although starting an exercise program may be daunting, Hughes, who is looking for to joining the Y’s over 90s club, advises:“Take your time, stop when you need to and don’t try to keep up with anyone. Go at your own pace.”SeniorsYMCA84 year old Stephen Lamb attends up to three exercise classes a week. Anna James/VICTORIA NEWS"
169,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/news/bc-budget-new-money-helps-seniors-care-shortage/,"Feb 21, 2018",BC BUDGET: New money helps seniors’ care shortage,"The B.C. government’s commitment to raise care standards in seniors’ homes turns out to be an additional $548 million over the next three years in the NDP government’s first budget.What remains to be seen is whether that money is enough to attract and hold workers, says a leader of the union representing many employees working in residential care homes.“There is no question that we have a recruitment and retention crisis in long-term care for seniors,” said Jennifer Whiteside, secretary-business manager of the Hospital Employees Union. “For too many staff who provide this important care to seniors, the work is unstable. They are at risk of losing their jobs.”Whiteside points to Finnish Manor, a Burnaby facility where the owners laid off the entire staff of 50 last week, then contracted out the jobs with what she says are lower wages and benefits.B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie does annual surveys of care home service levels. Her latest report in January found 85 per cent of B.C.’s 293 publicly funded residential care homes don’t have enough staff to provide the 3.35 hours per patient per day that the health ministry sets as a standard.Mackenzie found that facilities owned and operated by regional health authorities are generally funded to meet the care hours, as well as higher rates of therapy and more physically dependent residents than contracted operators.Mike Klassen, communications director for the B.C. Care Providers’ Association, says the additional money is “good news for B.C. seniors.” But recruiting more staff is going to be challenging, as the government’s plan to expand child care creates additional demand on the same pool of employees needed by seniors’ homes.Whiteside says care aides need higher wages as well as an expectation of stable work.Health Minister Adrian Dix says 900 additional care aides are needed to meet the care standard across the province. The additional money allows health authorities to offer full-time work to part-time and casual employees.BC legislatureSeniors"
170,https://www.vancouverislandfreedaily.com/opinion/b-c-views-who-will-care-for-frail-elderly/,"Feb 4, 2018",B.C. VIEWS: Who will care for frail elderly?,"The B.C. NDP government has taken its first significant step to close the wide and persistent gap between the reality of basic support for seniors in residential care and the province’s target.Officially, that target is an average 3.36 hours of personal care per patient, per day. In practical terms, that means getting two baths a week instead of one, or being escorted with a walker to the dining room instead of being whisked there in a wheelchair by an overworked employee.In human terms, it means an isolated, lonely senior is not just cleaner and more comfortable, he or she gets a few more minutes of personal contact to relieve the tedium of confinement and the junk of daytime TV.B.C.’s Seniors Advocate, Isobel Mackenzie, reported last week that as of March 2017, that standard was being met in 15 per cent of publicly funded care homes. That’s up from nine-per-cent compliance the previous year, based on an annual survey of the 293 public and contracted care homes across the province.The first move was communicated to facility operators in conference calls last week, and will be confirmed in the NDP government budget on Feb. 20. Authorities will be funded to increase their casual and part-time care aide positions to full time as of April 1.Health Minister Adrian Dix cautions that this is at best a partial solution, even with half of the current workforce in casual and part-time positions. Not all will accept full-time work.“To reach the 3.36 [hours target], we’re told that it will require 900 net new care aides, in a sector where more than a quarter of care aides are over 55,” Dix told me. “So there would be considerable effort just to stay where we are now, and this is going to require a significant number of new care aides.”Daniel Fontaine, CEO of the B.C. Care Providers Association, agrees: “Moving from casual to full-time is not going to do it.”Fontaine has been pushing to expand dual-credit high school courses to get more young people into senior care as a first job, with virtually guaranteed employment even in rural and remote communities. These high school spaces are now mainly focused on male-dominated skilled trades, while popular culture bombards teens with the allure of high-tech careers.At a residential care conference in Surrey Jan. 26, Dix announced new post-secondary training spaces for care aides. Unfortunately, the government is also embarking on an aggressive expansion of child care, and the labour pool for that is largely the same people.Fontaine says he’s hearing regularly from private colleges around B.C. that have vacant health care assistant training spaces now. The fastest solution would be to fill those spaces with immigrants eager to work, but there’s a problem. Federal immigration authorities won’t issue work permits unless students train at a public college. So the province wastes money on duplicate public spaces due to Ottawa’s arbitrary rules.And of course the shortage of young workers mirrors the vast growth in seniors as baby boomers retire. There are currently 28,000 seniors in publicly funded residential care in B.C., out of an estimated 850,000 people over 65. Total senior population is projected to reach 1.4 million over the next 15 years.“But over 75, that number is going to increase by two and a half times in the next 20 years,” Dix said.Progress is slowly being made, thanks to the work of the Seniors Advocate’s office to report this situation to the public and to governments.Tom Fletcher is B.C. legislature reporter and columnist for Black Press.

Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie reported Wednesday in the latest edition of her Residential Care FacilitiesQuick Facts Directory.The key reason for the shortfall is money to pay sufficient staff. The province-wide survey finds that overall, B.C. residential care facilities are funded at an average of 3.14 direct care hours per resident per day. Contracted facilities were funded for an average of 3.01 hours, and health authority owned and operated facilities averaged 3.35 hours, almost up the the B.C. government’s target.Jennifer Whiteside, secretary-business manager of the Hospital Employees’ Union, said Wednesday’s report is a familiar story of understaffed facilities in B.C, with 85 per cent of them still not meeting the government’s own standard.“When there are not enough staff on shift to do their jobs to the highest possible standard, seniors and those who provide their care are put at risk,” Whiteside said. “Staff simply cannot provide the level and quality of care needed to keep themselves and their residents safe.”"

It will include a break in the middle where the tester will provide feedback about driving performance.What the province calls “enhanced road assessment” can be required due to a doctor’s report of a medical condition, a police report of an accident or reports of a previous on-road assessment.“The vast majority of B.C. seniors successfully pass the driver’s medical exam,” said Isobel Mackenzie, B.C.’s Seniors Advocate. “For those very few who are referred for further testing, the changes being implemented by RoadSafetyBC represent a major improvement from the past system and will make the process much less stressful for those seniors required to undertake the test.”RoadSafetyBC evaluated the driving fitness of 170,000 people in 2016, and 3,000 of them were referred for an ICBC reassessment. Of those, 1,000 completed the DriveABLE test.BC legislatureSeniors"
