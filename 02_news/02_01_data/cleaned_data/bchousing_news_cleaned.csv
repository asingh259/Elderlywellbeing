Affordable housing is key to Canada’s pandemic recovery, especially for communities across the country, including in Chilliwack. Today, John Aldag, Member of Parliament for Cloverdale–Langley City, on behalf of the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, along with Dan Coulter, MLA for Chilliwack, and Ken Popove, Mayor of Chilliwack, announced that construction on a 66-unit affordable rental housing project for independent seniors and youth is underway in Chilliwack. Located at 46187 Yale Road, the six-storey building called the Paramount will provide 58 units of affordable rental housing for seniors, and eight units for young adults between the ages of 19 and 25. This housing project is unique in Chilliwack, and one of only a few in the province to offer a continuum of affordable housing for youth transitioning from the child welfare system. Operated by Chilliwack Community Services, the Paramount project will be an innovative, mixed-use development that will include both residential and commercial spaces. The residential space will be a mix of affordable studio, one- and two-bedroom units, including 13 that are wheelchair-accessible, in addition to laundry and lounge spaces. Rents are expected to range from $375 for a studio unit to $1,500 for a two-bedroom unit. The Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, is contributing $7 million in combined Canada Community Housing Initiative and BC Priorities Housing Initiative bilateral agreement grants. The Province, through BC Housing, is providing $105,500 in funding through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund, and an annual operating subsidy of $391,522. The City of Chilliwack is providing the land for the project and, as well as over $1 million in waived fees and development costs. The City also expedited development approvals for the project. Construction is expected to be completed in winter 2024. Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion – “Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. Our government continues to find ways to create more affordable homes that meet the needs of Canadians, including right here in Chilliwack. This is the National Housing Strategy at work, and we will continue to ensure no one is left behind.” John Aldag, Member of Parliament for Cloverdale–Langley City – “The Paramount project is yet another example of what can be achieved when we work together. Through this collaboration, our government is helping to ensure that Chilliwack’s seniors and youth have safe and affordable housing that enables them to thrive.” Dan Coulter, Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia for Chilliwack – “Too many people in our community, including youth and seniors, don’t have access to the affordable housing they need. That’s why our government is working with partners at all levels of government to build safe and affordable homes where youth can have a stable foundation to take the next steps toward adulthood and seniors can stay connected to their community, while living independently.” Ken Popove, Mayor of Chilliwack – “We know from our Housing Needs of Aging Adults study that seniors are the fastest growing age group in Chilliwack, and that housing affordability is the most significant factor they face. The Paramount project will help meet a critical need in the community and will be an important part of the housing continuum for youth and seniors with limited income. We are grateful for the support of the Government of Canada, Province of British Columbia, and Chilliwack Community Services, and look forward to this project’s completion.” Luke Zacharias, Board President, Chilliwack Community Services – “Chilliwack Community Services is committed to providing affordable and safe housing for seniors and young adults in Chilliwack and contributing to addressing one of the top needs here in our community. The Paramount Project has been a vision of CCS for many years. It has been realized through the support of the Province of British Columbia, through BC Housing, and the City of Chilliwack for their generous contribution of land and waiving of fees.” ","CHILLIWACK– Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home.

""The housing crisis has left people throughout B.C., including those with middle-incomes, unable to find a home to rent or buy,"" said Grace Lore, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill. ""This project is an example of how our government is creating a new inventory of homes through our HousingHub that would otherwise not exist. This means more homes for people living in Victoria and more opportunities for middle-income buyers to own their first home."" Located at 1109 and 1115 Johnson St., Haven will be a six-storey condominium with 104 homes, including a mix of studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom units. All units are reserved for families, seniors and individuals with middle incomes. Buyers will receive a no-interest, no monthly payment second mortgage to support their purchase. This second participating mortgage assists the buyer on the equity portion of their purchase, helping reduce the income required to obtain a first mortgage and reducing its monthly payments. Qualifying buyers must have a combined household income no greater than $118,440 for homes with fewer than two bedrooms and an income no greater than $168,310 for homes with two bedrooms or more. Buyers will be required to make the home their primary residence for the first five years. These new homes are being built in partnership with Chard Development through BC Housing's HousingHub: Affordable Home Ownership Program (AHOP). The program was created to allow BC Housing to partner with the development community and municipalities throughout the province to create new homeownership opportunities for middle-income households. ""As a long-standing, family-owned developer, we take our role in the fight to improve housing affordability seriously,"" said Byron Chard, president and CEO, Chard Development. ""Haven is our second affordable homeownership offering in partnership with BC Housing and is a reflection of our commitment to creating a diversity of housing in Victoria."" BC Housing will administer the interest- and payment-free second mortgages for all 104 homes. Buyers will not need to repay the mortgages until the 25-year term limit expires or if they sell their home. At the time of repayment, the homeowner must repay the proportionate share of the current market value of the home. For example, if the home was purchased with a 10% AHOP mortgage, the homeowner must repay 10% of the current fair market value at the time of repayment. The value from that investment is then returned to the municipality to re-invest in affordable housing. ""Innovative financing through the BC HousingHub puts more attainable homes within reach for working people in Victoria,"" said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. ""Buildings like this give people a start getting into homeownership and frees up space in our very tight local rental market. The city is working alongside the Province to support affordable housing through the city's Housing Reserve Fund and by speeding up the development approvals process for affordable housing."" These new homes are part of a larger development by Chard Development that will bring housing, a day care and commercial space to the Fernwood neighbourhood. Construction on Haven is already underway and expected to be complete by early 2024. The homes are open for presale.

This study will help us make sure these, and hopefully even more, families have access to high-quality housing on this site,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""Redeveloping aging rental properties into modern, affordable homes for a range of incomes while ensuring existing tenants are protected leaves everyone better off and supports the health of the whole community."" Located at 2501 Blanshard St., Evergreen Terrace (formerly called Blanshard Court) needs redevelopment as its units are aging and require substantial renovations. The two-year study will determine how to best replace these homes and whether the site can accommodate more affordable housing. Evergreen Terrace is owned and operated by BC Housing and has provided low-income housing for Victoria seniors and families for more than 50 years. In 2020, Spaken House, a 21-unit temporary, culturally supportive housing building for Indigenous women operated by the Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness Society, was added to the site. The study is in its early stages. Tenants and community partners, as well as Spaken House residents and staff, have already received project information packages and will have the opportunity to provide input and ideas to shape development plans for the property. Given the multi-year nature of the redevelopment process, there is no need to temporarily relocate Evergreen Terrace tenants at this time and tenants are not at risk of losing their homes because of redevelopment. Upon completion of the planning and feasibility study, a rezoning application will be submitted to the City of Victoria. If the redevelopment project is approved, tenants will be supported to stay in their homes, if possible, until the new homes are completed. Existing tenants will be given the opportunity to choose new units with no changes to their monthly rent unless their income or unit size has changed in the interim.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for affordable housing and led to rising levels of homelessness. The Government of Canada created a national strategy to build hundreds of thousands of units and provide affordable housing to people across the country. By continuing to make investments in affordable housing, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments are working together to building stronger communities, creating jobs, and growing our middle class, while fighting homelessness and helping vulnerable Canadians. Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion, along with Doug McCallum, Mayor of Surrey, announced details of a $13.8 million federal allocation to support the creation of 30 new supportive homes for young people in Surrey through the Cities Stream under expanded Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI). Bruce Ralston, MLA for Surrey-Whalley, announced that the B.C. government will support the new housing with annual operating funding. This funding will build off the provincial investments made in Surrey since 2017, which are supporting the construction of nearly 1,500 new homes for a range of people who are struggling to find a place to live. The project will be operated by the Pacific Community Resource Society (PCRS), will be located at 13102 112A St in Surrey, B.C., and will feature 30 new homes with 24/7 support young people aged 17-24 years, many of whom will be transitioning from government care. All of the housing units will be allocated to vulnerable and homeless youth, with a further breakdown allocation of 25% Indigenous, 25% LGBTQ2+, 25% young women experiencing violence, and 25% newcomer youth. This project features modular construction and will be completed in winter 2022. This is in addition to the Government of Canada’s previous investment of $16.4 million through the Major Cities Stream of the first phase of the RHI to support the creation of up to 44 new affordable homes in Surrey. In its initial round, with funding of $1 billion announced in October 2020, the RHI exceeded its original target of 3,000 permanent affordable housing units and achieved 4,700 units nationally. Due to this success, an additional $1.5 billion for the RHI was recently announced to create 4,500 new units of permanent affordable housing across the country. Thanks to this expansion, this initiative will now create over 9,200 affordable homes for the most vulnerable Canadians across the country. This new investment will create thousands of good jobs in the housing and construction sector, grow the middle class, and build back stronger communities, while getting us closer to our goal of eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion – “Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. Today's funding through the Rapid Housing Initiative will go a long way to support those who need it most by quickly providing 30 new affordable homes for Surrey’s most vulnerable Youth populations, to keep them safe. This is one of the ways our National Housing Strategy continues to ensure no one is left behind.” Randeep Sarai, Member of Parliament for Surrey Centre – “Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home.

This project is a great example of what we can accomplish when all levels of government work together. A special thank you to the Pacific Community Resource Society for working with us to bring these 30 much-needed new homes to Surrey.” Sukh Dhaliwal, Member of Parliament for Surrey–Newton – “Creating housing rapidly to address BC’s housing crisis is a priority for our Government. This funding is part of our commitment to addressing severe housing needs, both here Surrey, and across the country. It will provide immediate support to create safe and stable housing to our most vulnerable populations, including youth.” Doug McCallum, Mayor of Surrey – “Today’s announcement will support young people in our community who need a safe and supportive home as they transition into adulthood. Surrey has the largest youth population in the province. This project will ensure that all our young people have the opportunity to thrive. It will deliver on the critical and urgent need for housing for vulnerable youth who are or at risk of being homelessness, including youth who are transitioning out of the government care system. Homelessness is an evolving challenge and real solutions can be found when all levels of government work together.” Michelle Shaw, Director of Operations Fraser South, Pacific Community Resources Society – “For over 30 years, PCRS has provided core support services to young people living in Surrey. As one of the largest youth housing providers in BC, we know that ensuring youth, especially those leaving care, have the best start means they have a safe and stable place to live. We are excited to partner with CMHC and the City of Surrey to offer 30 new homes for Surrey’s vulnerable and homeless youth.” Quick facts: Associated links: To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, visit:https://workingforyou.gov.bc.ca/","SURREY - Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for affordable housing and led to rising levels of homelessness. The Government of Canada created a national strategy to build hundreds of thousands of units and provide affordable housing to people across the country. By continuing to make investments in affordable housing, the federal, provincial, and municipal governments are working together to build stronger communities, create jobs, and grow our middle class, while reducing homelessness and helping vulnerable Canadians.

The B.C. government will support the new housing with annual operating funding. The first project, located at 162 Main St., will provide 68 homes, while the second project, located at 545 E Cordova St., will provide 20 homes. Both projects are located in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside and will prioritize Indigenous Peoples and women and children, and will also serve the LGBTQ2+ community and those at risk of homelessness. Lookout Housing and Health Society will operate the project at 545 E Cordova St. BC Housing will work with the City of Vancouver to select an experienced non-profit operator for the project at 162 Main St. Both projects are expected to begin construction in the coming weeks and be ready for occupancy by December 2022. This is in addition to the Government of Canada’s previous investment of $51.5 million through the Major Cities Stream of the first phase of the RHI to support the creation of up to 135 new affordable homes in Vancouver. In its initial round, with funding of $1 billion announced in October 2020, the RHI exceeded its original target of 3,000 permanent affordable housing units and achieved 4,700 units nationally. Due to this success, an additional $1.5 billion for the RHI was recently announced to create 4,500 new units of permanent affordable housing across the country.

Due to this success, an additional $1.5 billion for the RHI was recently announced to create 4,500 new units of permanent affordable housing across the country. Thanks to this expansion, this initiative will now create over 9,200 affordable homes for the most vulnerable Canadians across the country. This new investment will create thousands of good jobs in the housing and construction sector, grow the middle class, and build back stronger communities, while getting us closer to our goal of eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Housing and Diversity and Inclusion – “Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. Today's funding through the Rapid Housing Initiative will go a long way to support those who need it most by quickly providing 45 new affordable homes for Indigenous populations of the Capital Regional District, to keep them safe. This is one of the ways our National Housing Strategy continues to ensure no one is left behind.” Grace Lore, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill – “Our government is working quickly with our partners to make sure people in need have access to permanent homes with supports in the Capital region, as part of our 10-year plan to build the homes that people need in every corner of the province. I look forward to seeing the significant difference I know these homes will have on the lives of the Indigenous peoples that will call this building home.” Lisa Helps, Mayor of Victoria – “The pandemic has laid bare the many gaps in our social fabric for those on the margins, particularly when it comes to housing. Only through true collaboration at every level of government can we make meaningful impacts to close those gaps. This project shows what we can achieve when we work together.” Colin Plant, Chair of the Capital Regional District – “The CRD works collaboratively with our municipal, federal and provincial partners to build safe, vibrant and accessible communities. We are committed to working with the community and government partners to leverage resources in order to create more housing to improve the quality of life of people experiencing, or at risk of experiencing, homelessness.” Fran Hunt-Jinnouchi, Director of Housing Development and Research, Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness Society – “We are honoured to operate culturally supportive housing on the territory of the Esquimalt and Songhees nations. Our approach is to provide more than a physical home - through our Dual Model of Housing Care we will provide teachings deeply rooted in the land, and will provide pathways to healing and recovery. We look forward to fostering strong relationships with our neighbours and serving First Nations, Metis, and Inuit people who are unhoused or underserved through love and humility.” Associated links: Media contacts: Mikaela HarrisonPress SecretaryOffice of the Minister of Families, Children and Social DevelopmentMikaela.Harrison@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca Media RelationsCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporationmedia@cmhc-schl.gc.ca Ministry of Attorney General and Responsible for BC"

""These homes will go a long way to addressing the critical need for affordable housing in Parksville,"" said Adam Walker, MLA for Parksville-Qualicum. ""I look forward to seeing the difference these new rental homes will have on the lives of the families and seniors that will call this place home."" Located at 360 Moilliet St. S., some of these homes will also be geared to people who have been commuting into town for work, because they can't find affordable housing in Parksville. The new development will consist of eight three-bedroom town homes and a 79-unit apartment building with one- and two-bedroom options. The Province is providing approximately $9.5 million through the Building BC: Community Housing Fund and will provide approximately $598,000 in annual operational funding. The City of Parksville and the Regional District of Nanaimo waived development costs totalling $725,000 for this development. To help preserve the large mature trees and provide natural stormwater management, a 0.5- hectare (1.25 acres) parkland on the building site is being protected as park space. The building will be operated by the Nanaimo Affordable Housing Society, which will have on- site office space. People are expected to start moving into their new homes in spring/summer 2023. Quotes: Ed Mayne, mayor, City of Parksville - ""I'm excited for the people who will be living in these new homes. We know there are many families needing quality affordable housing.

29,https://news.bchousing.org/new-life-for-libby-lodge-seniors-housing/,04-10-2021,New life for Libby Lodge seniors' housing,"The story of Libby Lodge begins with its opening in October 1978. Back then, the idea of helping people “age in place” was new. Thanks to Lydia Libby, the Government of BC and three, dedicated women from the Horseshoe Bay Community Association, it became a reality. In 1973, the retired Dundarave Pharmacy owner noticed the lack of affordable seniors' housing on the North Shore. At the time, seniors facing health issues often had to leave the community and their families to get suitable housing. Years later, at the Libby Lodge grand opening, Lydia responded to a reporter's question about how the project started: “I mentioned the lack of seniors' housing at a Horseshoe Bay Community Association meeting. Suddenly it was our project. We’d never worked in development before, but we were committed to getting seniors' housing into our community.” Since then, the 44-unit senior residence building remained mostly in its original state. Over the years, normal wear and tear took a toll. Drafty, old windows, walls and roofing resulted in high energy costs and maintenance issues. Teams from BC Housing worked together to complete the building rehabilitation. Building improvements included replacing the entire building exterior. This involved adding new roofs, windows, outside doors, siding, balcony deck waterproofing and guardrails. Upgrades to the building’s elevator, venting, heating, fire safety and entry phone, fob and CCTV camera systems were also done. The inside common areas received new flooring, paint, door hardware and signage. Lighting was replaced and a new air-conditioning system was added to the resident Amenity Room. Each residential unit got new fan systems for kitchens and bathrooms. Libby Lodge’s curb appeal got a boost too, with new landscaping, paving, retaining walls, benches and outside lighting. Building improvements are a win from a building-operations view too. Better energy efficiency saves building energy and maintenance costs. The biggest win: these upgrades will extend the life of Libby Lodge for years to come for future seniors. The Libby Lodge renovation was funded from the Provincial Capital Renewal Fund. This funding of $1.36 billion is for existing provincially-owned, and non-profit owned, social housing. It restores and repairs existing buildings, increases safety against fire or earthquake, and improves energy performance.","The story of Libby Lodge begins with its opening in October 1978. Back then, the idea of helping people “age in place” was new. Thanks to Lydia Libby, the Government of BC and three, dedicated women from the Horseshoe Bay Community Association, it became a reality. In 1973, the retired Dundarave Pharmacy owner noticed the lack of affordable seniors' housing on the North Shore. At the time, seniors facing health issues often had to leave the community and their families to get suitable housing. Years later, at the Libby Lodge grand opening, Lydia responded to a reporter's question about how the project started: “I mentioned the lack of seniors' housing at a Horseshoe Bay Community Association meeting. Suddenly it was our project. We’d never worked in development before, but we were committed to getting seniors' housing into our community.” Since then, the 44-unit senior residence building remained mostly in its original state. Over the years, normal wear and tear took a toll. Drafty, old windows, walls and roofing resulted in high energy costs and maintenance issues. Teams from BC Housing worked together to complete the building rehabilitation. Building improvements included replacing the entire building exterior.

""Enough is enough with the Little Mountain tragedy that was orchestrated by the previous government that resulted in a low-income community bulldozed, an interest-free loan of hundreds of millions of dollars and a massive empty lot growing weeds in the middle of a housing crisis,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister for Housing. ""We wouldn't be here today if Holborn had not agreed to abandon their court action and release the original contract to the public. That good-faith gesture allowed us to enter into an agreement on timelines they also had no legal obligation to agree to. It's now up to them and Vancouver to actually get this housing open, which will be met with relief by many people across the province. I am hopeful for the first time in a long time about this project."" The MOU outlines the commitment of BC Housing, the City of Vancouver and Holborn to work together to expedite construction of all housing units in development at the Little Mountain site. The non-market housing will be prioritized so it will be complete and ready for occupancy no later than Dec. 31, 2024. ""Today, we are finally moving forward with an expedited plan to build long-awaited and much- needed affordable housing that will mean more of our neighbours can continue to call Vancouver home,"" said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. ""Partnerships like these have been at the centre of record-breaking investments for housing in our city and represent how seriously our current provincial government treats the housing crisis."" As part of the MOU, a planning group will be established to track construction progress and address any issues that might impact the construction schedules of the non-market housing. This group will meet regularly and include a senior representative with decision-making authority from each party. ""The Province and the City of Vancouver continue to do great work in supporting housing affordability and addressing homelessness within our communities,"" said Joo Kim Tiah, principal, Holborn Properties. ""This is exemplified both by the progress made over the past six months in the construction of Little Mountain non-market building 'AC,' and this MOU as a sign of commitment from all parties to proceed expeditiously on the remaining four non-market developments on the site. We look forward to maintaining the positive momentum at Little Mountain as it is progressively redeveloped into a thriving, inclusive and sustainable community."" The Little Mountain redevelopment includes replacing the 224 public housing units that were at the site with 282 new social housing units, including 10 units for the Musqueam Nation.

34,https://news.bchousing.org/private-public-partnership-critical-to-port-moody-housing/,16-08-2021,Private-public partnership critical to Port Moody housing,"Hundreds of affordable rental units. Vast green spaces. Thanks to a partnership between BC Housing and Edgar Development, that’s what Port Moody residents can potentially look forward to. On July 21, Port Moody City Council voted to advance the Woodland Park redevelopment proposal. If the proposal passes the final vote in October, Edgar Development will turn the current site, which contains 200 townhomes built in the 1960s, into more than 2,000 homes. “We’re building a small village,” said Peter Edgar, President of Edgar Development. The redevelopment will offer a mix of strata homes, market rentals, and below-market rentals—that’s where BC Housing comes in. With $140 million in financing, BC Housing will fund the below-market rental component, which includes up to 325 homes. In exchange, Edgar Development will provide five acres of land to BC Housing for free. Brad Foster, Senior Development Manager at BC Housing, said private-public partnerships are key to creating affordable housing. “Edgar came to the table with a valuable and substantial piece of land, which for us is very important because free land decreases the overall cost of what it takes to build affordable housing,” Foster said. “If your costs are too high, it's very difficult to build affordable housing in terms of charging lower rents.” From Edgar Development’s view, the deal means less financial liability and greater opportunity to create affordable housing, an important mission to the real estate firm. “For us to be able to provide the magnitude of true, affordable, secure housing that we wanted to as part of this development, there's no way we could have done it without BC Housing,” Edgar said.   Edgar Development is offering unique benefits to current Woodland Park residents. Typically, when housing gets redeveloped, tenants must relocate during construction. But because Woodland Park will be redeveloped over several phases, tenants will have the option to stay onsite. For current tenants who don’t qualify for affordable housing through the province, Edgar Development is offering units at 20% below-market rent. “These are a couple of the special things we are able to bring to real families, real people who live at Woodland Park today,” Edgar said. The project, which will increase Port Moody’s social-housing supply by 50%, will also attract new residents in need of affordable housing. “The housing will really appeal to the kind of folks living at Woodland Park now. Seniors, working families, younger people looking for their first home,” Foster said. In addition to housing, the redevelopment will have several new amenities. The project includes a grocery store, a 12,000 sq ft childcare facility, and two new public parks, with a general focus on green space. “We've created open green spaces between buildings, and we've put townhomes at the base of every building as well. It's really designed to accommodate families, so when you open your townhome door, you step right onto some green space,” Edgar said. Foster hopes the project will spark more private-public partnerships. “My hope is that it will send signals to other developers,” Foster said, “that if you come to the table in a substantial way with BC Housing, we can really move mountains together.”","Hundreds of affordable rental units.

The subsidy will provide increased affordability and support services for youth between the ages of 18 and 25 who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness, are precariously housed or transitioning to independence. “Young people in our province should always have access to a safe, secure and affordable home,” said Lisa Beare, MLA for Maple-Ridge Pitt Meadows. “The supports and care that will come with these 20 new homes will help vulnerable young people in our community get back on their feet and build a bright future.” Located at 11907 228th St., Cornerstone Landing will provide 94 below-market rental homes for young adults, seniors, individuals and families with low to moderate incomes. Maple Ridge/Pitt Meadows Community Services, an experienced non-profit housing provider, will operate the building and provide youth residents with services that include counselling, advocacy, schooling, life-skills training and health and wellness supports. At least two staff members will be on site seven days a week. Youth will be identified through the Ministry of Children and Family Development or apply for the housing themselves. They do not need to be receiving services from the ministry to qualify. “Many young people face challenges when they transition to adulthood, and this project is an important step to help provide its youth residents with services and supports that they need to thrive,” said Mitzi Dean, Minister for Children and Family Development. “I am thrilled to see this collaboration between community partners and BC Housing.” Construction of Cornerstone Landing is expected to be completed in late fall 2021.

However, the COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need for affordable housing and led to rising levels of homelessness. The Government of Canada created a national strategy to build hundreds of thousands of units and provide affordable housing to people across the country. By continuing to make investments in affordable housing, the government is building stronger communities, creating jobs, and growing our middle class, while fighting homelessness and helping vulnerable Canadians. Adam Vaughan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister Responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), Rob Fleming, MLA for Victoria – Swan Lake & Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure, and Colin Plant, Chair of the Capital Regional District, today announced $11.3 million to create an estimated 46 new affordable homes for individuals and families in the Capital Regional District through the Cities Stream under expanded Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI). These housing units will support Canadians who are in uncertain housing situations, experiencing or at risk of homelessness, or living in temporary shelters because of the pandemic. The B.C. government will support the approved housing projects, when they are identified, with annual operating funding over 20 years. This is in addition to the Government of Canada’s previous investment of $13.1 million through the first phase of the Rapid Housing Initiative to support the creation of 91 housing units in CRD. In its initial round, with funding of $1 billion announced in October 2020, the RHI exceeded its original target of 3,000 permanent affordable housing units and achieved 4,700 units nationally. Due to this success, an additional $1.5 billion for the Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) was recently announced to create 4,500 new units of permanent affordable housing across the country. Thanks to this expansion, this initiative will now create over 9,200 affordable homes for the most vulnerable Canadians across the country. This new investment will create thousands of good jobs in the housing and construction sector, grow the middle class, and build back stronger communities, while getting us closer to our goal of eliminating chronic homelessness in Canada.

This innovative project will include a new 48,500 square foot integrated health center developed and operated by Vancouver Coastal Health. This facility will improve healthcare delivery in the neighborhood and provide easy access to a broad-spectrum of services, including for those in need of specialized mental health and addiction issues, home health, and seniors care. Residents will also benefit from Vancouver Chinatown Foundation’s Community Partners Program – a collective of over 20 businesses and organizations that have already signed on to provide wellness services, life skills training, and accessible cultural experiences. This funding is being delivered through CMHC’s National Housing Co-Investment Fund, a key pillar of the Government of Canada’s National Housing Strategy. Construction will begin in summer 2021 and will be completed in 2024.

Thanks to investments made by the Government of Canada and partners, residents of Coquitlam will now have access to more stable rental housing options. Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), alongside Randeep Sarai, Member of Parliament for Surrey Centre, announced a $109 million low-cost loan to help construct a 308-unit, new residential rental tower located at 551 Emerson St, Coquitlam, BC. This funding is provided through the federal government’s Rental Construction Financing initiative (RCFi), a National Housing Strategy program that supports rental housing construction projects to encourage a stable supply of rental housing for middle-class families in expensive housing markets. Developed by Concert, the 31-storey residential tower is part of a new master-plan community currently under construction that will include a YMCA Community Centre, community police station, strata building, and park as well as other community amenities. The project is transit-focused and located just 150 metres away from the Burquitlam Station on the Evergreen Line Extension of the SkyTrain. Rick Glumac, MLA for Port-Moody-Coquitlam, was also in attendance to announce BC Housing’s $10.6 million contribution through the Community Housing Fund, which will fund the 43 Housing Society’s purchase of 100 units within the tower. The funding will ensure these units have affordable rents for households with low to moderate incomes for at least 60 years from first occupancy. BC Housing will also provide annual operating funding for these 100 homes. Richard Stewart, Mayor of Coquitlam, announced a contribution of a $3.85 million grant to 43 Housing Society. The Government of Canada is working with partners to ensure a range of affordability will be provided for these non-market rents, including homes dedicated to households on income assistance, rent geared to income and at the low end of market.

This is the National Housing Strategy at work.” Randeep Sarai, Member of Parliament for Surrey Centre - “We all know that everyone in our region, and across Canada, deserves adequate and affordable housing. Today, our government’s Rental Construction Financing initiative (RCFi) is helping cities in the Lower Mainland like Coquitlam increase its supply of new rental developments.

With these new homes, people with a wide range of incomes will have access to homes with monthly rents they can afford so they can stay close to friends and family.” Richard Stewart, Mayor of Coquitlam - “Coquitlam is proud to be a regional leader in the provision of rental and affordable rental housing through our innovative Housing Affordability Strategy. And one of the cornerstones of that Strategy is the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund, which leverages development funding towards affordable housing projects – such as this one. It is only through all levels of government working together with developers and the non-profit sector that we will truly see solutions to the housing challenges in the Metro Vancouver region.” Brian McCauley, President & CEO, Concert - “Continuing our over 30 year history of delivering and managing rental housing in the Lower Mainland, we’re very pleased to partner with all three levels of government and 43 Housing Society to deliver affordable rental homes in the heart of this inclusive, sustainable new master-planned community in Coquitlam, BC.” Claire MacLean, CEO, SHARE Family & Community Services Society/43 Housing Society - “This project is an example of the fabulous outcomes we can achieve when all levels of government, the charitable sector and for-profit businesses work together to address the current housing crisis.

The funding will ensure these units have affordable rents for households with low to moderate incomes for at least 60 years from first occupancy. BC Housing will also provide annual operating funding for these 100 homes. Richard Stewart, Mayor of Coquitlam, announced a contribution of a $3.85 million grant to 43 Housing Society. The Government of Canada is working with partners to ensure a range of affordability will be provided for these non-market rents, including homes dedicated to households on income assistance, rent geared to income and at the low end of market. Thirty-one dedicated, accessible homes and two adaptable homes will be delivered for those with mobility and/or physical challenges. Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC)​ - “Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. That’s why, through this investment in Coquitlam and others just like it, our government is taking action to not only increase the supply of new rental developments, but to also provide housing options that are closer to jobs, services and amenities that middle-class families in Coquitlam need. This is the National Housing Strategy at work.” Randeep Sarai, Member of Parliament for Surrey Centre - “We all know that everyone in our region, and across Canada, deserves adequate and affordable housing. Today, our government’s Rental Construction Financing initiative (RCFi) is helping cities in the Lower Mainland like Coquitlam increase its supply of new rental developments. When it is complete, this development will offer fresh housing options for families and individuals which are even closer to good jobs, services and amenities in the community.” Rick Glumac, MLA for Port Moody–Coquitlam - “This new project is welcome news for families and seniors in Coquitlam who are being forced to look at housing outside of their community due to a tight rental market. With these new homes, people with a wide range of incomes will have access to homes with monthly rents they can afford so they can stay close to friends and family.” Richard Stewart, Mayor of Coquitlam - “Coquitlam is proud to be a regional leader in the provision of rental and affordable rental housing through our innovative Housing Affordability Strategy. And one of the cornerstones of that Strategy is the Affordable Housing Reserve Fund, which leverages development funding towards affordable housing projects – such as this one. It is only through all levels of government working together with developers and the non-profit sector that we will truly see solutions to the housing challenges in the Metro Vancouver region.” Brian McCauley, President & CEO, Concert - “Continuing our over 30 year history of delivering and managing rental housing in the Lower Mainland, we’re very pleased to partner with all three levels of government and 43 Housing Society to deliver affordable rental homes in the heart of this inclusive, sustainable new master-planned community in Coquitlam, BC.” Claire MacLean, CEO, SHARE Family & Community Services Society/43 Housing Society - “This project is an example of the fabulous outcomes we can achieve when all levels of government, the charitable sector and for-profit businesses work together to address the current housing crisis. This project will make a massive difference in lives of so many, and 43 Housing Society is looking forward to welcoming our newest residents’ home.” Facts: Mikaela HarrisonPress SecretaryOffice of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Developmentmikaela.harrison@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca Canada Mortgage and Housing CorporationMedia Relationsmedia@cmhc-schl.gc.ca"

At a construction site in Vanderhoof, crews construct housing for seniors and people living with dementia. The 28-unit building, operated by Connexus Community Resources Society, will provide 20 units to seniors and eight to dementia care patients. This living model has not been done in any other public housing in BC. “This unique housing project will bridge the gap in seniors housing and those who need assisted living in long-term care,” said Tyrell Arnold, Executive Director of Connexus Community Resources Society. The housing project started when Arnold talked with Dr. Nicole Ebert of St John Hospital. Dr. Ebert told Arnold the hospital usually had six to eight dementia patients who were stuck there because they had no where to go. Dr. Ebert presented the initiative to the District of Vanderhoof Mayor and Council, who then teamed up with Northern Health and Connexus. They evaluated housing models from other areas in Canada and the UK and settled on a seniors and dementia care model from Nova Scotia. The project is much needed in Vanderhoof. The Connexus waiting list for housing has grown to around 40 people. “Some of the increased demand is caused by seniors who are moving from rural areas to urban areas. Others move because of the death of a spouse, while others are seeking to downsize,” Arnold said. “We already have 10 people who have called us asking to book a home in the new building once it is complete.” The District of Vanderhoof was also thinking about how to address some of the housing challenges facing their community. When the project was presented to the Mayor and council, they quickly came on board and donated land, located on 2657 Church Ave. “Many seniors ended up staying in our local hospital for over two years because we did not have housing for them,” said Gerry Thiessen, Mayor of Vanderhoof. “Northern Health did some research and found the unique housing for seniors and for people living with dementia. We then talked to BC Housing who provided their funding support and we supported Connexus Community Resources Society to be the operator.” Thiessen added that the project will bring stability to families who care for elderly parents. The housing will also bring dignity to the seniors as they will have their own self-contained homes in their community. The construction project has also been good to the local economy, Thiessen said. “Some local tradespeople have found jobs working for the project, local businesses have found contracts and local motels are providing accommodation to nonlocal workers.” Thiessen thanked BC Housing, Northern Health, and Connexus for collaborating with the District of Vanderhoof on this seniors and dementia care housing project. “This innovative project will help more seniors live independently in their community, and provide additional capacity for dementia care,” said James Simpson, NH health services administrator for the Omineca region. “Northern Health is happy to be working with BC Housing and community partners to increase care options for people in their home communities.” So far, construction is steady. The foundation is complete, and crews are now putting up walls. It is expected to be ready for move-in at the end of 2021.","Hammers bang and drills buzz.

The COVID-19 crisis has made it clear that affordable housing is key to Canada’s recovery for regions across the country, including right here in Vancouver. Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), alongside the Honourable David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing, announced details of an approximately $9 million federal investment through the Project Stream of the Rapid Housing Initiative (RHI) for the acquisition of the existing two-storey Deluxe Hotel located in East Vancouver. The building will be renovated and reopened as supportive housing for Indigenous residents, providing a much-needed additional option for Indigenous Peoples experiencing homelessness in the community to access safe and secure housing with culturally appropriate supports services. These 24 homes will be part of a cost-effective housing build located at 3505 Kingsway, for Indigenous Peoples. The central Kingsway location is in close proximity to a wide variety of retail amenities, is within walking distance to the nearest Skytrain station, and the Translink bus service is readily available on Kingsway. Lu’ma Native Housing Society, a non-profit housing provider, will own and operate the homes. Renovations to the building will begin immediately and are anticipated to complete by early 2022. Once operational, Lu’ma will have staff on site 24/7 to provide support services to residents including daily meals, Indigenous cultural programming, skills building and connection to volunteer or employment opportunities. Delivered by CMHC, under the National Housing Strategy (NHS), RHI provides capital contributions to develop new, permanent affordable housing by covering costs associated with modular multi-unit rental construction; conversion of non-residential to affordable multi-residential homes; and, rehabilitation of buildings in disrepair and/or abandoned to affordable multi-residential homes. Investments made under the RHI are expected to support thousands of construction-related jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation – “Our Government is helping ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Our investments will go a long way to effectively support those who need it most by quickly providing new affordable housing units to vulnerable individuals in Vancouver, while addressing the unique barriers faced by at-risk communities. The Rapid Housing Initiative has been a tremendous success — that’s why through Budget 2021, we will increase our total program funding to $2.5 billion in order to rapidly build much-needed affordable homes across Canada. This is the National Housing Strategy at work.” Hedy Fry, Member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre – “We are working hard to ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Building rapid housing in major urban centres like Vancouver, and addressing the specific needs and challenges that municipalities face in the housing sector, is a crucial and necessary step our government has taken to end chronic homelessness. This housing is desperately needed in our community and across Vancouver.” David Eby, Attorney General of British Columbia and Minister Responsible for Housing – “These new homes will help Indigenous peoples experiencing homelessness in Vancouver begin their recovery journey, surrounded by the cultural supports that can make a life changing difference. We know that the struggle to find an affordable home can be even greater for Indigenous peoples who are overwhelmingly overrepresented among people in B.C. experiencing homelessness. It is unacceptable and why we will continue to work with our partners — at the federal, municipal, and community levels — to create the types of homes that are urgently needed in communities across B.C.” Kennedy Stewart, Mayor of Vancouver – “When excellent non-profit operators like Lu’ma Native Housing Society are given the resources to provide supportive, culturally appropriate housing for Indigenous Peoples, we all benefit. I can't thank the Government of Canada and the Province of B.C. enough for their continued partnership to help make sure more of our neighbours have a safe, supportive home to call their own and build a stronger path forward.” Kent Patenaude, President, Lu’ma Native Housing Society– “We are appreciative of our partners who have made this procurement a reality and are thrilled to be welcoming 24 Indigenous residents into these supportive housing units. Residents will be provided with a warm meal, support staff and access to a variety of culturally appropriate wrap around services. This is a great location close to transit and other amenities. I would like to thank my fellow board members for their ongoing support and service.” Quick facts: Learn more: Contacts: Mikaela HarrisonPress SecretaryOffice of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Developmentmikaela.harrison@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca Leonard CatlingMedia RelationsCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporationlcatling@cmhc-schl.gc.ca BC HousingMedia Relationsmedia@bchousing.org","VANCOUVER - Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home.

Once operational, Lu’ma will have staff on site 24/7 to provide support services to residents including daily meals, Indigenous cultural programming, skills building and connection to volunteer or employment opportunities. Delivered by CMHC, under the National Housing Strategy (NHS), RHI provides capital contributions to develop new, permanent affordable housing by covering costs associated with modular multi-unit rental construction; conversion of non-residential to affordable multi-residential homes; and, rehabilitation of buildings in disrepair and/or abandoned to affordable multi-residential homes. Investments made under the RHI are expected to support thousands of construction-related jobs for Canadians from coast to coast to coast. Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation – “Our Government is helping ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Our investments will go a long way to effectively support those who need it most by quickly providing new affordable housing units to vulnerable individuals in Vancouver, while addressing the unique barriers faced by at-risk communities. The Rapid Housing Initiative has been a tremendous success — that’s why through Budget 2021, we will increase our total program funding to $2.5 billion in order to rapidly build much-needed affordable homes across Canada. This is the National Housing Strategy at work.” Hedy Fry, Member of Parliament for Vancouver Centre – “We are working hard to ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Building rapid housing in major urban centres like Vancouver, and addressing the specific needs and challenges that municipalities face in the housing sector, is a crucial and necessary step our government has taken to end chronic homelessness. This housing is desperately needed in our community and across Vancouver.” David Eby, Attorney General of British Columbia and Minister Responsible for Housing – “These new homes will help Indigenous peoples experiencing homelessness in Vancouver begin their recovery journey, surrounded by the cultural supports that can make a life changing difference. We know that the struggle to find an affordable home can be even greater for Indigenous peoples who are overwhelmingly overrepresented among people in B.C. experiencing homelessness. It is unacceptable and why we will continue to work with our partners — at the federal, municipal, and community levels — to create the types of homes that are urgently needed in communities across B.C.” Kennedy Stewart, Mayor of Vancouver – “When excellent non-profit operators like Lu’ma Native Housing Society are given the resources to provide supportive, culturally appropriate housing for Indigenous Peoples, we all benefit. I can't thank the Government of Canada and the Province of B.C. enough for their continued partnership to help make sure more of our neighbours have a safe, supportive home to call their own and build a stronger path forward.” Kent Patenaude, President, Lu’ma Native Housing Society– “We are appreciative of our partners who have made this procurement a reality and are thrilled to be welcoming 24 Indigenous residents into these supportive housing units. Residents will be provided with a warm meal, support staff and access to a variety of culturally appropriate wrap around services. This is a great location close to transit and other amenities. I would like to thank my fellow board members for their ongoing support and service.” Learn more: Mikaela HarrisonPress SecretaryOffice of the Minister of Families, Children and Social Developmentmikaela.harrison@hrsdc-rhdcc.gc.ca Leonard CatlingMedia RelationsCanada Mortgage and Housing Corporationlcatling@cmhc-schl.gc.ca BC"

""This project is an example of our experiments with new models to offer affordability to British Columbians,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""In addition to being an experiment in affordability, this building will mean more homes for those living in Victoria and will support middle-income buyers to own their first home."" Located at 1301 Hillside Ave., the six-storey building will have 49 homes, with a mix of studio, one-bedroom, junior two-bedroom and two-bedroom units. Nine of these units will be reserved for families, seniors and individuals with middle incomes. Buyers will receive a no- interest, no-monthly-payment second mortgage to support their purchase. This second participating mortgage assists the buyer on the equity portion of their purchase, helping reduce the income required to obtain a first mortgage and its monthly payments. Qualifying buyers must have a combined household income no greater than $116,330 for the units with fewer than two bedrooms and an income no greater than $163,220 for the two- bedroom units. The remaining 40 units will be sold at market value. The nine affordable homes are being built in partnership with Abstract Developments through BC Housing's Affordable Home Ownership Program (AHOP). The program was created to allow BC Housing to partner with the development community and municipalities throughout the province and create new home ownership opportunities for middle-income households. AHOP's goal is to garner savings through low-cost financing or waiving of fees from the partnership and pass those savings onto potential purchasers in the form of second participating equity mortgages that are interest- and monthly-payment free for up to 25 years for qualified buyers. BC Housing is not financing this project, but will administer the second mortgages for the nine AHOP units. Buyers do not need to repay the mortgages until the 25-year term limit expires or if they choose to sell their home. At the time of repayment, the homeowner must repay the proportionate share of the current market value of the home. For example, if the home was purchased with a 10% AHOP mortgage, the homeowner must repay 10% of the current fair market value at the time of repayment. Construction is expected to be completed by spring 2023. Quotes: Rob Fleming, MLA for Victoria-Swan Lake - ""No one should have to leave the community they call home because they can't find an affordable place to live.

The sale will be finalized when construction is complete this summer. Named Turnock Manor, the project includes a four-storey building, which will provide a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom homes, and a two-unit, fully furbished heritage house. There are also 70 underground parking stalls on site. “Securing these rental homes is an example of how our government is working to make sure everyone in the community has a secure and affordable place to call their own,” said Bob D’Eith, MLA for Maple Ridge-Mission. “We know there is more work to do, but we are making progress with nearly 350 homes open or underway in Maple Ridge.” The Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), is providing $6.6 million as part of the 10-year bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy between the Government of Canada and the Province of British Columbia, which will ensure these new homes stay affordable for people in the community. “Our government is committed to ensuring that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home,” said Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for CMHC. “Long-term, predictable funding for housing has been needed for more than a decade. This project is receiving support through the bilateral agreement under the National Housing Strategy and brings us one step closer to our goal of building strong communities where Canadians can prosper and thrive, now and for the future.” These new homes will be available to households with annual incomes ranging between approximately $28,400 and $68,600. Monthly rents will vary depending on unit size and tenant income. Quotes: Ron McKinnon, MP for Coquitlam-Port Coquitlam – “Affordable, stable housing is an immediate necessity in Maple Ridge and across the Lower Mainland. The COVID-19 pandemic has shown us that we need to respond rapidly to support individuals, families and those most vulnerable in our community.

""These homes will provide the foundation that people experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack need to move indoors and begin their recovery with dignity,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""With this purchase, we are continuing to add to the significant efforts underway with community and local government partners in Chilliwack to tackle the housing crisis and build the homes people urgently need."" The former hotel, located at 45466 Yale Rd., has 82 units, each with their own washroom, kitchenette and storage space. Ruth and Naomi's Mission, an experienced non-profit housing operator, will manage the building. Staff will be on-site 24/7 and will provide residents with supports such as daily meals, mentorship, life skill training, wellness checks and referrals to health services. Since April 2020, BC Housing has been leasing 44 rooms at the hotel as temporary housing for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. By purchasing the hotel, the residents will be able to remain in the building, while the remaining units will be available for other people experiencing homelessness in the community. Ruth and Naomi's Oasis Residential Addictions Treatment Services Program will also be moved to this site. Twenty rooms will be designated to the program, which provides recovery services for people who are ready to address personal challenges regarding addiction and mental health. The treatment program was previously based out of Ruth and Naomi's Margaret Avenue location. This move will free up space at the Margaret Avenue shelter to accommodate guests from The Portal shelter, which is set to close on July 15, 2021. While the Travelodge site is not currently zoned for use as supportive housing, the City of Chilliwack is allowing operation of the building on a temporary basis due to the pandemic. In the coming months, BC Housing intends to submit a proposal to the city to rezone the site, with the intention of securing these much-needed supportive homes for permanent use.

""These homes will provide the foundation that people experiencing homelessness in Chilliwack need to move indoors and begin their recovery with dignity,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""With this purchase, we are continuing to add to the significant efforts underway with community and local government partners in Chilliwack to tackle the housing crisis and build the homes people urgently need."" The former hotel, located at 45466 Yale Rd., has 82 units, each with their own washroom, kitchenette and storage space. Ruth and Naomi's Mission, an experienced non-profit housing operator, will manage the building. Staff will be on-site 24/7 and will provide residents with supports such as daily meals, mentorship, life skill training, wellness checks and referrals to health services. Since April 2020, BC Housing has been leasing 44 rooms at the hotel as temporary housing for vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. By purchasing the hotel, the residents will be able to remain in the building, while the remaining units will be available for other people experiencing homelessness in the community. Ruth and Naomi's Oasis Residential Addictions Treatment Services Program will also be moved to this site. Twenty rooms will be designated to the program, which provides recovery services for people who are ready to address personal challenges regarding addiction and mental health. The treatment program was previously based out of Ruth and Naomi's Margaret Avenue location. This move will free up space at the Margaret Avenue shelter to accommodate guests from The Portal shelter, which is set to close on July 15, 2021. While the Travelodge site is not currently zoned for use as supportive housing, the City of Chilliwack is allowing operation of the building on a temporary basis due to the pandemic. In the coming months, BC Housing intends to submit a proposal to the city to rezone the site, with the intention of securing these much-needed supportive homes for permanent use.

57,https://news.bchousing.org/innovative-affordable-housing-pilot-project-coming-to-vancouver/,07-05-2021,Vienna House pilot project coming to Vancouver,"VANCOUVER - An affordable rental housing pilot project is underway in Vancouver that will help BC Housing evaluate innovative building materials and designs aimed at tackling affordability, inclusion and climate change. The project, called Vienna House, is in the initial design phase. It will be proposed as a six-storey building with approximately 100 units at the intersection of Victoria Drive and Stainsbury Avenue in East Vancouver. The project is a partnership between BC Housing, the City of Vancouver (through the Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency), and More Than a Roof Housing Society. ""In responding to our housing crisis and the climate crisis, there's lots of work to do,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""Vienna House is part of how we are taking action. Responding to the housing crisis with 100 units and the climate crisis with high energy efficiency, this project will allow BC Housing to test different approaches to prefabrication, building information modeling and integrated design. Our goal remains building affordable, healthy and sustainable homes quickly and efficiently, and Vienna House will be part of the solution."" Vienna House will showcase innovative materials and processes designed to deliver high- energy performance with very low greenhouse gas emissions. This includes exploring prefabricated building components made from renewable materials and an integrated design process that brings all partners together at regular intervals to solve project challenges and maximize opportunities for efficiency. This building would provide rental homes for a range of households, including low- to moderate-income individuals, families, seniors and those facing accessibility barriers. The Vancouver Affordable Housing Agency and Vancouver's Public: Architecture + Communication are creating the initial design concept for Vienna House and moving it through the rezoning process. The application to the City of Vancouver for rezoning is expected to be submitted in summer 2021. If approved, the project would be built to meet the requirements of the Passive House standard. As a result, future tenants would use very little energy for heating and cooling and, in compliance with the City of Vancouver's Zero Emissions Building Plan, the building would be designed to minimize climate pollution. If approved, the project would welcome its first tenants in late 2023, at which point ownership and management would be transferred to the More Than a Roof Housing Society. The Urban Innovation Research Group at the University of British Columbia's (UBC) Sustainability Initiative would study Vienna House in depth, from start to finish, to ensure the project creates a wealth of evidence to inform construction best practices and policy development. The Vienna House project is also the signature piece of a collaboration between the City of Vancouver and the City of Vienna, Austria, to explore new materials and approaches to building affordable housing. A similar project, called Vancouver House, will be built in Austria while Vienna House is underway.

Each of the units would have their own washroom and kitchenette. “Council is grateful to the Province, BC Housing and Northern Health for their ongoing partnership with the City of Prince George,” said Lyn Hall, mayor, City of Prince George. “The commitment of an additional 50 units of modular housing will further enhance our collective efforts to ensure vulnerable residents with complex needs are able to access supported housing and critical health-care services. The 1st Avenue project is the result of much hard work and collaboration and we look forward to seeing it develop and benefit our residents.” A development permit application has been submitted to the city. If approved, construction of the 50-unit project is anticipated to begin in spring 2021. The rezoning process has been completed.

Located at 225 Russell St., the building is undergoing renovations to improve the site's ability to operate as a temporary shelter and provide wraparound supports for residents. Residents will move into the building before the end of April once renovations are completed. ""In order to hit our target of bringing everyone in tents in parks in Victoria inside by the end of April, this building is a necessary part of the plan,"" said David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing. ""While this purchase helps us reach our initial goal of dignified shelter by the end of next month, the site will also support our work to deliver stable, safe, long-term homes for people living in parks in Victoria when it is ultimately redeveloped."" This purchase is part of the commitment between the Province and City of Victoria to move more than 200 people currently living in encampments indoors by April 30, 2021.

Staff will provide residents with access and referral to health and wellness programs. The temporary shelter will remain open for 18 months and, if needed, may be extended for an additional six months. Following its use as a temporary shelter, BC Housing will engage the community on a redevelopment proposal for supportive housing, which will follow the municipal rezoning process.

61,https://news.bchousing.org/new-affordable-homes-open-in-whistler/,26-03-2021,New Affordable Homes Open in Whistler,"WHISTLER - Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home. Today, the Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), along with David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing announced details of a total investment of $25.1 million dollars for the recently completed Granite Ridge project in Whistler. Of this amount, $4.5 million is through the BC Priorities Housing Initiative grant – an initiative under the Canada–British Columbia Bilateral Agreement on housing. The B.C. government, through BC Housing’s HousingHub, provided low-cost construction financing of approximately $10.2 million, which helped reduce the cost of the project for the Whistler Housing Authority. The final portion of this funding, $10.4 million, is being provided by the Government of Canada through the National Housing Co-Investment Fund (NHCF). This project is a partnership between the Government of Canada, through Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC), the Province of B.C. through BC Housing, the Whistler Housing Authority, and the Resort Municipality of Whistler. Located at 1330 Cloudburst Dr., the project provides 45 affordable rental homes for people for who work in Whistler. More than 100 residents are moving into the three-storey building, which includes 12 studio units, 12 one-bedroom units, 17 two-bedroom units and four three-bedroom units. Monthly rents are set well below the local average market rental rate. Managed by Whistler Housing Authority, the project is helping to address the need for workforce housing in the community. Whistler has a high percentage of workforce employed in the resort’s service industry. Based on a recent housing assessment, the greatest need in the area is for additional affordable studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units that would provide rental relief for the workforce, particularly for young adults in the community. Whistler Housing Authority has also partnered with Zero Ceiling, a non-profit organization in Whistler committed to ending youth homelessness, to provide a stable, secure, affordable three-bedroom rental unit for marginalized young adults working in Whistler. Quotes: The Honourable Ahmed Hussen, Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) - “Our Government is taking steps, right now, to ensure that every Canadian has a safe and affordable place to call home. Our investments will go a long way to support those who need it most by quickly providing new affordable housing units to vulnerable individuals and families. Our Government’s plan under the National Housing Strategy continues to provide housing for Canadians from coast to coast to coast, including in right here in Whistler.” David Eby, Attorney General and Minister Responsible for Housing - “We know that people are struggling to find affordable housing, which is forcing them to commute from further and further away. These new rental homes will help give people working in Whistler the ability to live where they work. Through partnerships like this, we are building the homes that people need to stay in their community.” Patrick Weiler, Member of Parliament for West Vancouver – Sunshine Coast – Sea to Sky Country - “Today’s announcement shows what is possible when there is a commitment of all orders of government to work together. The result is Granite Ridge, which is now providing 45 safe, affordable workforce housing units in Whistler. Addressing our affordable housing challenge, and ensuring that the people that work in Whistler can afford to live in Whistler would also not have been possible without the local leadership of the Whistler Housing Authority.” Jack Crompton, Mayor of Whistler - “The Resort Municipality of Whistler is grateful to the Province, BC Housing, CMHC and our housing partners for this critical investment in Whistler and in our community members. Access to affordable, resident housing is not only the foundation that supports our local economy, itis a critical contributor to our community vitality, diversity and connection. We are thrilled to see Granite Ridge transition from a building into a home for over 100 locals.” “Marla Zucht, General Manager, Whistler Housing Authority - The Whistler Housing Authority is very appreciative to have received funding and support from both BC Housing and CMHC for Whistler’s newest affordable housing. Whistler is committed to actively confronting housing affordability in our community through the creation of affordable housing that is price and occupancy restricted for the local workforce. Over the last 20 years, the Whistler Housing Authority has partnered with all three levels of government, as well as the private sector, to create and maintain an inventory of 6,600 beds of affordable housing within Whistler.” Melissa Pace, CEO, Whistler Chamber of Commerce - “Advocating for affordable housing solutions remains a top priority for the Whistler Chamber of Commerce. On behalf of our Members and the broader Whistler business community, we would like to thank the Government of British Columbia, the BC Housing Association and the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation for recognizing the challenges we face in Whistler, and supporting the community's ongoing effort to secure affordable housing for Whistler’s workforce. This funding will assist in the retention of permanent employees, who are vital to the mid and long-term recovery of our resort’s economy.” Sean East, Co-Executive Director, Zero Ceiling - “We’re excited to begin this new partnership with the Whistler Housing Authority, which offers vulnerable young people an incredible opportunity to find stability, opportunities, and community in Whistler. It’s great to see the community offer a broader range of housing on the housing continuum by empowering us to provide more supportive housing in Whistler.

The two-storey building also has a medical room, laundry, administrative and counselling space, lounge, dining room and commercial kitchen. Queen Charlotte Heritage Housing Society is managing the housing. Staff will provide residents with wraparound support services, including meal programs and life-skills training, as well as health referrals and wellness checks. A staff member will be on site 24-7. BC Housing and the society have worked together to identify those who are experiencing homelessness in the community, evaluated their support needs and developed a support plan to prepare them as they move into their new homes. The Province provided approximately $8.5 million in capital funding from the Building BC: Supportive Housing Fund for the building and is providing $469,000 in annual operating funding. The land for the project was transferred from the Province to BC Housing. This was done in consultation with the Haida Nation. Residents started moving into the new building on March 22, 2021. Quotes: Jennifer Rice, MLA for North Coast – “This project, with the support and wraparound services it provides, centres dignity and stability for people experiencing homelessness.

Previously known as the Home Adaptations for Independence (HAFI) program, the BC Rebate for Accessible Home Adaptations (BC RAHA) program features a number of changes including, but not limited to: removing the need to obtain a quote for standard accessibility adaptations; ensuring more equitable access to funding by region and type of home adaptation; and increasing access to occupational therapists or other qualified professionals for assessments. ""The relaunched BC RAHA program will help more seniors and persons with disabilities cover the costs of adaptations to their homes,"" said Dan Coulter, Parliamentary Secretary for Accessibility. ""In addition to making the disbursement of funds more equitable, the announced improvements also include a streamlined application process and additional support resources to make the process easier for all applicants."" Previously, applicants were required to obtain a quote for all accessibility adaptations. By removing the need for a quote for standard accessibility adaptions, applications and approvals will be streamlined, and the home adaptations can occur faster. With set rebate amounts for common adaptations based on average costs, there will be greater transparency in terms of what amount of funding the applicant can expect to receive. This will also help ensure there are no significant discrepancies in funding for similar adaptations among applicants. To ensure the adaptations accurately address applicants' medical needs, and that any other needs they may have are appropriately identified, occupational therapists or other qualified professionals will make an assessment for some adaptations. This new requirement supports the medical needs of seniors and people with disabilities. Instead of using housing income limits, which vary by unit size and community, a new provincewide income limit will be used, based on the low- and moderate-income limits established annually by BC Housing. The new income limits ensure more equitable access to funding by region, and where the applicant lives will no longer be a determining factor. The BC RAHA program is jointly funded by the provincial and federal governments with an annual budget of $5 million. ""Every Canadian deserves a safe and affordable place to call home,"" said Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation. ""That is why our government is partnering with British Columbia to support the creation of the BC Rebate for Accessible Home Adaptations, so that we continue to move towards our goal of building strong communities where Canadians can prosper and thrive, barrier free, now and for the future.""

The COVID-19 crisis has made it clear that affordable housing is key to Canada’s recovery as major cities across the country including Surrey are dealing with significant challenges around homelessness and housing need.

As part of its Investment Plan for the Major Cities Stream, the City of Surrey is working in partnership with Atira Women’s Resource Society to develop a new modular housing apartment at 9145 King George Boulevard, which will provide approximately 44 new affordable units. Owned and operated by Atira Women’s Resource Society, this supportive housing complex will serve women experiencing and at risk of homelessness, including Indigenous women, trans and two-spirit women, and women who are struggling with substance abuse, mental health and spiritual wellness. The B.C. government will support the new housing with annual operating funding over 20 years. This funding will build off the provincial investments made in Surrey over the last three years, which are supporting the construction of nearly 270 new homes with 24/7 support for people experiencing homelessness. With the $1 billion RHI, the Government of Canada will support the construction of up to 3,000 permanent, new affordable housing units across Canada to help address urgent housing needs for people and populations who are vulnerable. Delivered by CMHC, under the National Housing Strategy (NHS), RHI provides capital contributions to develop new, permanent affordable housing by covering costs associated with modular multi-unit rental construction; conversion of non-residential to affordable multi-residential; and, rehabilitation of buildings in disrepair and/or abandoned to affordable multi-residential.

The building will undergo renovations to accommodate 33 supportive homes for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness, a service hub with six shelter beds, programming space for training/outreach services and a commercial kitchen. The plan is to gradually transition the building into supportive housing over the coming months. The Sooke Shelter society will operate the new building with staff on site 24/7 to provide support services to residents, including life skills training, mentorship and other programming. Partnering agencies, including Island Health and Aids Vancouver Island, will be on site to support residents' access to mental health and other health services. The Hope Centre currently provides rental homes for people with low incomes. M'akola has already reached out to current residents, who will be able to stay if they wish to. The society will work with these residents to discuss their future plans and support those who wish to transition to other housing options. A community advisory committee (CAC) will be formed, which will include project partners and neighbourhood representatives. The CAC will oversee the project's integration within the community and help address any concerns that may arise.

""We know that Skeena Terrace is a vital part of the community, providing hundreds of affordable homes for families and seniors,"" said Niki Sharma, MLA for Vancouver-Hastings. ""I look forward to seeing how we can transform this development, so that people will continue to have a safe and secure place to call home for years to come."" The planning process is in the early stages. As such, there are no plans to relocate Skeena Terrace tenants at this time.

People living at Naomi Place are referred from BC Housing’s Supportive Housing Registry. Priority is given to applicants experiencing homelessness from the surrounding area. Local outreach teams, including staff from Community Builders Group, made sure local people without homes were included in the application process. David, a senior, moved to Naomi Place from a local shelter. Before that he lived in Vancouver’s Stanley Park for over 15 years.

Donations of soap, towels, chocolates and more were collected from the community. Each resident was given a new, blue bag of welcome filled with toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, toilet paper, kitchen towels and more. The local school chipped in too. “Elementary school students took a significant amount of time to write handwritten notes for each resident,” said Roberts. She holds up a brightly coloured welcome card decorated with stars. Inside, the card reads: “Congratulations! May you find great happiness at your new place.

The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room. Residents will arrive in the New Year. Fraserside Community Services Society will operate the housing with supports. It will provide residents with on-site staff and support services 24-7, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities to contribute to the community. In addition, construction is scheduled to start in early 2021 on 40 new supportive homes at 13620 80 Ave. The homes are expected to be complete in summer 2021 and will be operated by Phoenix Drug and Alcohol Recovery and Education Society.

The facility will be modelled after the successful Burdock House supportive housing project that BC Housing opened in October 2019, and which is operated by ASK Wellness Society. Staff will be on site 24/7 to provide supports, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and other offerings like those at Burdock House. While no rezoning is required for the site, BC Housing will conduct two virtual, small-group community dialogue sessions in January 2021 to provide people with information about the development plans and an opportunity for conversation about how to integrate the new housing into the community. As with other projects, once it is closer to completion, BC Housing will set up a community advisory committee so a structure will be in place to support integration, once the site is operating. The supportive housing units are the first phase of the site’s development. The rest of the site will be kept available for future affordable housing projects for people in Penticton, including seniors, singles, families and/or people with a disability. An experienced operator for the project will be confirmed later. Construction is expected to begin in spring 2021 and anticipated to be completed in summer 2022. “This is an important investment for people in the Okanagan,” said Roly Russell, MLA for Boundary-Similkameen. “We know how critical housing is to help so many in our rural communities that are struggling.

Run by Turning Points Collaborative Society (TPCS), the new homes offer safe, secure housing for those experiencing homelessness. Right away, formerly homeless community members settled in. The secret of My Place’s success began in 2018. The staff started interviewing people living in the TPCS-operated bridge housing on 33rd Street. Working with future My Place residents helped the team learn about resident needs for their future homes. “We asked our bridge housing clients questions about their physical health, mental health, survival and communication skill and more, to learn more about what kind of support they would need in their future homes,” said Shelley Kiefiuk, Site Manager for My Place. “By living together at 33rd Street, future My Place residents were able to form their own community before they even got here. The process really brought people together.” Just a year since My Place opened, and the positive impacts to residents and the neighbourhood are clear. A recent TPCS survey showed that 83 percent of residents and businesses are (now) familiar with the supportive housing concept. Another 96 percent state they “like the idea”. Seventy percent report that “the neighbourhood improved in the past year”. Ninety eight percent of local businesses said they would “support more supportive housing in the community.” “You know, my life has changed completely,” says Stefanie, a My Place resident. ""I think I was homeless for close to five years - I've done a complete turnaround. I really feel as though I would've been close to death if I hadn't moved into My Place. I found self-worth, which I never saw in myself before. I wouldn't be doing any of the positive things if I wasn't here. I feel positive about my future. I am grateful for everyone who showed me they cared and for not giving up on me when I wanted to give up on myself.” Cindy Masters is the Executive Director of the Vernon and District Community Land Trust. The non-profit society operates Creekside Village, a seniors’ residence located next door to My Place. “It’s brilliant,” says Masters of My Place. “People were apprehensive at first, but now, everyone is delighted and thinks the new housing is an asset to this part of town. My Place residents are friendly and care about the neighbourhood, and the crime rate has gone down. I think that’s because this beautiful building has people, life and excitement around it. And most important for us, residents of our building and theirs are becoming friends with each other. Some people had an idea in their head about what My Place would be - and they were proven wrong. Overall, the community is really excited about new supportive housing in Vernon.” Shelley Kiefiuk believes the project has been a success due to community outreach and education. “It’s really important to communicate with your neighbours and be responsive,” said Kiefiuk. Many people don’t know about supportive housing or understand what it is. We have open, honest conversations about what supportive housing is, what it looks like, what the intent is. When we have these kinds of conversations, what we hear back from the community is that we need more of this kind of housing.

And so, that shows in how this project is coming together,” said George Gabara, Superintendent, Kinetic Construction."" In May 2020, construction started on four 650-quare foot, one-bedroom cottages on Cortes Island. The cottages will soon be affordable rental homes for seniors. “The new cottages are really sweet,” said Sandra Wood, Housing Project Coordinator, Cortes Island Seniors Society. “They're small, cozy, and sharing a courtyard garden with our existing six cottages.” The Cortes Island Seniors Village provides accessible homes for low- to moderate-income seniors. Located at 951 Beasley Road, the housing project consists of one-level, wood framed cottages. Six are already in place. The two new cabins and a new duplex mean four more seniors will soon have a place to call home. The homes are rent-geared-to-income. This means 30 per cent of a tenant’s income goes towards rent. Rents average about $535 per month depending on the resident’s actual income. The multi-coloured cottages are made up of a bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, living and dining area, and outdoor patio with an accessible exterior locker for extra storage. The central courtyard and garden, along with the quiet forested setting, offer the tranquility of nature. All within easy walking distance to the Health Centre, Museum, Community Hall and shops in Mansons Landing. The Cortes Island Seniors Society owns and operates the buildings. The Province of BC gave a grant of $400,000 from the Building BC: Community Housing Fund for the four new cottages, and about $1 million in construction financing and annual operating funds from BC Housing. The society gave the land and $100,000 cash from donations from the Cortes community and other funders. The four new cottages should be finished by the end of 2020.

Shared amenities in each wing include a laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together. The building also has a medical room to provide on-site care for residents. The Lower Post First Nation Housing Society will manage the building and provide residents with support services, such as daily meals, wellness supports and referrals to health services. In addition, residents will have access to teachings from Elders and programming that focuses on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7. “Thank you, BC Housing, for this new affordable housing,” said Chief Harlan Schilling, Chief Councillor, Daylu Dena Council. “So many of us see the need for affordable housing that has been talked about for many years. BC Housing is living up to its mission of developing safe, permanently affordable housing for people in northern B.C. Thank you. It will help the community of Lower Post to meet our needs now and will be there for future generations.” This project is located further north than any project BC Housing has ever built and is the first development in climate zone 8. The remote community has a population of approximately 170 people. Access to services is difficult. Due to the shortage of appropriate housing, some members of the Daylu Dena Nation are living elsewhere in the region and are interested in returning to the community when adequate housing is available. The land on which the housing will be built is owned by The North West Company. It will be leased to BC Housing at $1 per year for 30 years and is renewable on the same terms at its expiry. “North West is pleased to have been given the opportunity to play a role in this important project,” said Mike Beaulieu, vice -president of Canadian store operations for The North West Company. “Shortage of affordable housing in Indigenous communities is a problem we see across Canada. We are excited to be able to contribute the land that will enable construction of 16 new homes and look forward to seeing the positive outcomes this project will have on the community.” Construction is anticipated to be complete in fall 2021.

101,https://news.bchousing.org/new-supportive-homes-for-indigenous-women-open-in-victoria/,31-07-2020,New supportive homes for Indigenous women open in Victoria,"VICTORIA – The Province has partnered with the Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness Society to open 21 new supportive homes for Indigenous women who are experiencing or at risk of homelessness in Victoria. “Housing is the foundation on which people build their lives, and everyone in our community deserves a safe and secure home,” said Rob Fleming, MLA for Victoria-Swan Lake. “With the help of our partners, this housing with wraparound supports will provide urgently needed homes for Indigenous women in the community, surrounded by their tradition and culture.” Located at 833 Hillside Ave., Spaken House, also known as Flower House, is a modular two-storey apartment building with 21 self-contained units, each with a private washroom and mini kitchen. Shared amenities include an office, laundry room, commercial kitchen and a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together. The Aboriginal Coalition to End Homelessness Society (ACEH) will operate the building and will have staff on site 24/7 to support residents. This project is the first supportive housing of its kind in British Columbia. It provides culturally appropriate supports for Indigenous women, as well as access to teachings from Elders, traditional foods, cultural crafts and land-based healing, including programming that focuses on physical, mental, emotional and spiritual well-being. In addition, an Elder and an “Aunty” will be onsite two days per week to provide additional one-on-one support. “Everyone at every level has done their part to make this a reality – Spaken House is beautiful,” said Fran Hunt-Jinnouchi, executive director, ACEH. “The Aboriginal Coalition team will work diligently to ensure the environment is safe, builds on a sense of family and community and incorporates pathways to healing and recovery into the programming. Most importantly, we will celebrate the gifts the women bring to our Family Circle and support them in their journey through culture, crafts, healing ceremonies, family reunification, a meal program including traditional foods, empowerment workshops, Elder support and much more."" Additional unique features to Spaken House include a therapeutic garden with plants and natural medicines, which will serve as a resource for healing and well-being. “As we prepare to enter into Spaken House, my heart feels full to have witnessed this become a reality for the women moving in soon,” said Gloria Roze, Elder, ACEH. “Our people have been needing this for a long time and I hope it leads to more amazing housing successes. I have seen land-based healing work for our people in positive and profound ways. Culturally supportive housing is a pathway for the spirit and internal growth. You feel the love when you step into Spaken.” Atira Women’s Resource Society, an experienced non-profit housing provider, helped provide supports and training to ACEH staff in creating this unique program.“Atira has had the absolute privilege to work with the ACEH, its dedicated executive director and amazing team, as they embark on this critically important, culturally relevant, supportive housing program for First Nations, Métis and Inuit women,” said Janice Abbott, CEO, Atira. “We are grateful for the small part we have played in making this happen and look forward to working together into the future, strengthening our relationship in support of both the ACEH and the women it serves.” Residents will begin moving into their new homes in mid-August 2020. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The first development, located at 2600 35 St., would add 52 new homes with supports to the existing My Place, a 52-unit supportive housing building that TPCS has been operating since July 2019. The property is owned by BC Housing and is already zoned for use, but will need to go through the municipal approval process. The second development, located at 2307 43 St., would demolish the derelict Howard House shelter, which has long been slated for redevelopment, and build approximately 50 units of new supportive housing. The site is connected to Our Place, a 46-bed supportive housing building that TPCS has operated since March 2019. BC Housing will purchase the site from TPCS, which requires approval from the City of Vernon to be rezoned. The property is currently vacant. ""We are grateful to all our community partners, especially BC Housing and the City of Vernon,” said Randene Wejr, executive director, TPCS. “Together, we have already created homes for 56 individuals who were once experiencing homelessness. The proposed projects ahead will create more than 100 more homes. The strength of any community can be witnessed in how it takes care of its most vulnerable citizens, today we get to witness that great strength in Vernon."" TPCS would operate both buildings and provide residents with meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services. If the projects are approved by the city, BC Housing will update the community with the estimated project costs and proposed construction timelines. Funding would come from the Province’s Supportive Housing Fund. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The first development, located at 2600 35 St., would add 52 new homes with supports to the existing My Place, a 52-unit supportive housing building that TPCS has been operating since July 2019. The property is owned by BC Housing and is already zoned for use, but will need to go through the municipal approval process. The second development, located at 2307 43 St., would demolish the derelict Howard House shelter, which has long been slated for redevelopment, and build approximately 50 units of new supportive housing. The site is connected to Our Place, a 46-bed supportive housing building that TPCS has operated since March 2019. BC Housing will purchase the site from TPCS, which requires approval from the City of Vernon to be rezoned. The property is currently vacant. ""We are grateful to all our community partners, especially BC Housing and the City of Vernon,” said Randene Wejr, executive director, TPCS. “Together, we have already created homes for 56 individuals who were once experiencing homelessness. The proposed projects ahead will create more than 100 more homes. The strength of any community can be witnessed in how it takes care of its most vulnerable citizens, today we get to witness that great strength in Vernon."" TPCS would operate both buildings and provide residents with meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services. If the projects are approved by the city, BC Housing will update the community with the estimated project costs and proposed construction timelines. Funding would come from the Province’s Supportive Housing Fund. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The building has been recently renovated and has a shared kitchen, dining area, storage and amenity space, and a dedicated supportive services suite for on-site staff. Youth will begin moving in fall 2020. People living in the building will be youth between the ages of 16 and 24 who are homeless or at-risk of homelessness, precariously housed or transitioning out of care. “This new housing for youth is an important step to help them achieve their dreams and build the future they want and deserve,” said Katrine Conroy, Minister of Children and Family Development. “Ministry staff will be on hand to help youth access the resources they need and provide them with the right tools and supports so they can get back on their feet.” Cyrus Centre, an experienced non-profit housing provider, will operate the new supportive housing and provide residents with services that include meals, clothing, advocacy, schooling, counselling and life-skills training. Many youth experiencing homelessness are leaving situations of abuse, poverty, exploitation and drugs. Cyrus Centre works to meet the individual needs of each youth, offering programs and services to guide and equip them for success and enhance their quality of life. At least two staff members will be on site 24/7. “Cyrus Centre is thrilled with the purchase of the Mellard Avenue property and recognizes this would not have been possible without the support of BC Housing, the mayor, council and City of Chilliwack staff,” said Les Talvio, executive director, Cyrus Centre. “Once again, Chilliwack is setting the standard for other communities to follow. This property will allow for youth to overcome barriers to housing and develop the skills necessary for success.” Residents will be identified through the Ministry of Children and Family Development or self-referred. However, they do not need to be receiving services from the ministry to qualify. “Chilliwack’s Homelessness Action Plan first identified the need for additional supportive youth housing in 2016, recognizing that youth experiencing homelessness are some of the most vulnerable members of our society,” said Ken Popove, mayor, City of Chilliwack. “We are pleased to support the Province’s investment in our community and look forward to seeing the building open to its new residents.” Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government, the BC Green Party caucus and Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The new rental homes are designed to be affordable for households with annual incomes between $44,000 and $76,000. The projects will have studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes. Monthly rents will range from $1,100 for a studio to $1,900 for a three- bedroom unit.

The Province, through BC Housing, is providing $1.5 million in construction financing to the society to convert three commercial units in the building into the eight new homes. “In Sooke, we know that where and how people live affects the well-being and character of our entire community,” said Maja Tait, mayor, District of Sooke. “These new affordable rental homes reflect our long-standing approach to affordable housing, one that not only helps renters, but also offers a host of benefits to the local economy and community. This is a timely investment and one we’re grateful for.” Monthly rents are projected to range between approximately $600 (studio) and $700 (one bedroom). The new homes are expected to be complete by late October 2020. “We are proud to have found an innovative way to add new eight new homes to this housing project in Sooke,” said Kevin Albers, CEO, M’akola Housing Society. “Affordable housing is a valued addition to every community, and we are excited that our partnerships with the Province and community of Sooke have made this possible.” The Province continues to work with partners to address the housing needs of people in Sooke, including those who are experiencing homelessness. In partnership with the District of Sooke, plans were recently announced for a new temporary shelter, located on a private piece of land, to provide vulnerable people with a safe place to stay while permanent housing is underway. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

114,https://news.bchousing.org/province-buys-american-hotel-for-more-affordable-housing/,29-06-2020,Province buys American Hotel for more affordable housing,"VANCOUVER − The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the 42-unit American Hotel in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside for people who have been living in supportive housing and are ready to take the next step toward independent living. “Housing is the foundation of peoples’ lives, and we’ve seen that our supportive housing model works in helping people transition to the next chapter in their story,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These homes will provide another safe, secure and supportive option for people as they move forward in their journey to independent living.” The building will be managed by experienced BC Housing staff, who will provide residents with supports like daily living skills training, such as budgeting, nutrition management, meal preparation, medication management, house cleaning and other skills. “Affordable housing with wraparound services is key to supporting people in the Downtown Eastside and neighbouring communities,” said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver-Mount Pleasant. “These new 42 BC Housing units represent an opportunity to empower community members as they transition into independent living and build new pathways for themselves.” Current tenants will be able to remain at the American and will have access to the supportive services, as needed. Over time, as existing tenants choose to leave and units become vacant, they will be occupied by new residents ready to leave supportive housing and live more independently. In addition to purchasing the hotel at 928 Main St., the Province has also bought the adjacent vacant site at 938 Main St., for a total investment of $17.9 million through the Supportive Housing Fund. Over the long term, BC Housing plans to redevelop the American Hotel, as well as the adjacent vacant site, to create additional rental housing in the community. BC Housing will engage with the community on how these sites can be used to build a mix of homes for people in Vancouver and will go through the municipal rezoning process. “Nothing is more critical for the City of Vancouver and our residents than tackling the housing affordability crisis, that's why seeing the Province of B.C. purchase The American Hotel to provide more affordable housing is welcome news,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to provide all residents with safe, affordable housing, especially for our most vulnerable neighbours, and the only way to do this is through strong partnerships between the City of Vancouver and the Government of B.C.” Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

Over time, as existing tenants choose to leave and units become vacant, they will be occupied by new residents ready to leave supportive housing and live more independently. In addition to purchasing the hotel at 928 Main St., the Province has also bought the adjacent vacant site at 938 Main St., for a total investment of $17.9 million through the Supportive Housing Fund. Over the long term, BC Housing plans to redevelop the American Hotel, as well as the adjacent vacant site, to create additional rental housing in the community. BC Housing will engage with the community on how these sites can be used to build a mix of homes for people in Vancouver and will go through the municipal rezoning process. “Nothing is more critical for the City of Vancouver and our residents than tackling the housing affordability crisis, that's why seeing the Province of B.C. purchase The American Hotel to provide more affordable housing is welcome news,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to provide all residents with safe, affordable housing, especially for our most vulnerable neighbours, and the only way to do this is through strong partnerships between the City of Vancouver and the Government of B.C.” Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The building, named Linda’s Place, is a partnership between the Government of Canada, the Province and the Campbell River Head Injury Support Society. “These new homes will provide new opportunities, security and peace of mind for brain injury survivors and their families,” said Claire Trevena, MLA for North Island. “Our government will continue to work with partners to invest in homes, like the 27 affordable homes at Linda’s Place, to help create healthy and thriving communities.” Located at 531 9th Ave., the four-storey building includes a mix of studio, and one-, two- and three-bedroom apartments. Nine of the units are allocated to people with brain injuries and their families, with rents at or near the shelter rate allowance for people with disabilities. The remaining 18 units will be rented at below-market rents, ranging from $750 per month (one bedroom) to $1,250 (three bedroom). “Our government’s investment in affordable housing in Campbell River is helping improve the lives of people living with brain injuries and their families,” said Adam Vaughan, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Families, Children and Social Development, on behalf of Ahmed Hussen, federal Minister of Families, Children and Social Development and the Minister responsible for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). “With a safe and affordable place to call home, along with support from the dedicated people at the Campbell River Head Injury Support Society, these families can now focus more energy on rehabilitation and other positive pursuits. This is a community achievement we can all be proud to be a part of.” People started moving into their homes in early June 2020. “On behalf of the City of Campbell River council and community, we thank the continued efforts of the Campbell River Head Injury Society and greatly appreciate the provincial and federal funding support for this important and much-needed community housing resource,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “The city has been proud to support this project through waiving development and other cost charges, and to advocate on behalf of the people leading the charge on the development of Linda’s Place over the years. Congratulations and thank you to all for the difference you are making in people’s lives by ensuring they have a safe and supportive place to call home.” The Campbell River Head Injury Support Society, which provides education, support, advocacy and fellowship to brain injury survivors, caregivers and the public about brain injury, will operate the housing. The society created a brain injury specific housing program in 2011 and will provide support services and daily contact with a support worker for brain-injured tenants. “We are very excited for Linda’s Place, where we now have 27 affordable homes to offer to our members and the community,” said Shelley Howard, executive director, Campbell River Head Injury Support Society. “Being able to spend less on rent means more money in their pocket, which means a better quality of life.

There’s a real need for housing for people with different incomes, from young families to seniors, and we’ll be engaging with the community on how we can use this site to deliver urgently needed homes.” In the interim, the Howard Johnson site will operate as temporary supportive housing while long-term plans are developed. BC Housing will connect with partners and the community to begin the conversation about how the site and the adjacent parking lot can be used to tackle the housing crisis and build a mix of homes for people in Vancouver. “The purchase of these hotels holds great short- and long-term potential for providing much-needed safe and secure housing that goes beyond four walls and a bed,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “We are working to develop a model of supportive housing that meets people’s needs with appropriate health, mental health and addictions supports, and creates opportunities to live a safer, healthier life as part of a community.” The Province has also purchased the 63-room Buchan Hotel at 1906 Haro St. to provide housing with supports for women. The site is empty, and residents will begin moving into the Buchan in July. Atira Women’s Resource Society will operate the housing at both hotels, which include wraparound supports where people have access to services such as meals, health care, addictions treatment and harm reduction, as well as storage for personal belongings. The sites also have 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood. ”Atira is thrilled to be a partner in this essential housing,” said Janice Abbott, CEO, Atira Group. “Especially at this time, it’s even more important that we all come together to ensure people’s fundamental right to housing is honoured, while at the same time, ensuring that the health and well-being of everyone, including people traditionally marginalized by mainstream society, is paramount.” BC Housing is setting up a new community dialogue group that will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood. “The COVID-19 pandemic has put into even-sharper focus our urgent need for housing, especially for our most vulnerable neighbours,” said Kennedy Stewart, mayor, City of Vancouver. “These hotel rooms will provide immediate safety and shelter while we work with the Province and the community to develop the long-term vision. Now, more than ever, we must come together to make sure all our neighbours are safe and supported, and I cannot thank the Government of B.C. enough for its leadership.” These purchases are part of the Province’s ongoing actions to provide housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness and build on the more than 780 supportive homes that have been opened in Vancouver in the last two years. In Vancouver, BC Housing and its partners are also operating various temporary housing options in hotels and shelter facilities to serve vulnerable people in Vancouver during the COVID-19 pandemic. The Province will continue to support people after the COVID-19 pandemic and these homes deliver on that commitment.

Construction of the two new buildings is expected to begin in early 2021. ""Permanent housing for all citizens is essential for healthy individuals, healthy communities and healthy societies,” said Sonia Furstenau, MLA for Cowichan Valley. “This investment in Cowichan comes as a result of the government responding to the united calls from local housing advocates, health-care providers and leaders in our community. “We have seen successful outcomes for homeless people from the temporary housing plan with wraparound services the Cowichan Housing Association and other organizations put in place in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. It works because all the pieces are working together: housing, security, food, mental health support. Permanent housing for people in Cowichan will build on these first steps toward dignity and independence for all citizens.” The Drinkwater Road project will include approximately 50 units and will be operated by Lookout Housing & Health Society. Construction is expected to be complete in early 2021. The White Road location will include up to 50 homes. A housing operator for this building will be selected in the coming months, and construction is expected to be complete in early 2021. “I am pleased to see these projects move forward in our respective communities. I have been a long-time proponent of permanent housing solutions with much-needed wraparound services,” said Al Siebring, mayor, North Cowichan. “These units will help address homelessness both in North Cowichan and in the Cowichan Valley while giving our most vulnerable populations access to vital services.” The housing will be comprised of self-contained studio homes. Residents will be provided with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. “Duncan city council has identified working to address the homelessness and opioid crisis as top priorities for this term,” said Michelle Staples, mayor, City of Duncan. “Service providers and health-care professionals have been asking for supportive housing with wraparound services, including treatment options and safe supply, for many years. These projects are yet another example of what becomes possible when we define a goal, commit to action and work together as local and provincial governments to meet the needs in our communities.” BC Housing will set up community advisory committees in both municipalities to oversee integration of the supportive housing within the community and address any concerns raised by people in both communities as the projects move forward. The committees will be established prior to the housing opening. “I'm pleased to be working with our neighboring communities to address the homelessness or those at risk of becoming homeless,” said Chief William Seymour, Cowichan Tribes. “This gives them an opportunity to have a safe and secure home, especially during this pandemic era. This is a much-needed resource in the Cowichan community.” Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The building will include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room. Construction for Guildford Place is expected to be complete by May 2021, with residents moving in soon after. “The need for safe, secure housing has never been more important,” said Gary Begg, MLA for Surrey-Guildford. “We are taking urgent action with our partners to provide more supportive homes because we’ve seen how successful this type of housing has been for helping people move forward with their lives.” In addition, BC Housing and the City of Surrey have identified a site for another supportive housing building. Located at 13620 80 Ave., the building will consist of 40 homes for people experiencing homelessness in the community. “Our community is safer and healthier when people have housing and the supports they need,” said Harry Bains, MLA for Surrey-Newton. “These new homes are another step forward in reducing homelessness in Surrey and making sure people have a place to call their own.” BC Housing intends to submit a temporary use permit application for the 80th Avenue site to the City of Surrey later in June. If approved, construction will begin by September 2020. Details about the project will be mailed directly to local residents and businesses and posted online:https://letstalkhousingbc.ca/surrey Both projects are part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community.

123,https://news.bchousing.org/more-affordable-interim-housing-coming-for-people-in-victoria/,02-06-2020,More interim housing coming for people in Victoria,"VICTORIA – The Province has purchased Paul’s Motor Inn, located at 1900 Douglas St., to provide more temporary accommodations for people experiencing homelessness in Victoria. “The purchase of this site will help support vulnerable people in the community and provide a safe place for those who don’t have a home,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Not only will this building deliver immediate relief and support to vulnerable people affected by the COVID-19 crisis, the site also offers permanent housing potential to help tackle the housing crisis and meet the needs of people in Victoria.” Over the long term, BC Housing plans to redevelop the site into a range of affordable housing, the details of which will be determined through engagement with the community. In the meantime, the building will provide approximately 75 temporary homes with wraparound supports for vulnerable people experiencing homelessness in Greater Victoria. In April 2020, the City of Victoria leased 35 rooms at the hotel, which are being used as temporary housing for vulnerable people to maintain physical distance during the COVID-19 pandemic. By purchasing the entire hotel, the Province can maintain these rooms and provide an additional 40 rooms for people as work continues with the City of Victoria and partners on long-term permanent housing solutions. “Purchasing this property allows us the opportunity to provide our most vulnerable people with sustainable places to stay and feel safe,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “This location holds a great deal of potential to create a community, complete with health, mental health, addictions and social supports for people who need them most.” In the coming weeks, once an experienced operator has been selected, BC Housing will begin transitioning people into the building. Residents will be selected through BC Housing’s co-ordinated access and assessment process. People will have access to services such as meals, health care, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports. The site will feature 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood. “The Province continues to be a strong partner as we work together to provide safety and security to our vulnerable populations in Victoria,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This second motel purchase demonstrates the Province’s commitment to making long-term investments and to ensure that no one who has been housed during the pandemic ends up back on the street.” As it does with most of its supportive housing projects, BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood. The latest acquisition is part of the Province’s work to transition people from homelessness to stable housing and its commitment to continue supporting people after the COVID-19 pandemic. In Victoria, BC Housing and its partners are also operating the temporary Emergency Response Centre at the Save-On-Foods Memorial Centre and the temporary housing at the newly purchased Comfort Inn, as well as various temporary housing options in hotels and shelter facilities, to serve vulnerable people during the COVID-19 pandemic. From April 25 to May 20, 2020, 344 people were moved from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park into safe, temporary accommodations with supports. These moves were part of an order under the Emergency Protection Act to ensure their health and safety during the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.

With the purchase of the Heritage River Inn, BC Housing is now able to provide 41 units of stable, long-term, affordable rental housing for low-income individuals displaced by the fire. Over the past month, some households have been able to secure new housing, but the remaining households will soon begin moving into the former inn. The building has a mix of one- and two-bedroom apartments. All units are expected to be occupied in the coming weeks. Since April, BC Housing has provided temporary housing at a local hotel and daily meals to people displaced by the fire. The John Howard Society, Sasamans Society and the City of Campbell River also have provided daily support and assistance to help people find alternate housing. “From the beginning, provincial resources and community social service agencies have been key in helping people feel safe and secure following the fire and the loss of their homes,” said Andy Adams, mayor, City of Campbell River. “With BC Housing purchasing this property and making affordable rental housing available to these people, some of the urgent need for shelter in Campbell River’s extremely limited rental market will be relieved. On behalf of council and our community, we are very appreciative of the support and quick action and look forward to continuing to work closely with BC Housing on other long-term solutions to meet the demand for local supportive and affordable housing.” In the coming weeks, a service provider will be selected to operate the new site and oversee day-to-day management of the building.

Peterson Place is part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community. Peterson Place is the first project under construction as part of this commitment. ""With construction beginning today on Peterson Place, we are on our way to providing permanent, safe and meaningful housing to our most vulnerable residents,” said Doug McCallum, Mayor of Surrey. “This project illustrates the dedication of various levels of government and organizations working together to end the cycle of homelessness. I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this project from idea to reality.” Fraserside Community Services Society (FCSS) will operate the new housing with supports.

The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room. Peterson Place is part of a commitment between the Province and the City of Surrey to deliver 250 permanent supportive modular homes to replace the current temporary sites in the community. Peterson Place is the first project under construction as part of this commitment. ""With construction beginning today on Peterson Place, we are on our way to providing permanent, safe and meaningful housing to our most vulnerable residents,” said Doug McCallum, Mayor of Surrey. “This project illustrates the dedication of various levels of government and organizations working together to end the cycle of homelessness. I want to thank everyone involved for bringing this project from idea to reality.” Fraserside Community Services Society (FCSS) will operate the new housing with supports. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. ""We are thrilled that even during these uncertain pandemic times, this project is moving ahead,” said Lynda Edmonds, CEO of FCSS. “We are thankful that the Province and the City of Surrey recognize the importance of safe and secure housing for people experiencing homelessness. The addition of 38 new units and the expansion of on-site services, including access to daily meals and counselling, will have a significant and positive impact on the lives of residents at Peterson Place and in creating broader communities of belonging for all people in Surrey."" Construction is expected to be complete by the end of summer 2020, with residents moving in during the fall. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The building will also include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical room. To help people move from the streets and shelters into this safe and secure housing, the city and the Province are working together to expedite the building process and removing the requirement of a municipal rezoning. The current lease is for 10 years, and the property will go through the municipal rezoning process if the lease is extended beyond that. “Homelessness is an evolving, dynamic crisis in our community, and these kinds of partnerships go a long way towards creating solutions,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “This is a strategic land investment that will not only create much needed solutions in the short term, but also has long-term potential with a future land use designation for multi-storey residential housing. In addition to being close to downtown, this property is ideally located adjacent to existing municipal park space and could fulfil many different civic objectives after expiry of the lease.” BC Housing supports the city in its commitment to the Journey Home Strategy, focusing on ending chronic and episodic homelessness, introducing measures to prevent homelessness in the first place and implementing a co-ordinated systems approach to homelessness. “To provide people with the support and services they need to begin their recovery journey, they first need a place to call home,” said Stephanie Ball, executive director, Central Okanagan Journey Home Society. “This is a welcome addition to the over 100 units of housing with supports already planned to come on stream over the next two years as we work to meet the goals of Kelowna’s five-year plan to address homelessness.” The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) Kelowna will operate the new housing. It will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. “Access to safe and stable housing is a crucial first step needed for anyone who experiences homelessness so they can begin to get their feet back under them,” says Shelagh Turner, executive director, CMHA Kelowna. “We are proud to be the operators of this building and our other supportive housing in Kelowna so we can be there to help end the cycle of homelessness.” Site preparation work will start in June, with construction expected to be complete in fall 2020.

These homes with supports will help people experiencing homelessness to regroup and recover, and the benefits will extend into the community.” The Province, through BC Housing, has purchased the former Raffles Inn motel at 1080 3rd Ave. and will convert it into a permanent supportive housing building with up to 48 units, each with private washrooms, showers and mini kitchens. The building will include a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge areas, storage and amenity space, laundry and a medical examination room. Once complete, this building will have the capacity for a 35-space temporary shelter or an extreme weather response shelter. “These new units of supportive housing will offer 24/7 support to our community's most vulnerable, including achieving economies of scale by integrating a temporary shelter as well,” said Lee Brain, mayor, Prince Rupert. “When the first supportive units opened at Crow’s Nest, they were immediately full, proving that the need exceeded the supply of available units. We are happy to be working with the Province to make this happen in Prince Rupert.” NCTS will operate the supportive housing building and will provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services and opportunities for volunteer work. “We are very excited about this opportunity and much needed project that serve the needs of the most marginalized members of our community,” said Christine White, executive director, NCTS. “The people of Prince Rupert have been so generous and supportive of those living on the streets. We know that this will benefit the community as having a home and a safe place is a start for life-changing opportunities. BC Housing and MLA Jennifer Rice have been a huge support in this project, in addition to all our other community partners. We look forward to moving on with the project.” NCTS operates a 35-space temporary shelter at Fisherman’s Hall at 869 Fraser St. Once renovations at 1080 3rd Ave. are complete, all guests from the shelter will be transitioned to the new supportive housing. Construction will begin in fall 2020. The shelter portion of the building is expected to open in early 2021, with the supportive homes ready by fall 2021.

The Independent Living Housing Society believes that good living starts with home and this housing development provides an opportunity for us to support more people with disabilities to make a home in this community.” Colin Tessier, executive director, Threshold Housing Society –“We are excited to partner with the Capital Region Housing Corporation on the Westview housing project. There is a desperate need for safe and affordable housing options for at-risk youth in our community, and this project is helping to address that critical need. Youth housed at Westview will receive robust support services and access to positive community through the Threshold support program. Access to safe housing and appropriate supports for at-risk youth is a key strategy to preventing future instances of adult homelessness.” Facts: Learn A map showing the location of all announced provincially funded housing projects in B.C. is available To learn about the steps the Province is taking to tackle the housing crisis and deliver affordable homes for British Columbians, For more information about the Capital Region Housing Corporation, visit:https://www.crd.bc.ca/crhc Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing Media Andy OrrCapital Regional District250 360-3229 Laura MathewsBC"

In the short term, the building will provide approximately 65 rooms of temporary accommodations with wraparound supports for people currently living in encampments on the Pandora Avenue corridor and Topaz Park. “Often people experiencing homelessness are not able to access the support and services they need,” said Shane Simpson, Minister of Social Development and Poverty Reduction. “The purchase of the Comfort Inn, combined with medical and social supports, will help people make the transition from the street to permanent housing.” BC Housing is partnering with Our Place to operate the building, which will start to receive people − referred by Island Health and BC Housing − in the coming days. “This is a substantial investment in our community and will provide housing for those who need it most,” says Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “This site has significant redevelopment potential to provide a range of affordable housing in the long term. I look forward to working with the community and with BC Housing to determine the long-term use of this site.” People will have access to services, such as meals, health-care services, addictions treatment and harm reduction, storage for personal belongings and other supports, including 24/7 staffing to provide security to residents of the building and the surrounding neighbourhood. “Our Place is looking forward to partnering with BC Housing in this bold initiative to provide indoor accommodations for our street family during this health crisis,” said Grant McKenzie, director of communications, Our Place Society. “We intend to serve this vulnerable population with dignity while striving to be a good neighbour to the community.” BC Housing will set up a new community advisory committee that will include representatives from the Hillside Quadra and Burnside Gorge community associations and the surrounding community. This committee will oversee the supportive housing’s integration within the community and will address any concerns raised by people in the neighbourhood. From April 25 to May 13, 2020, 208 people from encampments on Pandora Avenue and in Topaz Park have moved into safe, temporary accommodations with supports to protect their health and safety in the overlapping COVID-19 and overdose crises.

Funding is being provided through the HousingHub, a BC Housing branch that works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to increase affordable rental housing and home ownership options for middle-income British Columbians. It acts as a centre for housing expertise and collaboration and helps create housing either through new construction or through redeveloping existing sites. The complex consists of two one-bedroom units and four two-bedroom units. Renovations to these units will increase the building’s lifespan and ensure six homes for low- and middle-income Indigenous individuals and families remain accessible. “We are excited to be able to keep these homes on the market,” said Christos Vardacostas, executive director, Aboriginal Housing Society of Prince George. “Having a home is fundamental, and this is a great opportunity for us to work with the Province to make sure these spaces stay affordable and available.” The society has assumed ownership and operations of the residence. The current tenants of the building will not be affected by the acquisition. Monthly rents will be carried over at the same rates.

""We are helping build safe, secure homes, so families don’t have to choose between leaving their community or having an affordable place to live.” Located at 2841 Livingstone Ave., Gardner Living 1 will provide two- and three-bedroom rental homes for households with annual incomes ranging between approximately $80,000 and $96,000. Monthly rents will range between $2,020 and $2,390. The townhomes will add family housing to a community facing low vacancy rates. The Province is providing $27.9 million in low-cost construction financing, which will reduce the cost of the project. Those savings will be passed on to the people who live there through lower monthly rental rates. The funding is through a BC Housing program called the HousingHub, created by the Province in 2018. The HousingHub works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to help create new affordable rental housing and homeownership options for middle-income British Columbians. “Gardner Living in Abbotsford is one of three affordable rental projects Mosaic currently has in development and construction, adding to our portfolio of rental homes under Mosaic ownership and management,” said Geoff Duyker, senior vice-president, Mosaic Homes. “Mosaic is proud to be working with BC Housing, landowners and local municipalities to build more rental housing for the region. We are actively seeking out additional opportunities to address the need for more rental homes for British Columbians.” Construction started in November 2019. The project is expected to be completed by January 2022. “We’re pleased that the Province continues to address rental housing within the City of Abbotsford, given that access to housing is critical for all demographics,” said Henry Braun, mayor, City of Abbotsford. “Abbotsford has one of the lowest vacancy rates in the country, and this project is one piece in addressing housing needs for middle-income earners.” Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

""We are building new partnerships to create new homes like these so that people can afford to stay in their community.” Located at 7251 Cedar Valley Connector, Cedar Valley Suites provides 68 rental homes, including 53 market rental homes that will be affordable for households with annual incomes ranging between approximately $52,000 and $66,000. Fifteen homes will be for people with low incomes, including seniors on fixed incomes. Monthly rents will range between $375 and $1,323. The building will add much-needed rental supply to a community facing low vacancy rates. Cedar Valley Suites was purchased by the Lookout Housing and Health Society in September 2019 with support from a BC Housing program called the HousingHub, which was created by the Province in 2018. The HousingHub works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to help create new affordable rental housing and home-ownership options for middle-income British Columbians. “Lookout is pleased to partner with BC Housing to provide 68 units of mixed-income rental housing in the District of Mission,” said Shayne Williams, CEO, Lookout Housing and Health Society. “The unit mix of one bedroom, one bedroom plus den and two-bedroom homes provides safe, affordable homes for fixed income seniors, single moms and low- to middle-income earners.

""We are building new partnerships to create new homes like these so that people can afford to stay in their community.” Located at 7251 Cedar Valley Connector, Cedar Valley Suites provides 68 rental homes, including 53 market rental homes that will be affordable for households with annual incomes ranging between approximately $52,000 and $66,000. Fifteen homes will be for people with low incomes, including seniors on fixed incomes. Monthly rents will range between $375 and $1,323. The building will add much-needed rental supply to a community facing low vacancy rates. Cedar Valley Suites was purchased by the Lookout Housing and Health Society in September 2019 with support from a BC Housing program called the HousingHub, which was created by the Province in 2018. The HousingHub works with community, government and non-profit and private-sector stakeholders to help create new affordable rental housing and home-ownership options for middle-income British Columbians. “Lookout is pleased to partner with BC Housing to provide 68 units of mixed-income rental housing in the District of Mission,” said Shayne Williams, CEO, Lookout Housing and Health Society. “The unit mix of one bedroom, one bedroom plus den and two-bedroom homes provides safe, affordable homes for fixed income seniors, single moms and low- to middle-income earners.

The Welcome Inn shelter is located at 1265 Ellis St. and was a site brought forward by the community. Renovations are underway. The shelter could open in late December or early January, depending on when sufficient staff are available to safely operate the building. This is a temporary shelter to provide a place for people to go during the winter until March 31, 2020. Due to the significant number of people in Kelowna who are experiencing homelessness and living outside, existing shelters are at or near capacity on a nightly basis. The Province’s non-profit partners in the region are also running at capacity, limiting their ability to take on additional initiatives. Faced with the need, and the lack of traditional options, BC Housing is partnering with Welcome Inn, a new community-based group that came together in order to operate the shelter. The group is led by experienced staff who are in the process of hiring volunteers to help with day-to-day operations. Turning Points Collaborative Society, a service provider based in Vernon, will also be supporting with mentoring and training for staff and volunteers. The shelter will provide approximately 20 beds when it opens. As additional volunteers are identified, the shelter could expand capacity for up to 40 beds. The goal is for the shelter to be open 24/7, but depending on staff availability, the shelter may initially open overnights only. The Metro Community Church warming centre is located behind the shelter and will be available for shelter guests during the daytime. Shelter guests will have access to daily meals, storage for their belongings, washrooms and a common room. At least two staff members will be on site at all times and the operator will provide information about the project and contact details for neighbours and community members who may have questions or concerns.

Government made the announcement to kick off the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender-Based Violence. “It’s encouraging to see communities and partners around the province working together to ensure that women and children have safe and secure places to go when they need help,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Everyone deserves to live a life free of violence with hope for the future, and we are working hard to create more homes and opportunities for women and children to thrive.” The Province is working with housing providers in urban, rural and First Nations communities to build these homes. Combined with the first round of projects announced in 2018, more than 600 new homes are open or in progress. “Having worked for much of my career in the social sector, I can tell you that these investments are long overdue,” said Mitzi Dean, Parliamentary Secretary for Gender Equity. “I know we have a lot of work to do, and I’m grateful for the many community partners involved in bringing these essential housing projects to reality. The next 16 days are an emphasis on the work that has already begun. From the historic waves of feminism, to today’s #MeToo movement, together, we can end gender-based violence.” The homes will be operated by non-profit providers that specialize in housing and supports for women and children who are experiencing or at risk of violence. In addition to funding the construction of these homes, the Province will provide funding for support services including emotional support, safety planning and information and referrals to medical, legal and financial assistance. “Cowichan Women Against Violence Society is pleased to be working with BC Housing on a second-stage housing project for women,” said Debbie Berg, executive director, Cowichan Women Against Violence Society. “We are often over capacity at our transition house and night shelter, so this provides much-needed affordable accommodation for women in the Cowichan Valley. This project will not only provide a place to live but will also have wraparound services delivered from trauma-informed practice to assist women in rebuilding their lives. We look forward to our continued connection with BC Housing on this project.” The projects are part of the Province’s 10-year, $734-million investment to build 1,500 safe homes with supports for women and children leaving violence. This is the first major investment in the sector in close to 20 years and will increase the number of transition homes by 63%. These new transition housing projects are part of a government-wide effort to support survivors of gender-based violence, which includes new training programs for survivors of violence and abuse, and enhanced counselling services in communities throughout the province. Government is also addressing gender-based violence by improving the economic security of women with expanded access to affordable child care, a higher minimum wage and improved housing affordability. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The society is receiving $10.6 million from the Province’s Building BC: Community Housing Fund, as well as construction financing, for the project. The District of North Vancouver will waive development costs of approximately $2.8 million. The society provided the land valued at $13.6 million and equity of $12.1 million for the new building. The project will be located next to Lynn Manor, a 205-unit high-rise for seniors, which has been operated by the society since 1974. The two properties were designed to create a sense of community with shared offices, indoor and outdoor amenity spaces. “We are delighted to announce the construction of our newest rental building for seniors on the North Shore,” said Patrick McLaughlin, board chair, Kiwanis North Shore Housing Society. “This project would not be possible without the support and participation of the Province and District of North Vancouver, and for that we are very appreciative.

This project also brings our community a new home for our Fire Hall #1 that will meet the highest standard for a post-disaster public safety building.” Pacifica Housing is receiving $19 million from the Province’s Building BC: Community Housing Fund, as well as annual operating funding, for the project. People in need of affordable rental housing will have access to studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes ranging in size from 365 to 1,011 square feet. “Victoria has an acute shortage of affordable rental housing,” said Margaret Eckenfelder, executive director, Pacifica Housing. “The 130 new homes will improve the lives of families, children and individuals in our community and ensure that Victoria remains vibrant and diverse. Pacifica is excited to be part of this unique partnership and hopes that it can provide a model for future much-needed affordable developments.” Dalmatian Developments is building the structure as Phase 1 of a mixed-use community. More than 370 market-rate homes will be built in the remaining phases of the development that will also include a diverse mix of commercial, retail and restaurants, as well as dedicated public spaces, including a 2,700-square-foot public plaza. “We’re very proud to be a partner in building these affordable rental homes as the first phase of a vibrant and inclusive community in downtown Victoria,” said Elizabeth Jawl, director, Dalmatian Developments and Jawl Residential. “Working collaboratively with BC Housing, Pacifica Housing and the City of Victoria, we have achieved affordability through innovation, investment and dedication, and we hope this is the first of many projects we work on together.“ These 130 homes are part of the more than 22,000 new homes that are complete or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments.

As of Aug. 31, 2019, this includes: Housing for middle-income earners (households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $150,000) – approximately 4,120 homes: Housing for people with low to moderate incomes (including some where rents are based on 30% of household income and others with set rents, which are designed to be affordable; to moderate-income households, in most cases earning less than $70,000 annually) – approximately 9,320 homes: Housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness (shelter-rate housing) – approximately 3,060 homes: Housing for women and children leaving violence – approximately 360 homes: Housing for students – approximately 5,600 homes: Total: approximately 22,460 homes  Housing778 584-2433 BC Housingmedia@bchousing.org","VICTORIA – People with low and middle incomes in Victoria will benefit from 130 new affordable rental homes in the downtown area. “Affordable housing projects like this are long overdue in Victoria and throughout British Columbia,” said Carole James, MLA for Victoria-Beacon Hill. “Alongside our community partners, we’re taking action to ensure more people in Victoria have a safe and affordable place to call home.” The Province is partnering with Pacifica Housing and Dalmatian Developments to build the new homes at 1025 Johnson St. The 130 homes will be the largest purpose-built affordable rental project of its kind in downtown Victoria and will be located in a mixed-use building above a new fire hall. “This is the first new affordable housing to be built for people in our downtown in more than 20 years,” said Lisa Helps, mayor, City of Victoria. “It’s exactly the kind of response to the housing crisis we need from community-minded companies like these, working in partnership with the provincial government and our local housing providers. This project also brings our community a new home for our Fire Hall #1 that will meet the highest standard for a post-disaster public safety building.” Pacifica Housing is receiving $19 million from the Province’s Building BC: Community Housing Fund, as well as annual operating funding, for the project. People in need of affordable rental housing will have access to studio, one-bedroom, two-bedroom and three-bedroom homes ranging in size from 365 to 1,011 square feet. “Victoria has an acute shortage of affordable rental housing,” said Margaret Eckenfelder, executive director, Pacifica Housing. “The 130 new homes will improve the lives of families, children and individuals in our community and ensure that Victoria remains vibrant and diverse. Pacifica is excited to be part of this unique partnership and hopes that it can provide a model for future much-needed affordable developments.” Dalmatian Developments is building the structure as Phase 1 of a mixed-use community. More than 370 market-rate homes will be built in the remaining phases of the development that will also include a diverse mix of commercial, retail and restaurants, as well as dedicated public spaces, including a 2,700-square-foot public plaza. “We’re very proud to be a partner in building these affordable rental homes as the first phase of a vibrant and inclusive community in downtown Victoria,” said Elizabeth Jawl, director, Dalmatian Developments and Jawl Residential. “Working collaboratively with BC Housing, Pacifica Housing and the City of Victoria, we have achieved affordability through innovation, investment and dedication, and we hope this is the first of many projects we work on together.“ These 130 homes are part of the more than 22,000 new homes that are complete or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments.

We’re proud to be working with our partners to deliver thousands of new homes like these across B.C.” The proposed development would be located at 660/670 Old Hope Princeton Way, connected to House of Hope, a 20-bed shelter that the society has operated since fall 2018. BC Housing and the society will submit a rezoning application for both spaces on Nov. 26. BC Housing would lead the construction of the project. The society would operate the building and provide residents with meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services. Hope has no supportive housing. Service providers estimate there are more than 40 people experiencing homelessness in the area, in addition to people currently accessing the House of Hope shelter. “Hope and Area Transition Society has been the primary lead on homelessness initiatives in Hope since 2008,” said Gerry Dyble, executive director, Hope and Area Transition Society. “For the past decade, Hope has seen a growing number of vulnerable and at-risk people in need of housing and support services. “Many people have been displaced as a result of the rising cost of rentals. The fact is that Hope does not have affordable housing options or a continuum of housing options for those facing complex challenges. Having supportive housing in Hope will mean that the most vulnerable will no longer be living in unsafe, unsupportive conditions, they will be able to find dignity, gain purpose and stabilize their mental health and substance-use issues.” If the project is approved, BC Housing will update the community with the estimated project cost and proposed construction timeline. If approved, funding for the project would come from the Province’s Supportive Housing Fund.

Located at 831 Carnarvon St., the new development is under construction as part of a partnership between the Province, PAL Vancouver and Vintop Development Corporation. “This unique project will give people in our community the peace of mind that comes with safe and secure housing — something that every British Columbian deserves,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster. “It is a great example of how working with community partners, we can build affordable homes for people from all walks of life across B.C.” The Province is providing $7.4 million to help build the eight-storey building, which will provide 25 studios and 41 one-bedroom units for those from arts-oriented professions with low to moderate incomes. Priority will be given to seniors and people with disabilities. PAL Vancouver will be the operator.

Located at 831 Carnarvon St., the new development is under construction as part of a partnership between the Province, PAL Vancouver and Vintop Development Corporation. “This unique project will give people in our community the peace of mind that comes with safe and secure housing — something that every British Columbian deserves,” said Judy Darcy, MLA for New Westminster. “It is a great example of how working with community partners, we can build affordable homes for people from all walks of life across B.C.” The Province is providing $7.4 million to help build the eight-storey building, which will provide 25 studios and 41 one-bedroom units for those from arts-oriented professions with low to moderate incomes. Priority will be given to seniors and people with disabilities. PAL Vancouver will be the operator. The non-profit organization was established in 2001 to provide long-standing members of performing arts professions with affordable housing in a vibrant community. Vintop Development Corporation is contributing $2 million to the project.

Through this new facility and the vital support, services and care that will be provided, residents will have their individual needs met, get on track for permanent housing and find a healthy, stable path in life.” The building includes an on-site intensive case management team, which will provide access to treatment and mental health services. The team is funded by Fraser Health and led by the Langley Community Services Society, in partnership with the Salvation Army, Encompass Support Services Society and Stepping Stone Community Services Society. “A project like this with strong partnerships is very valuable in providing solutions to complex community issues,” said Dan Kipper, director, mental health and substance use, Fraser Health. “Fraser Health is pleased to be a part of such a collaboration.” The housing has at least two experienced staff on-site 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

These homes will provide dignity and hope for the people who will call this place home and will support the well-being of the whole community.” Located at 3986 Norland Ave., the three-storey modular apartment building features 52 units, each with a private washroom and mini kitchen. Six of the units are wheelchair accessible. The building includes a commercial kitchen, a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together and a common laundry room. “Norland is a step toward achieving the supply of safe and affordable housing people need,” said Mike Hurley, mayor, City of Burnaby. “For individuals, it is a chance to build a healthier and more stable life. For the community, it is a signal that the City of Burnaby is committed to public safety and ensuring there is a place here for everyone.” Progressive Housing Society will operate the building and provide residents with health and wellness support services and meal programs, as well as life and employment skills training. By providing housing along with these wraparound services, supportive housing helps improve residents’ quality of life and reduces their use of health and social services in the long term. “Progressive Housing Society is so thrilled to be opening and operating 52 units of safe and secure supportive housing for some of Burnaby's most vulnerable citizens,” said Jaye Treit, executive director, Progressive Housing Society. “In partnership with the City of Burnaby and BC Housing, we know that this opportunity will not only make a positive change for the people we serve, it will also save lives. This is a crucial and important event for this community.” B.C.-based manufacturer Horizon North was selected by the Province to manufacture the modular units in Burnaby and several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and local economies. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

Budget 2018 included a $7-billion investment in the homes people need. As a result of that investment, more than 22,000 new homes are complete, under construction or in the approvals process for a range of people who are struggling to find a place to live — from people who are experiencing homelessness and seniors on fixed incomes, to middle-income families, students and individuals. As of Aug. 31, 2019, this includes: Housing for middle-income earners (households with annual incomes between $50,000 and $150,000) - approximately 4,120 homes: Housing for people with low to moderate incomes (including some where rents are based on 30% of household income and others with set rents, which are designed to be affordable to moderate-income households, in most cases earning less than $70,000 annually) - approximately 9,320 homes: Housing for people experiencing or at risk of homelessness (shelter-rate housing) - more than 3,060 homes: Housing for women and children leaving violence - approximately 360 homes: Housing for students - approximately 5,600 homes: Total: approximately 22,460 homes Contacts: Darren HarbordMinistry of Municipal Affairs and Housing250 882-8518 media@bchousing.orgBC Housing","BURNABY – More than 50 people who have been without safe and secure homes are moving into supportive housing with around-the-clock support services as a new permanent modular housing project opens. “This new supportive housing will give people the foundation they need to move forward with their lives,” said Janet Routledge, MLA for Burnaby North. “Everyone deserves that opportunity, and that is why we are working with municipalities, such as Burnaby, to deliver thousands of new supportive homes with 24/7 support for residents. These homes will provide dignity and hope for the people who will call this place home and will support the well-being of the whole community.” Located at 3986 Norland Ave., the three-storey modular apartment building features 52 units, each with a private washroom and mini kitchen. Six of the units are wheelchair accessible. The building includes a commercial kitchen, a dining lounge area where residents can enjoy meals together and a common laundry room. “Norland is a step toward achieving the supply of safe and affordable housing people need,” said Mike Hurley, mayor, City of Burnaby. “For individuals, it is a chance to build a healthier and more stable life. For the community, it is a signal that the City of Burnaby is committed to public safety and ensuring there is a place here for everyone.” Progressive Housing Society will operate the building and provide residents with health and wellness support services and meal programs, as well as life and employment skills training. By providing housing along with these wraparound services, supportive housing helps improve residents’ quality of life and reduces their use of health and social services in the long term. “Progressive Housing Society is so thrilled to be opening and operating 52 units of safe and secure supportive housing for some of Burnaby's most vulnerable citizens,” said Jaye Treit, executive director, Progressive Housing Society. “In partnership with the City of Burnaby and BC Housing, we know that this opportunity will not only make a positive change for the people we serve, it will also save lives. This is a crucial and important event for this community.” B.C.-based manufacturer Horizon North was selected by the Province to manufacture the modular units in Burnaby and several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and local economies. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus, and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

Projected monthly rents will range between $375 for some studios and one-bedroom units, and up to $1,050 for some two-bedroom units. A community centre on the ground floor of the building will be funded and operated by the District of Mission parks, recreation and culture department. Construction is expected to be complete in spring 2021. This project is part of more than 22,000 new homes that are completed or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments. This includes more than 5,200 homes in mixed-income buildings being developed through the Community Housing Fund.

The new homes will provide affordable housing for people across a range of income levels. Monthly rental rates will range between $375 for one-bedroom units and $1,150 for three-bedroom units. Horizon North built the three-storey apartment building and two-storey townhouses using modular construction technology, which allowed the project to be built quicker than if it was built using traditional concrete or stick-built construction. Boundary Family Services will operate the project. In partnership with BC Housing, the society will start selecting tenants in the coming weeks. This project is part of more than 22,000 new homes completed or underway throughout B.C. because of provincial investments, including more than 5,000 homes in mixed-income buildings through the Community Housing Fund.

Each of the units includes a private washroom and mini kitchen. The building also includes communal space for counselling and community meetings, a multi-purpose room, commercial kitchen and dining room. Outdoor amenities include a gazebo, bike and cart storage, and a pet-friendly running area. ASK Wellness Society, an experienced non-profit housing operator, will operate Burdock House and provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services. These include meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work. “On behalf of ASK Wellness Society, we are honoured to have worked with the City of Penticton and BC Housing to bring this vital housing facility to the community,” said Bob Hughes, executive director, ASK Wellness Society. “Sixty-two people who have lived without housing will now have a safe, supportive and affordable home to begin the journey to reclaim their health and connection to community. Penticton has waited years for this type of housing and we are proud to work with our community partners to make this project a tremendous success through support, clinical services and old-fashioned care and compassion.” “Penticton City Council is delighted to see this long discussed and highly anticipated housing project completed,” said John Vassilaki, mayor, City of Penticton. “Access to supportive housing for those in need supports council’s priority of building a safe, secure and healthy community. The opening of Burdock House, combined with the amenities, services and staff resources it provides its residents, will go a long way in providing a quality solution to Penticton’s housing challenge.” Penticton’s own Metric Modular was selected by the Province to manufacture the modular units for Burdock House and several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and the local economy. The name Burdock House was chosen by ASK Wellness Society to represent the native plant that grows in the area. Residents started moving in at the end of September 2019. The priority for resident selection was given to people experiencing homelessness in the Penticton area. The building will be fully occupied later this month.

Each of the units includes a private washroom and mini kitchen. The building also includes communal space for counselling and community meetings, a multi-purpose room, commercial kitchen and dining room. Outdoor amenities include a gazebo, bike and cart storage, and a pet-friendly running area. ASK Wellness Society, an experienced non-profit housing operator, will operate Burdock House and provide residents with 24/7 on-site staff and support services. These include meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work. “On behalf of ASK Wellness Society, we are honoured to have worked with the City of Penticton and BC Housing to bring this vital housing facility to the community,” said Bob Hughes, executive director, ASK Wellness Society. “Sixty-two people who have lived without housing will now have a safe, supportive and affordable home to begin the journey to reclaim their health and connection to community. Penticton has waited years for this type of housing and we are proud to work with our community partners to make this project a tremendous success through support, clinical services and old-fashioned care and compassion.” “Penticton City Council is delighted to see this long discussed and highly anticipated housing project completed,” said John Vassilaki, mayor, City of Penticton. “Access to supportive housing for those in need supports council’s priority of building a safe, secure and healthy community. The opening of Burdock House, combined with the amenities, services and staff resources it provides its residents, will go a long way in providing a quality solution to Penticton’s housing challenge.” Penticton’s own Metric Modular was selected by the Province to manufacture the modular units for Burdock House and several other modular projects in B.C., supporting jobs and the local economy. The name Burdock House was chosen by ASK Wellness Society to represent the native plant that grows in the area. Residents started moving in at the end of September 2019. The priority for resident selection was given to people experiencing homelessness in the Penticton area. The building will be fully occupied later this month. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

These 94 new homes will make life easier for families and seniors in Maple Ridge.” Located at 22768 119 Ave., the new rental home project will provide 94 units in a six-storey mixed-use building, with studio, one-, two- and three-bedroom homes for individuals, families and seniors in the community. “These 94 new homes will give people in our community safe and secure housing options,” said Lisa Beare, MLA for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows. “People who call Maple Ridge home should be able find housing and stay in their community. And we know it can be hard for families with children to find homes with enough space, which is why it’s so important for us to build these affordable family-sized homes.” The project will include office space for Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows Community Services. The organization is leading the development and will operate the complex once it is complete. Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows Community Services offers a wide variety of programs and services that help more than 13,000 people each year through 30 different programs and services. “This project is a huge double win for our community,” said Mike Morden, mayor, Maple Ridge. “After close to 50 years of work in our community, our Community Services family will have a permanent home. Above its new offices, there will be 94 units of affordable and accessible housing for seniors, families and people struggling with the high cost of housing in our region. This is a great project and partnership.” The Province is providing $13 million in funding, as well as construction financing for the project. Once complete, the Province will also provide operational funding to further increase the affordability of 20 of the units. Ten of these homes will be offered at the provincial shelter rate ($375 per month) and 10 will be rent-geared-to-income. This means that people with household incomes under $51,500 will pay no more than 30% of their monthly income towards rent. The City of Maple Ridge has committed to support the project through a suite of fee reductions and deferrals consistent with the former Town Centre Incentive Program. “Community Services is honoured to be a member of the housing community bringing safe, appropriate and affordable housing options to many individuals and families who have been desperately seeking local housing,” said Vicki Kipps, executive director, Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows Community Services. “We are incredibly grateful for the financial support of the Province of British Columbia and the guidance from BC Housing as we design and construct this beautiful building that will combine a community of multi-use residential homes with social services space for over 30 different programs and services.” Site preparation for the development has started with project completion estimated for early 2021.

179,https://news.bchousing.org/new-homes-with-supports-open-in-maple-ridge/,10-09-2019,New homes with supports open in Maple Ridge,"MAPLE RIDGE - New homes with wraparound services are now open in Maple Ridge, providing an opportunity for stable housing for people who have lived at the Anita Place encampment and others experiencing homelessness in the area. ""The opening of this supportive housing provides a real solution to a situation that went on for too long in this community,"" said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Housing with wraparound support services included is already helping people from homeless camps in Surrey, Chilliwack, Vancouver and right across B.C., and I know it will contribute to a strong, connected community here in Maple Ridge."" New research released from housing operators of the first seven modular supportive housing buildings in Vancouver and Surrey provides evidence of the value of these buildings. The research found that the housing-first model employed by BC Housing is substantially improving the quality of life of residents, as people experiencing homelessness are provided with a stable place to live and the wraparound services they need. The reports summarize data collected six months after the buildings opened. ""These results show that our approach is working,"" Robinson said. ""When people have a place to call home, surrounded by the care and supports they need, they feel the dignity, confidence and hope needed to be able to make positive change in their lives."" Coast Mental Health will operate the building, named Garibaldi Ridge, and provide 24/7 on-site support to the residents. The three-storey wood-frame building has indoor amenity space, a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge area, laundry, clinical space and storage areas. Supports for residents include outreach workers, wellness checks, life-skills training, employment programs and referrals to community services and support groups. Residents will be connected to primary health care as well as mental health and addiction recovery services. Coast Mental Health will employ 16 full- time support workers, including an on-site program manager and metal health workers, who will assess residents and provide referrals to Fraser Health Authority and other clinical programming. At least two staff members will be on-site at all times. ""Coast Mental Health continues to grow because of our specialized expertise and community- based support services in mental health,"" Darrell Burnham, CEO, Coast Mental Health. ""We take a holistic approach to caring for our clients that includes housing, support services and when our clients are ready, life skills, training and employment. With our community partners, we have made significant strides in reducing homelessness in Maple Ridge, with a total of 150 homes that include on-site 24/7 support services for vulnerable people who proudly call Maple Ridge home."" On-site nursing staff, working closely with Fraser Health Authority, will help residents living with addictions, mental health and physical issues. The nursing staff will split their time between Garibaldi Ridge and three other housing facilities (Royal Crescent Modular, Alouette Heights and Timber Grove Apartments) operated by Coast Mental Health in the Fraser Valley region. ""Living at Maple Ridge Modular, I have no stress, no depression, I'm working and I'm happier and healthier,"" said AJ, a resident at Maple Ridge Modular on Royal Crescent. ""My life is just happier today because I have a safe place to sleep. I also appreciate having a regular meal. These are basic needs that provide stability in my life so I can move forward."" The housing was manufactured by Horizon North. The modular design allows it to be installed at the Burnett site temporarily and then moved to a different location. The Province is working with the City of Maple Ridge on securing a permanent location for the housing. Once a site is found, the housing will be moved and work will begin on new affordable seniors' housing at the Burnett site. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

New research released from housing operators of the first seven modular supportive housing buildings in Vancouver and Surrey provides evidence of the value of these buildings. The research found that the housing-first model employed by BC Housing is substantially improving the quality of life of residents, as people experiencing homelessness are provided with a stable place to live and the wraparound services they need. The reports summarize data collected six months after the buildings opened. ""These results show that our approach is working,"" Robinson said. ""When people have a place to call home, surrounded by the care and supports they need, they feel the dignity, confidence and hope needed to be able to make positive change in their lives."" Coast Mental Health will operate the building, named Garibaldi Ridge, and provide 24/7 on-site support to the residents. The three-storey wood-frame building has indoor amenity space, a commercial kitchen, dining and lounge area, laundry, clinical space and storage areas. Supports for residents include outreach workers, wellness checks, life-skills training, employment programs and referrals to community services and support groups. Residents will be connected to primary health care as well as mental health and addiction recovery services. Coast Mental Health will employ 16 full- time support workers, including an on-site program manager and metal health workers, who will assess residents and provide referrals to Fraser Health Authority and other clinical programming. At least two staff members will be on-site at all times. ""Coast Mental Health continues to grow because of our specialized expertise and community- based support services in mental health,"" Darrell Burnham, CEO, Coast Mental Health. ""We take a holistic approach to caring for our clients that includes housing, support services and when our clients are ready, life skills, training and employment. With our community partners, we have made significant strides in reducing homelessness in Maple Ridge, with a total of 150 homes that include on-site 24/7 support services for vulnerable people who proudly call Maple Ridge home."" On-site nursing staff, working closely with Fraser Health Authority, will help residents living with addictions, mental health and physical issues. The nursing staff will split their time between Garibaldi Ridge and three other housing facilities (Royal Crescent Modular, Alouette Heights and Timber Grove Apartments) operated by Coast Mental Health in the Fraser Valley region. ""Living at Maple Ridge Modular, I have no stress, no depression, I'm working and I'm happier and healthier,"" said AJ, a resident at Maple Ridge Modular on Royal Crescent. ""My life is just happier today because I have a safe place to sleep. I also appreciate having a regular meal. These are basic needs that provide stability in my life so I can move forward."" The housing was manufactured by Horizon North. The modular design allows it to be installed at the Burnett site temporarily and then moved to a different location. The Province is working with the City of Maple Ridge on securing a permanent location for the housing. Once a site is found, the housing will be moved and work will begin on new affordable seniors' housing at the Burnett site. Delivering affordable housing is a shared priority between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement.

The proposed mixed-use development would be located on First Avenue at the current location of NR Motors. BC Housing would lead the construction of the project, to be built in two phases. The first phase would include approximately 50 supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness and the second phase would include 50 affordable rental homes for low- to moderate-income individuals and families. Experienced non-profit housing providers would be selected to oversee the day-to-day management of both buildings. Each building would include ground-floor health-care space that would deliver services for both residents and the public. Northern Health, in partnership with other health-service agencies, would oversee these spaces and provide primary care, harm reduction and specialized mental health and substance-use services. The proposed project addresses recommendations in Northern Health’s 2017 downtown health-services plan. The city has an agreement with NR Motors to purchase the property, subject to rezoning, an amendment to the official community plan, environmental and geotechnical review, and project approval. According to NR Motors, the company has outgrown its current site and is planning to move to a different location. The proposed project is in an early phase of planning. A municipal rezoning process is planned for fall 2019, offering opportunities for stakeholders and the community to provide input. Quotes: Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing —“This project is a great example of how we’re working with partners to make life better for people in Prince George. People should be able to find affordable housing that works for them, close to the health-care services they count on, and that’s what this project will deliver.” Judy Darcy, Minister of Mental Health and Addictions —“When people have stable housing and access to supports when and where they need them, it benefits the entire community. This project will offer people in Prince George wraparound services in a safe and secure environment, so they can focus on a pathway to healing and to hope.” Lyn Hall, mayor, City of Prince George —“I would like to express my appreciation to Northern Health and BC Housing for partnering with the city to explore real options for improving our downtown for everyone. Just the fact these three organizations are working together is quite innovative and encouraging, and positions Prince George for meaningful change. The partners will now work together to provide the community with more information about the proposal together with opportunities for public input, leading up to a rezoning process later this fall.” Colleen Nyce, board chair, Northern Health —“With the City of Prince George, BC Housing and our many health-service partners, we are taking a bold step in addressing some of the challenges that we are facing in the downtown.

Projected monthly rental rates will range between $375 and $1,440. “Through the Community Housing Fund, we are addressing gaps in the market, creating the types of homes that people can afford – from growing families to seniors on fixed incomes,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “And our progress to date has been made possible because of the commitment of partners like Lower Similkameen Community Services Society.” Located at 715 - 7th St., the proposed project will be designed to include one-, two- and three-bedroom units, including several accessible homes. The three-storey building will also have commercial space on the ground floor for the society’s community service programs and offices. “The Village of Keremeos very much appreciates the investment the Province is making to provide for more affordable housing in Keremeos,” said Manfred Bauer, mayor, Village of Keremeos. “Council will continue to support this collaborative approach and is looking forward to future projects.” The society has recently purchased land for the project, which will go through a rezoning process. A public information session will be held as part of that process in July 2019. Construction is expected to start in spring 2020. “On behalf of the communities of Keremeos, Cawston, Hedley and Olalla, Lower Similkameen Community Services Society is honoured to partner with the Province and the Village of Keremeos to develop more affordable housing in our community under the Community Housing Fund,” said Sarah Martin, executive director, Lower Similkameen Community Services Society. “The social, health and economic benefits of affordable housing for individuals, families and communities are well known. Through our work providing a diversity of programs and services within the community, we are acutely aware of the need for more affordable housing units, across the demographics. We are grateful for this opportunity to provide more safe, affordable and adaptive homes for our community members.” This project is part of more than 20,000 new homes completed or underway throughout B.C. as a result of provincial investments, including more than 5,000 homes in mixed-income buildings for people with a range of low, moderate and middle incomes through the Community Housing Fund.

The proposed project would provide approximately 50 new affordable rental homes for Indigenous peoples, as well as 50 new supportive homes for Downtown Eastside residents. ""There is a critical need for better housing for Indigenous peoples in British Columbia, as they are consistently over represented in homeless counts, including the recent count in Vancouver,"" said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""Reconciliation means continuing to work in partnership with Indigenous leaders, housing providers and First Nations to build the right mix of affordable homes for Indigenous peoples in communities around B.C."" Located at 52-92 East Hastings St., the mixed-use development would include a safe and inclusive healing centre that is accessible to all. Operated by the Vancouver Native Health Society, the healing centre would be guided by a holistic approach to wellness, focused on the spiritual, emotional, physical and mental elements of well-being that blends Indigenous and western medicine. ""We are honoured to be part of such an innovative project that will meet the needs of so many people,"" said Claire Marshall, president, Aboriginal Land Trust. ""We are pleased to be partnering with BC Housing and such a diverse group of agencies, such as Vancouver Native Health Society, Lu'ma Native Housing Society and RainCity."" The new affordable rental apartments for low-income Indigenous individuals and families would be operated by Lu'ma Native Housing Society. ""The announcement of new housing is a testament to the organizations and people calling for safe, affordable homes in the Downtown Eastside,"" said Melanie Mark, MLA for Vancouver- Mount Pleasant. ""Our government is working with on-the-ground organizations to build strong partnerships to support families, tackle poverty and grow strong, resilient communities."" The site is currently home to the Shaldon Hotel, an aging supportive housing project, the Downtown Eastside Street Market, an overdose prevention site and Pigeon Park Savings, operated by Vancity. All existing occupants at the site are being assisted with alternate accommodation and, if the project goes ahead, BC Housing will work with RainCity Housing to find new homes for all Shaldon Hotel residents during the construction period. Residents would be welcomed back into the modern, new supportive homes when the building is complete, at no increase in rent. RainCity Housing would operate these homes and provide 24/7 support. The Shaldon Hotel at 52 East Hastings St. is designated a heritage site. The project team is meeting with the Vancouver Heritage Commission to discuss the Indigenous heritage of the project site.

People experiencing homelessness deserve the opportunity to build a better life and we will continue to address the need for supportive housing here and in communities throughout the province.” To be located at 130 McCurdy Rd., BC Housing has an agreement to buy 49 housing units from Culos Development Group. Responding to a recommendation made through the City of Kelowna’s Journey Home Strategy, a portion of the housing will be reserved for youth between the ages of 19 and 24 years. “BC Housing has successfully housed thousands of people in supportive housing units across the province, including more than 140 people in Kelowna during the past year,” said Colin Basran, mayor, City of Kelowna. “BC Housing, Interior Health, the City of Kelowna, the Central Okanagan Journey Home Society and community agencies are working together on the urgent need for housing to support the 700 local residents who are either currently homeless or on the waitlist with the BC Housing Supportive Housing Registry.” Canadian Mental Health Association of Kelowna will oversee the day-to-day operations and provide 24/7 support services to residents, including referrals to Interior Health recovery programs where needed. All residents will sign a program agreement, which will detail expected resident behaviours and the building's rules. “Providing homes with appropriate supports is fundamental to supporting the health and well-being for people who may have been homeless for a long time,” said Shelagh Turner, executive director, Canadian Mental Health Association, Kelowna and District Branch. “Housing stability is the first step in clearing the way so people can thrive and move towards an improved quality of life.” The project site is currently home to the Knights of Columbus Hall.

The first round of investments will see more than 300 new homes built through 13 projects in communities throughout the province. “All efforts to assist and improve the lives of those in need are a welcome addition to the available housing supports in Penticton,” said John Vassilaki, mayor, City of Penticton. “This particular project not only provides critical housing, it also creates access to the equally important support services that assist women and their families.” The South Okanagan Women in Need Society (SOWINS) will manage the day-to-day operations and will oversee the resident selection process. Since 1981, the society has offered women and their children a safe place to stay, along with essentials such as food, clothing and toiletries. The society offers women ongoing counselling, support and preventive education programs. “For the first time in Penticton thanks to BC Housing, SOWINS is now able to offer permanent, safe, affordable housing to women and children,” said Debbie Scarborough, executive director, SOWINS. “SOWINS is so excited to hand over the keys to these mums and their children, who now have new, safe and affordable homes.” Residents will receive support services, including access to health services, counselling, resumé building, interview skills and workshops, such as building healthy relationships, financial literacy and self-care. More than 20,000 new homes are completed or underway as a result of provincial investments, including more than 2,600 new supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in British Columbia.

This fund, a $734-million investment over 10 years, will build 1,500 transition housing, second-stage housing, and long-term housing spaces for women and children leaving violence. The first round of investments will see more than 300 new homes built through 13 projects in communities throughout the province. “All efforts to assist and improve the lives of those in need are a welcome addition to the available housing supports in Penticton,” said John Vassilaki, mayor, City of Penticton. “This particular project not only provides critical housing, it also creates access to the equally important support services that assist women and their families.” The South Okanagan Women in Need Society (SOWINS) will manage the day-to-day operations and will oversee the resident selection process. Since 1981, the society has offered women and their children a safe place to stay, along with essentials such as food, clothing and toiletries. The society offers women ongoing counselling, support and preventive education programs. “For the first time in Penticton thanks to BC Housing, SOWINS is now able to offer permanent, safe, affordable housing to women and children,” said Debbie Scarborough, executive director, SOWINS. “SOWINS is so excited to hand over the keys to these mums and their children, who now have new, safe and affordable homes.” Residents will receive support services, including access to health services, counselling, resumé building, interview skills and workshops, such as building healthy relationships, financial literacy and self-care. More than 20,000 new homes are completed or underway as a result of provincial investments, including more than 2,600 new supportive homes for people experiencing homelessness in British Columbia.

The Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services Society is developing the affordable rental housing, offering 31 new homes that will co-house Elders with First Nations, Inuit and Métis youth (ages 16-27). This housing is unique in Kamloops and one of only a few housing projects in B.C. that offers a continuum of affordable housing for Indigenous youth during and after they receive services from the child welfare system. “Too many Indigenous people, including youth and Elders, don’t have access to the affordable housing they need,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are working with Indigenous partners to build safe and secure homes where Indigenous youth and Elders can build relationships and create a sense of belonging in a culturally appropriate setting.” In honour of the territory of the Tk’emlups te Secwepemc, the new building will be named Kikékyelc: A Place of Belonging. In Secwepemctsin, this means to cover young protectively — as in how birds wrap wings around their young. The homes follow a culturally appropriate building design and will help to grow an informal network of support between generations, while addressing the immediate need for affordable rental housing in the community. Support workers will also be on site to assist youth with family and cultural connections, life skills development and other specialized care needs, as well as to support Elders in their mentorship role. Located at 975 Singh St., the City of Kamloops leased the land to BC Housing for a 60-year term to support Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services’ housing project.

This complements the work we are doing to change the way we help our youth, so they don’t age out of care unsupported and into homelessness.” Colleen Lucier, executive director, Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services —“While we are excited and honoured to have this opportunity to develop this unique housing option for First Nations, Inuit and Métis young people, Kikékyelc: A Place of Belonging, is not a success story, but rather a response to the legacy of trauma our People have experienced. By offering a culturally safe, supported and affordable housing option to First Nation, Inuit and Métis youth, we hope to contribute to reconciliation by restoring traditional ways of caring for young people, strengthening their sense of belonging and reminding them of their capabilities, beauty and resilience so that they can move forward as proud, loving and generous members of society, just as their ancestors were. As a Métis child and family services agency, this is what our Elders have called us to do.” Ken Christian, mayor, City of Kamloops —“The City of Kamloops is proud to support the Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services Society, in partnership with BC Housing, with this exceptional housing project.

This complements the work we are doing to change the way we help our youth, so they don’t age out of care unsupported and into homelessness.” Colleen Lucier, executive director, Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services —“While we are excited and honoured to have this opportunity to develop this unique housing option for First Nations, Inuit and Métis young people, Kikékyelc: A Place of Belonging, is not a success story, but rather a response to the legacy of trauma our People have experienced. By offering a culturally safe, supported and affordable housing option to First Nation, Inuit and Métis youth, we hope to contribute to reconciliation by restoring traditional ways of caring for young people, strengthening their sense of belonging and reminding them of their capabilities, beauty and resilience so that they can move forward as proud, loving and generous members of society, just as their ancestors were. As a Métis child and family services agency, this is what our Elders have called us to do.” Ken Christian, mayor, City of Kamloops —“The City of Kamloops is proud to support the Lii Michif Otipemisiwak Family and Community Services Society, in partnership with BC Housing, with this exceptional housing project. The opportunity to co-house First Nations, Inuit and Métis youth and Elders offers an environment of teaching and mentoring that is incredibly unique and is sure to be a great success.” Facts: Learn A map showing the location of all announced projects is now available A backgrounder follows.

Building affordable rental housing is part of the Province’s strategy to address housing affordability. Government is curbing speculation in B.C.’s housing market and building 114,000 affordable homes over 10 years around the province. “The Knox Centre is part of our government’s work to make life more affordable for everyone in B.C.,” said Premier John Horgan, MLA for Langford-Juan de Fuca. “For years, too many families and seniors in Sooke and throughout the province have struggled to find safe homes with rents they could afford. Our government is making different choices – choices that put people first.” Located at 2110 Church Rd. in Sooke, the Knox Centre provides 42 homes, including two one-bedroom accessible units and three one-bedroom adaptable units, for low- to moderate-income individuals, families and seniors. Government provided approximately $5.35 million in capital funding and construction financing for the project. The Knox Centre project is a partnership between the Province, Knox Presbyterian Church, Knox Vision Society and the District of Sooke. Knox Vision Society is operating the five-storey building. The society was established by Knox Presbyterian Church in 2008 to help the community address the need for affordable housing. The church provided the land for the development, which is valued at approximately $1.3 million. The building was designed and built to Step 3 of the BC Energy Step Code for residential buildings. This supports the Province’s CleanBC goal of a net-zero, energy-ready Building Code by 2032. “This decade-long project has been a labour of love by committed parishioners, “said Eleanor Shambrook, chair, Knox Vision Society. “With the help of the Government of B.C., BC Housing, Sooke District Council and many individuals, including the dedicated development and construction teams, our vision has been brought to fruition and 42 Sooke families now enjoy affordable, energy efficient housing.” The building will also help bring the community together, with a café space for lease on the main floor, as well as a church office and community amenity space. The District of Sooke waived development cost charges and permit fees for the project totalling approximately $208,000. School District 61 also waived $23,000 in fees. “We are grateful for every partnership that results in accessible, affordable homes in our community,” said Maja Tait, mayor, District of Sooke. “The designers and builders are applauded for their accomplishment in progressive climate change action implementing the BC Energy Step Code. We are proud to have this positive development in our town core.” Monthly rental rates range between $875 for a one-bedroom unit and $1,300 for a three-bedroom unit.

The rate structure for the rentals will include 20% at the provincial shelter rate ($375), 50% at rent that is geared to income and 30% will be near market rate. The project is a collaboration between government, business and community partners. Nelson CARES Society is receiving $4.5 million from the Province to help build the housing project. The City of Nelson is providing approximately $27,000 and Columbia Basin Trust is providing $542,400. Culos Developments Group will build the complex. Site preparation for the development has started. Completion is estimated for fall 2020. The development is part of the first series of projects selected to receive funding through the Province's Building BC: Community Housing Fund, a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years, to build more than 14,000 affordable rental homes for seniors, families and low- and middle- income earners. Delivering affordable housing is a shared commitment between government and the BC Green Party caucus and is part of the Confidence and Supply Agreement. Quotes: John Dooley, mayor, City of Nelson - ""I would like to thank the provincial government for bringing the capital dollars to the table that make projects such as this viable. I would also like to thank Nelson CARES for its ongoing commitment in providing affordable housing in our community. The key partnerships they have fostered over the years, including that of the city, have been critical to their success and I am pleased they are adding more affordable housing units to our inventory here in Nelson."" Johnny Strilaeff, president and CEO, Columbia Basin Trust - ""We know that a range of housing options is essential for healthy and resilient communities. Our priority is to help ensure residents have access to housing that meets their needs, and thanks to the hard work of the Nelson CARES Society, 43 families and seniors will soon have access to new, affordable housing in Nelson."" Jenny Robinson, executive director, Nelson CARES Society - ""Nelson has had a 0% vacancy rate for five years, one of the lowest in the province. This has seriously eroded affordability in the community. These new units, subsidized through BC Housing, will make a big difference in the community. We are very excited to get them built."" Michael A. Culos, president, Culos Developments Group - ""We are honoured to partner with the provincial and local governments, Columbia Basin Trust and the Nelson CARES Society to develop this much-needed housing in the community of Nelson.""

""Our goal is to quickly get people into housing where they can get the help and support they've long been needing, while working to close the camp in a managed way,"" said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. ""When we build housing for people who are homeless, the positive impacts don't end with the people being housed. The benefits extend into the community to the neighbours, businesses, first responders and everyone impacted by the camp."" Coast Mental Health will be the building operator, providing 24-hour supports for residents who will have self-contained suites with washrooms and kitchenettes. Fraser Health will also provide clinical support services for the residents on an as-needed basis. Other supports include counselling, life skills and employment programming, as well as daily meals. ""We look forward to collaborating with the Province and the City of Maple Ridge to ensure the design and operations of the Burnett site meet the needs of the community,"" says Darrell Burnham, CEO, Coast Mental Health. ""As the operator of two supportive housing sites in Maple Ridge, we recognize the importance in building homes with support services that encourage healthy and inclusive communities."" The 51 units and a medical room will provide sufficient space for the 47 people experiencing homelessness who, until recently, were residing at the camp. This number has been confirmed by BC Housing and community partners, and BC Housing staff will work with city staff to ensure the names on the city's list are all included in the full list. BC Housing has estimated that it will take approximately five months to complete the new building once construction begins in April. Robinson has written to the Maple Ridge mayor and council to ask city staff to sit down with BC Housing staff to determine how best to support these people in the community until the housing can be completed. BC Housing will continue to keep the shelter at 22239 Lougheed Highway open until the end of the lease on March 31, 2019, to allow time for these conversations. ""We need to put in place a plan to support these people until the homes can be completed,"" said Robinson. ""Without a plan, we risk leaving desperate people no choice but to create another tent city or to scatter throughout the community, neither of which is in the best interests of either the campers or the community of Maple Ridge as a whole."" The housing at the provincially owned Burnett Street site will be manufactured by Horizon North and will be based on the modular designs used in Vancouver. This will allow it to be installed at the Burnett site temporarily and then moved to a different location. In line with the proposal in the city's social housing plan, Robinson has informed the mayor that BC Housing staff will begin work with the city on the design of the new affordable seniors' housing to be built at the Burnett site, so that construction can proceed as soon as a permanent home for the supportive housing units has been found.

224,https://news.bchousing.org/more-than-600-supportive-homes-open-in-vancouver/,03-03-2019,More than 600 supportive homes open in Vancouver,"VANCOUVER – Hundreds of people experiencing homelessness in Vancouver now have warm, safe places to live, as the doors open on the final set of temporary modular homes the Province committed to funding in the city in fall 2017. The Province and the City of Vancouver celebrated the grand opening of Nora Hendrix Place as part of the B.C. government’s commitment to build more than 2,000 supportive homes throughout the province, including 600 in partnership with the City of Vancouver. “Working together towards a common purpose, we can achieve true progress. This is clear in how our partnership with the City of Vancouver has brought more than 600 people in off the streets and into new homes and a hopeful future,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are seeing the transformative power of housing for people in Vancouver, and we will continue to work with communities and partners to help people struggling with homelessness, here and throughout British Columbia.” The 52 new homes at 258 Union St. were built by B.C. manufacturer Horizon North. Each unit is 29.7 square metres (320 square feet) with a bathroom and kitchen. Six of the units are fully wheelchair accessible. The supportive housing will be managed by the PHS Community Services Society, an experienced non-profit housing operator. Hogan’s Alley Society, a non-profit organization dedicated to redressing the displacement of the Black community from Strathcona, is partnering with PHS to help ensure the success of Nora Hendrix Place. Like other supportive housing developments under the Building BC: Rapid Response to Homelessness program, the building offers residents round-the-clock services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work.

The Province and the City of Vancouver celebrated the grand opening of Nora Hendrix Place as part of the B.C. government’s commitment to build more than 2,000 supportive homes throughout the province, including 600 in partnership with the City of Vancouver. “Working together towards a common purpose, we can achieve true progress. This is clear in how our partnership with the City of Vancouver has brought more than 600 people in off the streets and into new homes and a hopeful future,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “We are seeing the transformative power of housing for people in Vancouver, and we will continue to work with communities and partners to help people struggling with homelessness, here and throughout British Columbia.” The 52 new homes at 258 Union St. were built by B.C. manufacturer Horizon North. Each unit is 29.7 square metres (320 square feet) with a bathroom and kitchen. Six of the units are fully wheelchair accessible. The supportive housing will be managed by the PHS Community Services Society, an experienced non-profit housing operator.

With this land, we will be able to work closely with the city, residents and local businesses to create housing that benefits people, local businesses and the entire community.” BC Housing will work with the city, local partners and the surrounding community to develop a comprehensive strategy to deliver much-needed affordable housing for families, seniors and youth working in the area. “The board recognizes the capacity and resources that BC Housing can bring to bear in support of housing in our community and we are pleased that one of the board’s sites can support this initiative in our community,” said Bill MacFarlane, chair, Revelstoke Board of Education. “We are confident that this work will build on the earlier community consultations done by our board.” In the next few months, BC Housing will issue a request for proposals for a planning consultant to lead the public engagement and concept development for the site.

The Province and the City of Vancouver celebrated their partnership at the grand opening of the 52-unit project, part of the British Columbia government’s commitment to build more than 2,000 supportive homes throughout the province, with 600 of those in Vancouver. The new homes at 265 West 1st Ave. were built by B.C. manufacturer, Horizon North. Each unit will be 30 square metres (320 square feet) with a bathroom and kitchen. Six of the units will be fully wheelchair accessible. “These homes are much more than just a place to sleep. These homes represent new beginnings and new opportunities for a better life,” said Spencer Chandra Herbert, MLA for Vancouver-West End. “Partnering with local farms, this project will also give residents and neighbours a chance to learn new skills and help others in their community. We all benefit when we help each other when in need.” Like other supportive housing developments under the Building BC: Rapid Response to Homelessness program, the project offers residents round-the-clock services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work. “This latest building means that 52 more people in Vancouver will have a safe, warm place to call home,” said Mayor Kennedy Stewart, City of Vancouver. “Temporary modular housing provides immediate relief for those experiencing homelessness, and today’s opening means that over 550 new homes are now complete. We are grateful for our partnership with the Province and the tireless work of local non-profit organizations to deliver this critical housing, along with the important health and social services that will be provided on-site.” The housing will be managed by the PHS Community Services Society, an experienced non-profit housing operator. Sole Food Street Farms, an urban farming project that transforms vacant urban land into street farms, will also offer training to tenants interested in learning more about growing quality fruits and vegetables, which are sold at farmer’s markets, local restaurants and retail outlets. The food grown will be used in meals served at the building. The new homes bring the number of completed modular supportive homes built throughout the province to more than 800. A further 1,200 are underway as part of the Building BC: Rapid Response to Homelessness program, which will deliver more than 2,000 modular supportive homes in 22 communities. Quotes: Andy Bond, executive director, PHS Community Services Society –“For over 25 years, PHS has advocated for holistic communities where even the most marginalized citizens are able to connect and participate in their health and well-being in a dignified and meaningful way. PHS is proud to see aspects of that vision come to fruition at 265 West 1st. We’re excited to welcome 52 people to their new homes and partner with Sole Food Street Farms to explore the urban farm’s positive impact on the community at 265 West 1st.""

The Province, BC Housing and the City of Burnaby are partnering on the Hall Towers redevelopment project. The project includes one provincially owned site and three sites owned by the city at 7282 and 7252 Kingsway and 7255 Edmonds St. – previously the Edmonds 55+ Community Centre and the Kingsway branch library precinct. The sites will eventually include high-density, mixed-use affordable rental housing, new market housing, commercial space, community services and public amenities. “Our government is committed to making sure that people with low incomes, including seniors and people living with disabilities, can find a home that meets their needs at a price they can afford,” said Raj Chouhan, MLA for Burnaby-Edmonds. “Working with our partners, we will provide safer and more comfortable homes for Hall Towers residents, without adding to their monthly rent. I look forward to seeing how these sites develop in the long term to build a vibrant community with the homes that people in Burnaby want and need.” Built in the Edmonds Town Centre neighbourhood in the 1970s, Hall Towers is home to 342 people and needs substantial renovations to meet today’s sustainable design, engineering and construction standards. “We are so pleased to be advancing this important project with the Province of British Columbia and BC Housing,” said Mike Hurley, mayor, City of Burnaby. “The new units will replace old affordable housing stock by providing brand new homes for all of the tenants in the existing buildings at no additional cost to them, while increasing the total number of affordable rental homes in the Edmonds Town Centre neighbourhood.” People living at Hall Towers will remain in their homes during construction and, once the new units are complete, tenants will have the option to move into the redeveloped housing.

A further 1,400 units are underway as part of the Rapid Response to Homelessness program, which will deliver more than 2,000 modular supportive homes for people who need them. Larwill Place, located at 610/620 Cambie St., provides 98 units within two three-storey buildings. MPA Society will manage and operate both buildings.

237,https://news.bchousing.org/new-affordable-housing-to-help-port-alberni-seniors/,23-11-2018,New affordable housing to help Port Alberni seniors,"PORT ALBERNI – Seniors in Port Alberni will soon have access to additional affordable rental housing and long-term care so they can receive the services they need and continue to live in the community as they age. Two new projects at the Tsawaayuus Care Facility are under construction as part of a partnership between the Province, Island Health, the Aboriginal Housing Management Association, Westcoast Native Health Care Society, the Nuu-chah-nulth Economic Development Corporation and the City of Port Alberni. “Too many seniors in Port Alberni are struggling to keep up with the rising housing costs,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “I am proud that our government is working with community partners to ensure seniors have access to safe and affordable housing in our community.” The first project is a new independent living building with 20 one-bedroom units for low- income seniors, being built next to the existing Tsawaayuus Care Facility. The independent living building will incorporate scooter parking, programming space, common areas and a community kitchen for residents. The second project is a new extension to the Tsawaayuus Care Facility, which will create an additional 13 long-term care beds, 12 of which will be subsidized by Island Health. The care facility and new independent living building will be connected by a pedestrian pathway to ensure mobility within the campus for residents and patients. The new beds are part of the Ministry of Health’s commitment to seniors’ care in the province, which will see $240 million invested over three years to increase staffing levels in residential care homes. “The new long-term care beds in Port Alberni will mean more seniors can stay closer to their friends and family and remain connected to their community,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We know that maintaining connections to the people and places they love helps seniors enjoy the quality of life they deserve.” The Tsawaayuus Care Facility is operated by the Westcoast Native Health Care Society. The care facility currently has 30 publicly subsidized beds and one privately funded complex-care bed. The new beds will enhance capacity and provide 24-hour professional care and supervision to adults in a supportive and secure environment. Both developments are expected to be ready for occupancy by late 2019. Quotes: Sharie Minions, mayor, City of Port Alberni – “With an aging and diversifying population, seniors' housing in Port Alberni has become a growing issue that is in need of action. By partnering on this project, the City of Port Alberni is sending a strong message that safe and affordable housing is a priority. Our seniors are the foundation to this community and we must help ensure they are receiving the care and attention they need to lead a happy and healthy life today, tomorrow and for the many years to come.” Leah Hollins, board chair, Island Health – “We welcome the opportunity to work with the Westcoast Native Health Care Society to open more beds. The expansion will provide our aging population with more options so they can continue to call the Alberni Valley home.” Daniel Watts, president, Westcoast Native Health Care Society – “All of us at Tsawaayuus (Rainbow Gardens) are excited about adding to our ‘campus of care.’ We are proud to be the organization that will increase seniors' independently living units and complex care beds for people in the Alberni Valley and the West Coast.” Margaret Pfoh, chief executive officer, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) – “The Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens are outstanding members of AHMA who have compassionately cared for so many Indigenous elders.

Two new projects at the Tsawaayuus Care Facility are under construction as part of a partnership between the Province, Island Health, the Aboriginal Housing Management Association, Westcoast Native Health Care Society, the Nuu-chah-nulth Economic Development Corporation and the City of Port Alberni. “Too many seniors in Port Alberni are struggling to keep up with the rising housing costs,” said Scott Fraser, MLA for Mid Island-Pacific Rim. “I am proud that our government is working with community partners to ensure seniors have access to safe and affordable housing in our community.” The first project is a new independent living building with 20 one-bedroom units for low- income seniors, being built next to the existing Tsawaayuus Care Facility. The independent living building will incorporate scooter parking, programming space, common areas and a community kitchen for residents. The second project is a new extension to the Tsawaayuus Care Facility, which will create an additional 13 long-term care beds, 12 of which will be subsidized by Island Health. The care facility and new independent living building will be connected by a pedestrian pathway to ensure mobility within the campus for residents and patients. The new beds are part of the Ministry of Health’s commitment to seniors’ care in the province, which will see $240 million invested over three years to increase staffing levels in residential care homes. “The new long-term care beds in Port Alberni will mean more seniors can stay closer to their friends and family and remain connected to their community,” said Adrian Dix, Minister of Health. “We know that maintaining connections to the people and places they love helps seniors enjoy the quality of life they deserve.” The Tsawaayuus Care Facility is operated by the Westcoast Native Health Care Society. The care facility currently has 30 publicly subsidized beds and one privately funded complex-care bed. The new beds will enhance capacity and provide 24-hour professional care and supervision to adults in a supportive and secure environment. Both developments are expected to be ready for occupancy by late 2019. Quotes: Sharie Minions, mayor, City of Port Alberni – “With an aging and diversifying population, seniors' housing in Port Alberni has become a growing issue that is in need of action. By partnering on this project, the City of Port Alberni is sending a strong message that safe and affordable housing is a priority. Our seniors are the foundation to this community and we must help ensure they are receiving the care and attention they need to lead a happy and healthy life today, tomorrow and for the many years to come.” Leah Hollins, board chair, Island Health – “We welcome the opportunity to work with the Westcoast Native Health Care Society to open more beds. The expansion will provide our aging population with more options so they can continue to call the Alberni Valley home.” Daniel Watts, president, Westcoast Native Health Care Society – “All of us at Tsawaayuus (Rainbow Gardens) are excited about adding to our ‘campus of care.’ We are proud to be the organization that will increase seniors' independently living units and complex care beds for people in the Alberni Valley and the West Coast.” Margaret Pfoh, chief executive officer, Aboriginal Housing Management Association (AHMA) – “The Tsawaayuus Rainbow Gardens are outstanding members of AHMA who have compassionately cared for so many Indigenous elders. Their commitment and dedication to the Port Alberni and surrounding Indigenous community continues to make positive and meaningful change.

Premier Horgan made the announcement at the grand opening of Phase 1, which added 73 new homes. “Housing is the foundation of healthy families and strong communities, but too many people in B.C. are without access to the safe, secure and affordable housing everyone needs,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “By investing in projects such as Oak Park, we are helping families struggling today and making sure we have affordable homes for generations to come.” The $8 million in funding for Phase 2 are part of the Province’s new Building BC: Community Housing Fund, a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years to build more than 14,000 affordable rental homes for middle-income households, seniors and people with low incomes. The first set of projects, announced on Nov. 13, 2018, includes 4,902 homes in 42 communities throughout B.C. to be built over the next two to three years. The child care facility, operated by Atira Women’s Resource Centre, is planned to provide full-time spaces for 12 infants and toddlers and 24 spaces for three- to five-year-olds. “This project is a great example of how partnerships can deliver innovative solutions to create new child care spaces across B.C.,” said Katrina Chen, Minister of State for Child Care. “Incorporating affordable, quality child care into the Oak Park redevelopment project will help parents return to the workforce and give their children the best start to their early years and beyond.” The Oak Park redevelopment will be completed in partnership with Pacifica Housing and the City of Langford, and will provide 153 new affordable rental homes for low-to moderate- income individuals, families, seniors and people with disabilities.

239,https://news.bchousing.org/bc-to-improve-social-housing-while-reducing-pollution/,22-11-2018,"B.C. to improve social housing, while reducing pollution","VICTORIA – The British Columbia government will invest $1.1 billion over the next 10 years to make B.C.’s social housing stock more energy efficient, less polluting and safer, while significantly reducing heating costs for residents. In making the announcement, Premier John Horgan said the major focus of the retrofit initiative will be to increase the use of cleaner electricity in the province’s 51,000 units of publicly funded and owned social housing. As a result, some buildings may reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50%. “As part of tackling climate change here in B.C., we need to change how we heat our homes,” Premier Horgan said. “By retrofitting the homes of tens of thousands of British Columbians, we’ll reduce air pollution at the same time we’re reducing people’s heating bills.” The $1.1-billion retrofit initiative is part of the B.C. government’s 30-point housing plan, released in the last provincial budget. Within this, the energy-efficiency component is budgeted at $400 million and is part of government’s upcoming strategy to meet B.C.’s legislated climate goals. It will include upgrades that improve building efficiency and reduce energy use – like boiler and electrical upgrades, replacing doors and windows, building-envelope repair, electrical upgrades and more. “This investment is a great example of how reducing emissions improves quality of life and affordability for British Columbians,” said Andrew Weaver, MLA for Oak Bay-Gordon Head and leader of the B.C. Green caucus, who joined Premier Horgan in making the announcement. “Making our buildings more energy efficient will also provide opportunities for the trades and construction industry to develop their expertise in low-carbon solutions. Creating these kinds of opportunities will help drive local innovation that will benefit the entire provincial economy.” In addition to the efficiencies created, the broader retrofit initiative will deliver significant seismic and fire-safety upgrades, making homes safer and more comfortable for residents. It will also create approximately 7,700 direct and indirect B.C. jobs. “B.C.’s social housing is a critical piece of solving the housing crisis we’re seeing in all parts of the province,” Premier Horgan said. “In addition to building more housing, we must take better care of the homes we have already. This is an investment in the families and seniors who live in social housing. It’s an investment in their safety, comfort and ability to afford the homes they want.” Residents of Victoria’s Ashlar Manor, a 49-unit building for low-income seniors and persons with disabilities, attended the announcement. It is anticipated the upgrades to that building will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50%. Quotes: Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing – “Renovating existing affordable homes is an overdue investment in our future and offers significant opportunities to upgrade seismic, life safety, accessibility and energy performance. What this means for tenants is they have a better quality of housing at a rent they can afford.” George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy – “By ramping up funding for renovations and retrofits, we’re making thousands of units more comfortable and more efficient, while cutting our carbon pollution. We’re also helping people to lower their bills and make their homes more comfortable. It’s a win-win that helps us to build new skills, invest in people and make our communities stronger.” Christine Culham, senior manager, Capital Region Housing Corporation (CRHC) – “The CRHC is pleased to see the direct benefit the retrofit funding will provide for the residents of Ashlar Manor and across the province.

The Province is partnering with the City of Kamloops, ASK Wellness Society, Interior Health Authority, Community Living BC and Arpa Investments to develop a new multi-use complex that will provide 43 units of new affordable rental housing. “There is a critical need for affordable housing for people in Kamloops. The Spirit Square revitalization project, along with the 200 affordable homes in the three projects announced Tuesday, will help meet that need,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “When we build housing that’s affordable it doesn’t just help the new tenants, it lifts the entire region up.” Twenty-eight of the units will be designated for singles, seniors, persons with disabilities and people with mental-health issues living independently. The remaining 15 units will be reserved for people living with mental-health issues and receiving clinic care through Royal Inland Hospital. The affordable units will be managed by the ASK Wellness Society, a respected local non-profit with considerable experience managing affordable rental housing and success working with people living with mental-health issues. The redeveloped complex will also feature a building with 33 units of market housing and commercial space for local business owners. The project is scheduled to be complete by spring 2020. Quotes: Ken Christian, mayor, City of Kamloops - “This project is an excellent example of what can happen when partners come together with a common goal of providing opportunities across the affordable housing continuum. This development will not only provide 43 permanent affordable rental homes, but it will also increase the supply of entry-level home ownership, and invigorate this already vibrant neighbourhood.” Bob Hughes, executive director, ASK Wellness Society - “ASK Wellness Society has long believed that the site for this project would be part of the revitalization of a vital part of the community. To join together with the Province of British Columbia, the City of Kamloops and a highly respected and visionary private developer like Arpa Investments to create 43 permanent affordable and safe housing units is truly an honour for our organization.” Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health Authority - “We know that housing is an important social determinant of health. Access to safe and affordable housing is a significant contributing factor to one’s well-being. We look forward to the completion of this project. It will make a great difference in the lives of hundreds of Kamloops residents.” Seonag Macrae, chief executive officer, Community Living BC – “Community Living BC is very pleased to be part of an important collaboration that is increasing inclusive housing options for people with developmental disabilities in Kamloops. We applaud the investment by BC Housing, the vision of the City of Kamloops and the work of Arpa and Ask Wellness Society.

The Province is partnering with the City of Kamloops, ASK Wellness Society, Interior Health Authority, Community Living BC and Arpa Investments to develop a new multi-use complex that will provide 43 units of new affordable rental housing. “There is a critical need for affordable housing for people in Kamloops. The Spirit Square revitalization project, along with the 200 affordable homes in the three projects announced Tuesday, will help meet that need,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “When we build housing that’s affordable it doesn’t just help the new tenants, it lifts the entire region up.” Twenty-eight of the units will be designated for singles, seniors, persons with disabilities and people with mental-health issues living independently. The remaining 15 units will be reserved for people living with mental-health issues and receiving clinic care through Royal Inland Hospital. The affordable units will be managed by the ASK Wellness Society, a respected local non-profit with considerable experience managing affordable rental housing and success working with people living with mental-health issues. The redeveloped complex will also feature a building with 33 units of market housing and commercial space for local business owners. The project is scheduled to be complete by spring 2020. Quotes: Ken Christian, mayor, City of Kamloops - “This project is an excellent example of what can happen when partners come together with a common goal of providing opportunities across the affordable housing continuum. This development will not only provide 43 permanent affordable rental homes, but it will also increase the supply of entry-level home ownership, and invigorate this already vibrant neighbourhood.” Bob Hughes, executive director, ASK Wellness Society - “ASK Wellness Society has long believed that the site for this project would be part of the revitalization of a vital part of the community. To join together with the Province of British Columbia, the City of Kamloops and a highly respected and visionary private developer like Arpa Investments to create 43 permanent affordable and safe housing units is truly an honour for our organization.” Doug Cochrane, board chair, Interior Health Authority - “We know that housing is an important social determinant of health. Access to safe and affordable housing is a significant contributing factor to one’s well-being. We look forward to the completion of this project. It will make a great difference in the lives of hundreds of Kamloops residents.” Seonag Macrae, chief executive officer, Community Living BC – “Community Living BC is very pleased to be part of an important collaboration that is increasing inclusive housing options for people with developmental disabilities in Kamloops.

Much like past investments in co-op and non-profit housing, individual buildings will contain units aimed at a mix of income levels, including homes for middle-income individuals and families, deeply subsidized rentals for seniors and others on fixed incomes, and homes for low-wage workers. “Through the Community Housing Fund, we are building housing so that growing families, aging seniors and low- to moderate-income individuals can afford homes in the communities they live and work in,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These new homes will have life-changing impacts for people and communities right across the province.” The Province’s new Building BC: Community Housing Fund, a $1.9-billion investment over 10 years, will build more than 14,000 affordable rental homes for seniors, families and low- and middle-income earners, with many to include child care. These 4,900 homes, the first set of projects selected through this fund, will include both non-profits and co-ops, and will be built over the next two to three years. “This historic investment in the community housing sector is an investment in British Columbians struggling to find safe, secure and affordable housing, “ said Jill Atkey, CEO, BC Non-Profit Housing Association. “Non-profit housing partners are hard at work turning these dollars into homes and are committed to ensuring that what is affordable in our sector today, will remain affordable for generations to come.” The Province, through BC Housing, selected the first set of projects based on a number of criteria, including targeted clients and the impact the project is expected to have in reducing the community’s affordable rental housing need.

There are now 260 new homes on five sites complete and 346 homes on five other sites at various stages of the development and approval process. “It’s great to see the doors open on another 52 homes, moving us one step closer to our goal of bringing 600 people in off the street and providing them with the supports and resources they need to get back on track,” said Mayor Gregor Robertson, City of Vancouver. “This is about more than providing someone with a roof over their head – this new housing will help to build the sense of pride and stability that comes with being able to call a place home.” The temporary modular building located at 2132 Ash Str. will be staffed 24/7 and provide life enhancing services to residents such as meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work. The building is dedicated to the memory of Margaret Mitchell, who served as the Member of Parliament for Vancouver East for 14 years. She was a pioneer in community development, a tireless advocate for housing, and a fearless activist, supporting people who are living in poverty. She was instrumental in bringing violence against women and domestic abuse into the political spotlight. Created as part of the Province’s Building BC: Rapid Response to Homelessness program, the temporary modular homes will be operated by PHS Community Services. “We would like to thank our partners at BC Housing and the City of Vancouver for working with us to provide housing and services to those most in need, and we are excited to welcome 52 tenants to their new homes,” said Jennifer Breakspear, executive director, PHS Community Services. “Margaret Mitchell worked to make change for a cause that she believed in and, in doing so, helped countless people all over B.C., and Canada. That kind of compassion and tenacity deeply resonates with PHS’ culture of supporting those in need.” The new homes were constructed by B.C. manufacturer Horizon North, and each home contains a bathroom and kitchen. “With modular construction, the timeline for building a housing project can be reduced by 30 to 50%, which means that the gap in accommodation for individuals vulnerable to displacement can be addressed more quickly,” said Rod Graham, president and chief executive officer of Horizon North. “Off-site construction is a fast, effective response to the growing issue of homelessness in communities throughout the province, and we’re happy to be a part of this effort to give vulnerable people the safe, stable environment they need to rebuild their lives.” The B.C. government provided capital funding of $8 million and will provide an annual operating and support service subsidy for M. Mitchell Place. Quick Facts: As part of the Housing Vancouver Strategy, the City has a target of approving 12,000 new units of permanent social and supportive housing over the next 10 years.

That kind of compassion and tenacity deeply resonates with PHS’ culture of supporting those in need.” The new homes were constructed by B.C. manufacturer Horizon North, and each home contains a bathroom and kitchen. “With modular construction, the timeline for building a housing project can be reduced by 30 to 50%, which means that the gap in accommodation for individuals vulnerable to displacement can be addressed more quickly,” said Rod Graham, president and chief executive officer of Horizon North. “Off-site construction is a fast, effective response to the growing issue of homelessness in communities throughout the province, and we’re happy to be a part of this effort to give vulnerable people the safe, stable environment they need to rebuild their lives.” The B.C. government provided capital funding of $8 million and will provide an annual operating and support service subsidy for M. Mitchell Place. Facts: As part of the Housing Vancouver Strategy, the City has a target of approving 12,000 new units of permanent social and supportive housing over the next 10 years.

As part of the British Columbia government’s 30-point housing plan, the Province is expanding the eligibility requirements and increasing the benefits under the Rental Assistance Program and Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters (SAFER). “Too many people aren’t able to enjoy the peace of mind that comes with having secure rental housing,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “They worry each month about how to pay their rent, feed their families and meet their needs. With this change, we are making housing more affordable for low-income families and seniors in communitiesthroughout the province.” Effective Sept. 1, 2018, as a result of increased rent ceilings around the province, more low-income families and seniors will be eligible for additional assistance to help with their monthly payments in the private market. The average monthly payment for SAFER recipients will increase by approximately $78, or 42%, from $187 to $265. Low-income families will also benefit from higher rental-assistance benefits. Under B.C.’s Rental Assistance Program, the maximum gross household income to qualify for benefits is being raised from $35,000 to $40,000. The average monthly subsidy for recipients is increasing by approximately $67, or 17%, from $405 to $472.

Funded under the Building BC: Rapid Response to Homelessness program, 46 homes with supports and services are proposed on the 45000 block of Trethewey Avenue. “Like many communities in the province, the City of Chilliwack is working with our government to address a housing crisis that is negatively impacting people in the community,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “These homes offer the relief people need in order to stabilize, address health issues and regain self-sufficiency.” RainCity Housing has been selected to operate the 46-unit building and provide 24/7 support to tenants. Residents will have their own private units and will be offered services, including life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, meal programs and opportunities for volunteer work. Fraser Health will provide additional support to tenants at the Trethewey Avenue modular housing site through the services of the Chilliwack Intensive Case Management (ICM) team. The team will be located at, and will also support, the previously announced 45944 Yale Road modular housing site. Team members include medical clinicians, Indigenous cultural liaisons, nurses, peer service specialists and community-support workers. They will assist tenants facing complex challenges related to health, substance use, mental health, poverty and education by providing comprehensive assessments, individualized community-based supports and connections to other services. The site requires a rezoning process. BC Housing and project partners will host a public open house on Sept. 11, 2018, from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the Chilliwack Alliance Church, 8700 Young Rd.

The supportive housing we are building in Prince Rupert will open the door to stability and opportunity for people who have been left to struggle alone for too many years.” The new homes will offer people experiencing or at risk of homelessness the stability they need to be able to focus on other aspects of their lives.

The North Coast Transition Society will operate the building and provide residents with access to around-the clock on-site staff and support services, including meal programs, life and employment skills training, health and wellness support services, and opportunities for volunteer work. These new homes are being constructed by a B.C. manufacturer, Horizon North, providing opportunities for local jobs in British Columbia. Site preparation is underway at 1450 Park Ave. on land provided by the City of Prince Rupert. Residents are expected to move into the building by early 2019.

I want to thank the B.C. government for partnering with Vancouver on urgent, effective actions to solve homelessness.” Today’s grand opening marks the latest step taken by the Province and the city towards creating 600 supportive homes in Vancouver. With the opening of Sarah Ross House, 208 new homes on four sites are complete, and approximately 350 homes on five further sites are in various stages of the development process. The building is named in honour of an early resident of the Collingwood neighbourhood, Sarah Ross of the Neskonlith Indian Band, who arrived in Vancouver from Kamloops to escape racism, according to her letters and diaries. She lived in the area with her extended family until her death in the late 1950s. Her family still lives in the neighbourhood. The building will be run by Atira, an experienced non-profit housing operator. “We are thrilled to be managing Sarah Ross House, which will provide critical supportive housing for people in Vancouver and in particular, the Collingwood and Renfrew Heights communities,” says Janice Abbott, CEO, Atira. “We know what a positive difference housing can make in someone’s life and in increasing and improving the health of a community. We look forward to welcoming tenants to their new homes and to becoming an important and contributing part of the neighbourhood.” The new homes at 4480 Kaslo St. were constructed by local B.C. manufacturer, Horizon North. Each home will be 320 square feet and contain a bathroom and kitchen. Six of the units will be fully wheelchair accessible. The building will also include a large amenity space with a commercial kitchen and provide a communal space for the residents to gather. There will also be laundry facilities, a staff room, an office, and meeting rooms for the staff and residents to use.

Passive House standards aim to minimize the energy used for heating and cooling. The housing incorporates design features and technologies that reduce energy use and utility costs for residents and the operator, and improve the comfort and air quality for those living in the building. “By designing these homes to meet Passive House standards, we are providing shelter for British Columbians in a sustainable way, while providing more comfortable and affordable housing,” said George Heyman, Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy. “Encouraging more efficient housing is essential to building a clean-growth economy in B.C.” Harding Heights’ building standards achieve the highest level of the BC Energy Step Code. This is in line with the Province’s goal of going above and beyond the requirements of the BC Building Code in energy-efficiency, moving towards being net-zero energy ready in new construction by 2032. ""The Town of Smithers congratulates BC Housing and the Dik Tiy Housing Society on the completion of their successful project,” said Taylor Bachrach, mayor, Town of Smithers. “Not only does the new building add to the diversity and affordability of housing in Smithers, it also demonstrates climate-action leadership as Smithers' first certified Passive House project. Thank you to BC Housing for this significant investment in our community."" Dik Tiy will operate and manage the project, while High Road Services Society will provide support services to people living with disabilities. “With the development of this amazing passive housing project, and the hard work of BC Housing, our society and our community, we are excited to see lives changed, blessed, enhanced and improved because of the creation of this community within a community,” said Dana Gorbahn, executive director, Dik Tiy Housing Society. High Road Services Society’s support services will involve working with individuals on a range of self-care and life skills that will assist them in achieving maximum independence.

This is in line with the Province’s goal of going above and beyond the requirements of the BC Building Code in energy-efficiency, moving towards being net-zero energy ready in new construction by 2032. ""The Town of Smithers congratulates BC Housing and the Dik Tiy Housing Society on the completion of their successful project,” said Taylor Bachrach, mayor, Town of Smithers. “Not only does the new building add to the diversity and affordability of housing in Smithers, it also demonstrates climate-action leadership as Smithers' first certified Passive House project. Thank you to BC Housing for this significant investment in our community."" Dik Tiy will operate and manage the project, while High Road Services Society will provide support services to people living with disabilities. “With the development of this amazing passive housing project, and the hard work of BC Housing, our society and our community, we are excited to see lives changed, blessed, enhanced and improved because of the creation of this community within a community,” said Dana Gorbahn, executive director, Dik Tiy Housing Society. High Road Services Society’s support services will involve working with individuals on a range of self-care and life skills that will assist them in achieving maximum independence.

Residents will have access to shared amenities, such as laundry, as well as 24/7 support services, including meal programs and employment and life-skills training. “We know there is a critical need for supportive housing in the Comox Valley. This facility would help people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, access services and support systems in a stable, safe, supervised environment,” said Larry Jangula, mayor of the City of Courtenay. “We look forward to working with BC Housing, local homeless support agencies, and the community, as this process moves forward.” The homes are proposed to be built on city-owned land at 988 - 8th St., which will require an amendment to the current zoning. Pending municipal approvals, construction is anticipated to begin in summer 2018, in order to have the homes ready for the winter. The John Howard Society of North Island has been selected to operate the housing and provide support services for residents. ""The John Howard Society of North Island is thrilled to partner with BC Housing and the City of Courtenay on this greatly needed housing project.

Residents will have access to shared amenities, such as laundry, as well as 24/7 support services, including meal programs and employment and life-skills training. “We know there is a critical need for supportive housing in the Comox Valley. This facility would help people who are homeless, or at risk of homelessness, access services and support systems in a stable, safe, supervised environment,” said Larry Jangula, mayor of the City of Courtenay. “We look forward to working with BC Housing, local homeless support agencies, and the community, as this process moves forward.” The homes are proposed to be built on city-owned land at 988 - 8th St., which will require an amendment to the current zoning. Pending municipal approvals, construction is anticipated to begin in summer 2018, in order to have the homes ready for the winter.

These new projects will help make life more affordable for families in the region by delivering the housing they need and can afford.” Ten new housing projects in the Columbia Basin region will increase the availability of affordable rental homes for individuals, families, seniors or those with disabilities, who are earning a low to moderate income.

These investments will make real, positive impacts on people's lives.” This is one of the many partnerships the Province will be making to deliver on its commitment to build 114,000 affordable homes, including market-rental, non-profit, co-op, owner-purchase and supported social housing to tackle the issue of affordability in British Columbia. “Hundreds of people are going to be able to live better lives, thanks to this partnership between our government and the Columbia Basin Trust,” said Michelle Mungall, MLA for Nelson-Creston. “I’m looking forward to seeing these projects come to fruition, and the benefits that come for people in our region.” The projects will be funded by the Columbia Basin Investment in Affordable Housing agreement, announced in December 2017 between the Province and the Columbia Basin Trust. The Province and the trust will provide $14 million each, over the next three years, to create new affordable rental homes in the region. “We know that housing is essential for healthy and resilient communities,” said Johnny Strilaeff, president and CEO, Columbia Basin Trust. “Our priority is to help ensure residents have access to housing that meets their needs as they vary by community, across the basin.” For a photo, click here:https://flic.kr/p/H5N2vP Learn More:To find out what the Province is doing to improve housing affordability, visit:news.gov.bc.ca/factsheets/bc-government-addressing-housing-affordability-challenges Read Homes for B.C., government’s 30-point plan to address housing affordability for British Columbians:bcbudget.gov.bc.ca/2018/homesbc/2018_Homes_For_BC.pdf For more information about the Columbia Basin Trust’s work to provide more housing to residents, visit:ourtrust.org/housing Contacts:Lindsay ByersMinistry of Municipal Affairs and Housing250 952-0617 Laura MathewsBC Housinglmathews@bchousing.org604-439-8571 Emily GilmarColumbia Basin Trustegilmar@cbt.org1-800-505-8998","ROSSLAND – The Government of British Columbia is working with the Columbia Basin Trust to build 167 new homes for people in the region struggling to find housing they can afford. “People living in the Columbia Basin, like the rest of the province, are feeling the weight of the lack of available, affordable housing,” said Selina Robinson, Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. “Our government recognizes the urgent need to create more options for people struggling to find reasonably priced rental homes.

Two current apartment buildings, located at 3800 and 3802 27 Ave., will remain and receive fire safety upgrades and other improvements.

The Elizabeth Fry Society owns the land and will operate the building. The units will feature private bathrooms. Residents will have access to amenity spaces like a shared kitchen and laundry facilities. Already, there are 27 units on site for women and children, who are at risk of homelessness, which will continue to operate. The second site will be located on city-owned land at 1640 Riverside Rd. and will provide up to 44 modular homes and will include a 40-space shelter operating at the location. The creation of housing on site will allow clients of the shelter, who are able to live more independently, to move to the new supportive housing development. Lookout Housing and Health Society will operate both the modular housing and the shelter. Residents at both sites will have access to 24/7 support services, which includes meal programs, life and employment skills training, and health and wellness support services to help residents overcome challenges to maintaining their housing. BC Housing will provide opportunities for public feedback as required by the municipal approvals process.

Getting this project off the ground is an important first step in addressing homelessness here in Chilliwack.” Residents will be provided meals and have access to life and employment skills training, and get the health and wellness support services to help them overcome challenges to maintaining their housing. Located at 45944 Yale Rd., the proposed supportive housing project will include a medical room and private units with washrooms and kitchenettes for each resident. A rezoning application for the location will be submitted to the city for approval. “Many communities in our province have expressed the need for housing to support vulnerable citizens,” said Sharon Gaetz, mayor, City of Chilliwack. “Chilliwack has worked with BC Housing and we are grateful for the supports that they are offering to us.

We want to help clients engage in treatment, and address their health and social needs,” said Dr. Victoria Lee, Fraser Health vice-president for population health. “Once a person has stable housing, our Intensive Case Management team can work with them and offer a holistic approach to care connecting them to a broad range of services to meet their unique needs, while showing compassion and commitment to their overall well-being.” The ICM team will provide culturally safe and trauma-specific services.

They can’t wait any longer.” The purchased land on Royal Crescent is being proposed as a location for temporary modular homes that will be staffed 24/7. In this case, due to the urgent need and the prolonged tent city situation, the Province has bought the site and intends to move ahead with installing temporary structures. Community members will be consulted on the look of the temporary modular site that could be ready for occupancy before fall 2018. For any future permanent use of the site, BC Housing will seek community feedback to suit the broader housing needs of the community. Permanent use of the site will go through the municipal rezoning process. “As an emergency service worker in Maple Ridge, I can tell you there are serious health and public safety hazards at the camp, and elsewhere in the community, where people are experiencing homelessness,” said Chris McKee, president of the Maple Ridge Firefighters Union. “As firefighters, we treat every patient with dignity and respect, no matter their situation. This is in line with the provincial government’s approach in trying to find effective housing solutions that get people into housing as quickly as possible.” A request for proposals will be issued to invite experienced non-profit organizations to submit their proposals to operate the Royal Crescent site. The operator will provide residents with daily meals, life-skills training and other supports designed to assist residents in meeting their housing goals — including culturally specific programming. “There are well over 100 people in Maple Ridge that would be able to access this housing immediately and fill the place twice over,” said Christian Cowley, executive director of CEED Society. “This is an important part of the housing strategy that the community has been asking for over the past few years.” The Province is working to provide a full spectrum of housing options and supports to help people in need, and to strengthen the overall response to the persistent homelessness and housing challenges in Maple Ridge, including: Another public information session will be held on March 15, 2018.

Located in the heart of the Fairview neighbourhood at 725–799 W. 14th Ave., the redevelopment will replace 86 aging housing units with 230 new rental homes to provide affordable housing for people with a mix of incomes. “For decades, Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation has provided high-quality, affordable rental housing in the region,” said Greg Moore, chair, Metro Vancouver. “Today, our 49 affordable-housing sites serve more than 9,400 residents, and we are constantly improving and expanding our portfolio. Redevelopment projects, like Heather Place, allow us to leverage opportunities to collaborate with member municipalities, the Province and the federal government to provide even more quality, affordable rental housing to the residents of Metro Vancouver.” Phase 1 will include 67 homes of varying sizes, from studios to three-bedroom homes. Thirty of these homes will have rent geared to income with a projected range of approximately $380 to $1,100 per month. The remaining will be low-end market rentals, with rents projected to start at approximately $1,500 per month. ""This new project creates more than 200 urgently needed affordable homes in Fairview for people on low and modest incomes,"" said Gregor Robertson, mayor, City of Vancouver. ""This is the type of housing supply Vancouver needs — rental homes for people who live and work locally. The city is dramatically boosting the right supply of homes for individuals and families who want to put down roots in our city, but we can't do it on our own. I want to recognize Metro Vancouver's major investment in these homes and the Province's leadership in stepping up and committing significant budget dollars to new affordable housing.""

We look forward to the opportunity to support the Province in future initiatives,” Graham said. The first development will be built at 259 Victoria St. West. The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) will provide round-the-clock support to people in these new homes while continuing to operate a separate shelter on the same site. “This addition of supported housing in Kamloops is a critical first step to increasing equality in our community by bringing our neglected, homeless residents indoors where they can recuperate and have consistent access to primary health care, mental-health and addictions Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing City of Kamloops support in a safe and stable environment,”said Christa Mullaly, executive director, CMHA. “The Canadian Mental Health Association, Kamloops branch, is proud to be a partner with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, BC Housing, and the City of Kamloops in the development of these affordable housing projects,” Mullaly said.

Since being selected as one of the Province’s modular builders, this thriving local employer has been working to double the number of skilled employees it has in British Columbia. “It brings me great pride that our company can use our centre of excellence located in Kamloops to play a critical role in this government’s objective of addressing the gap in accommodations for people in need – made-in-British Columbia solution"",said Rod Graham, president and CEO of Horizon North. “I am pleased to say that over the last 12 months, we have significantly increased our headcount in British Columbia – specific positions in all aspects of our business including design, engineering, project management, quality assurance, skilled trades, labourers and truck drivers. We look forward to the opportunity to support the Province in future initiatives,” Graham said. The first development will be built at 259 Victoria St. West. The Canadian Mental Health Association (CMHA) will provide round-the-clock support to people in these new homes while continuing to operate a separate shelter on the same site. “This addition of supported housing in Kamloops is a critical first step to increasing equality in our community by bringing our neglected, homeless residents indoors where they can recuperate and have consistent access to primary health care, mental-health and addictions Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing City of Kamloops support in a safe and stable environment,”said Christa Mullaly, executive director, CMHA. “The Canadian Mental Health Association, Kamloops branch, is proud to be a partner with the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing, BC Housing, and the City of Kamloops in the development of these affordable housing projects,” Mullaly said. The other homes will be located at 317 Tranquille Rd. ASK Wellness Society, a local non-profit organization that provides housing for many people in Kamloops, will provide support to residents. “For almost 15 years, we have worked on the North Shore of Kamloops to provide support services, housing and health-care programs with the hope of helping vulnerable people to reach their potential and to improve the quality of life for all members of the community,” said Bob Hughes, executive director, ASK Wellness Society. “The construction and operation of these housing units with 24-hour wrap-around services will be transformative, not only for the participants living in the building, but will also increase public safety and the liveability for residents and businesses in the area,"" Hughes said. Both locations are expected to provide stable, secure homes for people in need before next winter. The public will be invited to learn more about the new housing at neighbourhood open houses later this month.
