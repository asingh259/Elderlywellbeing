",21-02-2022,I Admit it. I'm Retired and Have Started to Feel Irrelevant,"I recently rescued a dying plant from the clearance rack at my local garden store. It was marked $1, but the nice cashier charged me only 25 cents when he saw the pathetic specimen. And, yes, I dropped another $40 to buy the plant a pot with better drainage, some fresh potting soil, fertilizer and a big bottle of Neem oil.The thing is, Ihadto buy this plant (and all its rescue accoutrements) because I am determined to save it. I want to watch it flourish and bloom, as I’m sure it did once upon a time ago, perhaps when it was just a seedling and the world saw its potential.Why do I have such a burning need to rescue a plant? I think it’s because I am retired and have started to feel irrelevant.I had a high-energy 40-year career as a journalist trying to make a difference, hoping to right wrongs, effect change where I could and hold the rich and famous accountable for whatever they did to those who weren’t just like them. There was no injustice too small for me not to want to fix it. And now? Now there is a vast emptiness where my relevance used to live.For me, it is at the core of what’s wrong with being retired. Sure, I know how to keep busy and I enjoy my midday naps as much as the next retiree. But I would be lying if I didn’t admit that I simply don’t matter as much as I once did. I see how my opinions are given less weight — if they are even sought at all. My contributions make less of an impact. I don’t feel necessary or, on many days, that I even have a purpose.As a journalist, I spent a lifetime hoping to make the world a better place. Today, going to the supermarket is the focal point of my day. See what I mean? Staying relevant, to me, means feeling connected across generations to the news of the world and being in a position to help others in a meaningful way. It means I live my life in a manner that bestows value to it. I want it to matter that I still occupy space on this planet.Doesn’t everyone want that? And if they are retired, how do they get that sense of purpose? So, yes, I still want to be seen, to be counted. And truth be told, I miss feeling current — the kind of hip awareness that can come only from having younger people in your life. Our culture is rapidly changing, and despite being a voracious reader, I feel some days like the world is charging forward without me.I don’t want to be the last person alive to understand why pronouns matter so much or that TikTok tweens and K-pop fans are a clever and growing force to be reckoned with on the world political stage.I am very aware that to some people this essay will sound like a frivolous whine. After all, I’m in good health and am financially comfortable, and many other people my age can’t say the same. But the problem is that when we prepare for our retirement, the bulk of the planning focuses on just those two factors — health and wealth — and very little thought is given to the emotional adjustment required when we step off the playing field and move to the sidelines.I fear that I left my relevance back on the field. I am apparently not alone in this. A Transamerica retirement study in 2017 found that 97 percent of retirees who said they were happy also said they still had a strong sense of purpose. And, in a nutshell, that’s what’s missing from mine.Let’s face it: Only the diehards want to play golf or go fishing every day. Sure, it’s nice to be free of the daily grind and the constant exhausting effort it took to juggle family and work. No, I do not miss the rat race. Volunteering, I’m told, isn’t a bad route to take if it satisfies your itch. Sure, we all could get more involved in our communities: work for elected officials who share our agendas, deliver meals and cheerful banter to shut-ins, join the ranks of those who read to children, walk shelter dogs or clean up the beaches and hiking trails from the slobs who leave it a mess.But some of us are too impatient for any of those things and/or don’t want to be a small cog in the big wheel. (And personally speaking, I have yet to meet a charity-thrift-store volunteer who wasn’t there primarily to get first dibs on the good donated stuff.)Without question, the world still needs improvement — and so do I. My pledge to myself in this new year is to fill the hole in my life that retirement created. Anyone can stay busy, but not everyone can stay relevant. I’m going to stick to writing to make a difference and have dusted off my old book proposal in the hope of finding an agent. And clearly, it’s not a minute too soon: Sadly, the plant has died.","I recently rescued a dying plant from the clearance rack at my local garden store.

",15-09-2020,I’m 71 and I Still Remember Lust,"The last time I went to physical therapy, to try to delay the need for a hip replacement, an attractive 40-something therapist I’ll call Maria worked on me. I had already seen her twice a week for six weeks. That day I was the only client in that time slot, and the other therapists had disappeared, so we were alone. Toward the end of our session, she told me to finish on the weight machine about 25 feet away. After she wiped down the table I had just been on, a model-like 30-something in a body-sculpting workout outfit walked in and lay down on the same table.As I started with the weights, they began talking about a man Maria had met recently. It wasn’t as if I was eavesdropping; I couldn’t help overhearing. At our first appointment she had told me that her husband had died a few years earlier, and on subsequent visits we had talked about mundane things — the difficulty of raising two young children alone, how her mother was helping, and the fun she and her boys had on a recent vacation in Florida. We had never talked about anything like dating; I didn’t want to pry.After a few minutes, the two women’s voices dropped to a whisper, and I realized with a shock that they didn’t want me in on the turn the conversation had taken. There was only one thing they could be discussing; I strongly doubted it was a new recipe for avocado toast. I’m 71 and married, and I can’t remember another incident where younger women had been so rude. What were they thinking? That I might disapprove? That it would be creepy to let someone so much older than them hear the sex talk? Forget me judging them, they were judging me. If I thought they were talking about any other subject I’d dismiss it as general rudeness. But this was uber-rudeness because, of course, it dealt with stereotypes about women’s age and sex lives.I completed the number of reps Maria had assigned me, picked up my sweatshirt and left. I thought of walking over to the table, leaning in and saying, “Just wanted you to know — I remember lust.” I would be hoping it would embarrass them, but I don't know if they would have caught my sarcasm. Instead I let it drop. This was my last appointment.Although the majority of commercials pitching exercise equipment feature sexy young females it is not difficult to find women over 40 who espouse the joys of sex. Joan Price, 76, a member of one of my national writers groups, makes her living by writing about seniors and sex. Her first book on this subject, written at age 61, was Better Than I Ever Expected: Straight Talk About Sex After SixtyHow she pivoted from writing about health and fitness is a story in itself. Joan had met a man at 57, married him at 62 and experienced intense love and passion until he died two years later. She went on to write other books about the joys of sex for both men and women later in life and describes herself on her website as “an advocate for ageless sexuality.”Many older women, like Price, have a long, fulfilling sex life and don’t talk about it. There are women who find sex painful after a certain age, and some whose sex drive drops off a cliff. I’ve talked to both; some seem to be helped by doctors, and some do not. Then there is Jane Fonda and those like her. Two years ago, when she was 80, she told the syndicated TV news magazine Extra that she had “closed up shop down there.”The thing is, we’ve all had different experiences, and we have different needs and desires. No woman should be stereotyped about her sexuality because of her age, especially by younger women.","The last time I went to physical therapy, to try to delay the need for a hip replacement, an attractive 40-something therapist I’ll call Maria worked on me.

",8/7/2020,Be Warned: These Well-Intended Comments Are Actually Ageist,"Sometimes even the best of intentions don’t turn out well. With that in mind, we’d like to eradicate these popularly used phrases that demean older people even when they are meant to be compliments.“You look great!”On the surface, this certainly appears to be a compliment. But scratch below that surface and therein lies the (twofold) problem. Under fold one is whether the speaker had to bite her tongue to stop from adding “for your age.” Many older people hear it even when it’s unspoken. And then there is fold two: Who says “great” anymore? Certainly no self-respecting millennial. “Great” is a second cousin twice removed from “sexy,” “hot” and “amazing.” Thanks, but give us one of those descriptors instead, please.“You don’t look 65!”First, the logic: If I’m 65, then this is what 65 looks like. Makes sense, no?The problem lies in the speaker’s perception — that being young is good and, conversely, being old is bad. So when someone tells you that you don’t look your age, they may see it as complimenting you for defying the aging process. But there are many ways to flatter someone by recognizing her accomplishments — acknowledging that she was born with genes that don’t produce as many wrinkles just isn’t one of them.Plus, not to state the obvious, but every living being grows older every day. And that’s a good thing, considering the alternative. In fact, some things get better with age — and not just fine wine. Studies have shown thatsex improves as you grow older. Chalk it up to practice and experience!“My grandma is so adorable.”Yeah, she’s so darling that you just can’t resist demeaning her, huh? “Adorable” is a term best applied to puppies and babies. When used to describe someone older, it infantilizes the person. It’s time to lose “adorable,” along with “cute,” and maybe stick to language that shows some respect.Ageism occurs when we stop defining people as individuals and view them only in terms of their age. Older people are frequently seen as incompetent, and infantilizing them fuels the idea that they actually are.And while we are breaking bad habits here, maybe quit posting “funny” things like how your mom hasn’t caught on that LOL doesn’t mean lots of love. The notion that older people aren’t internet savvy is bogus and more than a little outdated. They may not have been born with a device in their hand or even been early adapters to a digitally managed life, but most have caught up with technology to some degree. Older people regularly shop and bank online, use social media platforms and rely on their devices for work, entertainment and communications. When you mock their mistakes in public forums, it’s hurtful, not amusing.So before you post your mom’s next goof, just remember, she likely still has that photo of 2-year-old you naked in the bathtub, and she really does know how to attach it to an email.“Can I help you, young lady?”Once again, when you are speaking to a woman who is clearly older, you think this is a compliment. But why reference her age at all? You are reinforcing the cultural value that young is good and old is bad and assuming that calling her a young lady will flatter her. It won’t. Take the woman’s order, ask how you can help, and just do your job. Would you ever in a million years ask a teenager, “Want some freshly grated Parmesan cheese, old woman?” Of course not. So don’t do it here.This may be hard to believe, but there were times in history when elders were actually venerated. They held the most powerful positions in the family and community because of their knowledge and wisdom. The industrial revolution changed much of that, as mobility increased and younger people moved beyond the extended family circle in the pursuit of jobs. As the elders’ roles diminished, so did how older people were regarded in society.So no more “young lady,” please. No more “old-timer,” either. No more “humorous” birthday cards expressing regrets about being a year older. No more “Honey,” “Dear” or “She’s 70 years young.”“Old dogs can't learn new tricks.”This is actually not even true of canines. We all learn new things every day; we just need to be incentivized. Don’t believe me? Just dangle a liver snap in front of my 12-year-old pooch (or a well-paying job in front of an unemployed 65-year-old) and watch what happens.This old-dog-new-tricks comment puts all older folks into the same pot and generalizes that they are not educable or retrainable. It’s an attitude that has caused great financial pain to older workers because it reinforces the false notion that they are incapable of adjusting to the new demands of the workplace.Age has nothing to do with it. Willingness to change and learn is everything. Just ask any of the millions of Americans who areover 65 and still working.As a recentGerontological Society of America reportstated, “Demography is not destiny. The way people and countries respond to an aging society will determine the future.”“60 is the new 30.”I’m not even sure what that means. At 30, I was launching a career; at 60, I was preparing to retire from it.At 30, I stayed up all night; at 60, I go down with the sun and luxuriate at the ability to do so. At 30, I cared what strangers thought; at 60, strangers don’t matter, only my loved ones do.Stop acting like being older is something to be unhappy about.

3,"https://www.aarpethel.com/ageism/its-time-to-stop-using-the-term-senior-citizen
",8/7/2020,It's Time to Stop Using the Term 'Senior Citizen',"On a recent visit to a local big box store, I needed assistance to find an electronics item for my son. The young adult behind the counter wasn't able to help with my request and he told me he'd find a manager to assist me. As I waited and browsed an aisle away, I saw the manager arrive to the service desk. He asked who needed help and I heard the salesman say, “That older lady over there,” while pointing toward me.""That older lady over there” immediately realized I was living in the moment that I knew would come eventually: that moment when society saw me in an older state than I feel. That moment when my outward appearance didn't match my inward feelings of youthfulness.And, like it or not, that moment when you go from a “miss” to a “ma'am” happens to all of us.Sure, the argument can be made that someone is always going to be the oldest in the room and we are all older than someone, but the fact is, these days those who are 50-plus are no longer willing to be identified as “senior citizens.” In fact, most of us would agree that the only time we were excited to be called “senior” was when we were graduating from high school and college. Back then, being a senior meant we ruled the school. Nowadays, “senior citizen” conjures images of nursing homes, walkers and dentures.When I was growing up, I used to dream of spending my retirement years living my best life in Florida with my three best friends, like the characters from “The Golden Girls.” I wanted a lanai and I wanted to speak my mind like Estelle Getty's character, Sophia. But, now that retirement is looming in the not so distant future, I realize that I don't want to be seen “old” or “golden” any time soon. I still want to live in Florida, though.Now that I'm marching toward my 50s and beyond, the word “senior” makes my toes curl. Sure, I want the discounts that come with my age but can't we find a better way to define our generation? Can we all agree that it's time to freshen up the lingo for those over 50? And, the last time I checked, I'm a long way from dentures so you can miss me with the word “aged.""And I'm not alone in my desire to avoid being described as “geriatric” some day.There's a movement across the U.S. to update the language used to identify those in our population who are no longer spring chickens, if you will.Words like “senior citizen, “elderly” and “geriatric” are being kicked to the curb because the over-50 set is demanding to be identified in the way that they actually feel: vibrant and productive. “Old fart,” “codger” and “Q-tip” have largely been abandoned, thank goodness.But, what are the words we should use instead? What should replace terms like “aging communities” and “in their golden years""?Gen Xers and boomers have been so vocal in their revolt againstageist termsthat theAMA Manual of Stylehas corrected the preferred word usage when referring to older people. The manual states that while “elderly” can still be used to describe an issue specific to that population of people, “Terms such as older persons, older people, elderly patients, geriatric patients, older adults, older patients, aging adults, persons 65 years and older, or the older population are preferred.""The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society has changed its lingo, too. In aneditorial post in June 2017, the editors stated, “As a result, despite years of progress in our own understanding of aging, public perceptions are still mired in a ‘swamp’ that treats aging as undesirable. The public associates aging almost exclusively with decline and deterioration.""So, basically, it's the wild Wild West out there and it's up to us to start a revolution. Some are switching to “older people""; others are going with “olders.” Maureen Connors, a retail consultant in San Francisco recentlytold the Boston Globethat she's coined the term “perennials” as a play on “millennials.”When my son was small, I referred to him as “threenager” so I don't see any reason why we can't throw “third-ager” into the mix. However, I'm hoping to live into my “fourth-ager” and “fifth-ager” years, so that might get confusing. For now, I'm going to start telling people that I'm “chronologically superior” and see if that catches on.","On a recent visit to a local big box store, I needed assistance to find an electronics item for my son.

But, now that retirement is looming in the not so distant future, I realize that I don't want to be seen “old” or “golden” any time soon. I still want to live in Florida, though.Now that I'm marching toward my 50s and beyond, the word “senior” makes my toes curl. Sure, I want the discounts that come with my age but can't we find a better way to define our generation? Can we all agree that it's time to freshen up the lingo for those over 50? And, the last time I checked, I'm a long way from dentures so you can miss me with the word “aged.""And I'm not alone in my desire to avoid being described as “geriatric” some day.There's a movement across the U.S. to update the language used to identify those in our population who are no longer spring chickens, if you will.Words like “senior citizen, “elderly” and “geriatric” are being kicked to the curb because the over-50 set is demanding to be identified in the way that they actually feel: vibrant and productive. “Old fart,” “codger” and “Q-tip” have largely been abandoned, thank goodness.But, what are the words we should use instead? What should replace terms like “aging communities” and “in their golden years""?Gen Xers and boomers have been so vocal in their revolt againstageist termsthat theAMA Manual of Stylehas corrected the preferred word usage when referring to older people. The manual states that while “elderly” can still be used to describe an issue specific to that population of people, “Terms such as older persons, older people, elderly patients, geriatric patients, older adults, older patients, aging adults, persons 65 years and older, or the older population are preferred.""The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society has changed its lingo, too. In aneditorial post in June 2017, the editors stated, “As a result, despite years of progress in our own understanding of aging, public perceptions are still mired in a ‘swamp’ that treats aging as undesirable. The public associates aging almost exclusively with decline and deterioration.""So, basically, it's the wild Wild West out there and it's up to us to start a revolution. Some are switching to “older people""; others are going with “olders.” Maureen Connors, a retail consultant in San Francisco recentlytold the Boston Globethat she's coined the term “perennials” as a play on “millennials.”When my son was small, I referred to him as “threenager” so I don't see any reason why we can't throw “third-ager” into the mix. However, I'm hoping to live into my “fourth-ager” and “fifth-ager” years, so that might get confusing. For now, I'm going to start telling people that I'm “chronologically superior” and see if that catches on."

",8/7/2020,Here's the Real Reason Older Women Don't Want to Be Invisible,"I have a special superpower: I am invisible. I am a 69-year-old woman and didn't discover that I had this “gift” until I was in my early 50s.Lots of women know precisely what I'm talking about. As they age, they feel increasingly unseen — marginalized by the younger, the newer, the fresher fruit in the basket. I'd opine that at the core of this phenomenon is an overall broader lack of respect for the elderly except that many older men seem to stay visible pretty much all the way down the Depends aisle. Women? Not so much. And I suspect it's a contributing factor as to why more older women than men live in poverty, which the National Institute on Retirement Security says we do in spades.After all, if we aren't being seen, we aren't being hired, promoted, given raises, or valued.Invisibility hurts, and not just our feelings. When younger people can't see me, they behave as if I no longer have anything worthwhile to contribute to civilization as they know it. Yeah, that part gets old fast. I remember when, at age 59 and newly unemployed, I went on a job interview to be the marketing director for a startup in Santa Monica, California. With my hair freshly coiffed and wearing my best interview suit, I climbed the three flights of steps up to the “office” and knocked on the door. I knew from the minute the door opened that I wasn't who this company wanted. The young woman hiring manager asked me where I saw myself in five years, and I bit my tongue so as not to blurt out “dead with my ashes scattered at sea.” On the way down the three flights of steps, I kicked off the stilettos and knew I would never hear from that company again. All they seemed to see was someone older than their mothers. They appeared blind to my abilities.Invisibility doesn't just mean that as a woman I can now walk past the construction site at the corner and no longer be subjected to catcalls and whistles. (And a pox on the head of any person who ever thought that felt good or took it as a compliment.)No, invisibility cloaks my ability to be validated in meaningful ways. Instead of seeing me for who I am, younger people make broad — and often false — assumptions about my skills, my institutional knowledge and pretty much everything else that I can bring to the table.Remember the highly identifiableepisode ofGrace & Frankiewhen the duo fails to get a sales clerk's attention as they try to buy a pack of cigarettes? Instead of waiting on them, the clerk provides service to a younger woman who waltzed in after them and asks for lottery tickets. Grace's meltdown is replete with the anger and language of the invisible. “Do you not see me???” she beseeches the clerk.Bingo. No Grace, he does not see you, even though you have accomplished more than many as a successful business person, community leader and mother. Your indignation is righteous; your hurt feelings, justifiable. We have all been there. And we applaud Frankie's revenge — pinching the pack of cigarettes because, as previously noted, being invisible does have some upsides.Another upside are my feet, which personally walked their last pair of heels to the trash bin and have been much more pleasant to be around since I became invisible. No one sees the clodhopper sneakers on them or notices that giving up pedicures is a seriously great way to save money.Here's the thing: As long as appearance is the yardstick used to measure a woman's value, older women will get the short end of it. Blame Hollywood for often portraying older women in an unflattering manner; blame our beauty-is-defined-by-youth culture for leaving us out; blame the entire cottage industry that exists because it convinced us that the only way to age gracefully was to actually not age at all. Aging gracefully is just a marketing slogan to sell us products that fuel the hope that we can become visible again. I'm not buying any of it, literally.Here's a crazy idea: Let's flip the script on older people, especially women. Instead of looking for the nearest pasture to send us out to graze with our knitting needles, why not offer us some respect? Instead of pushing us aside, make room for us at the table and hear our thoughts.If, for no other reason, the surest way to make money going forward will be to figure out what boomers are going to need for the next 20 or so years and then produce it. And you need us to tell you what those things are. I would start with “stop treating me like I'm invisible.” A pair of stylish comfortable shoes wouldn't be bad either.","I have a special superpower: I am invisible.

",29-06-2020,Learn the Language of Age Discrimination,"When people think of age discrimination, they usually envision workers fired, denied promotions or never hired simply because of their age.But what if it’s not your livelihood at stake, but more your professional identity and self-worth? What if you are bullied, made miserable or feel threatened by remarks or actions on the job that focus on your age?Liz DiMarco Weinmann can tell you. She was in her 50s, working in Washington, D.C., for a public affairs company when, in a meeting with an important — and younger — client, she briefly forgot the name of a spokesperson. “This man started swearing and cursing at me and saying, ‘I am sick and tired of you not having your young staff here who really knows what’s going on,’ as if I were senile,” she recalls. “He took the papers that were in his hands and threw them at me from across the room.”When Weinmann reported the episode to her manager, the boss compounded the outrage by telling her that if the company lost the account, it’d be because she couldn’t remember things. “It was totally despicable,” she recalls. “That experience was the closest I’ve ever come to thinking to myself that I would just roll up and never work again.”Age harassment, whether it is deliberately or inadvertently hurtful language, is every bit as illegal as other forms of age discrimination. Yet verbal harassment isn’t taken as seriously. And it can be particularly difficult to get justice in the legal system if you are harassed.“If you come home and say, ‘I’ve been accused of calling someone an ‘old fart,’ no one bats an eye,” says Michael Borrelli, an employment attorney with Borrelli & Associates in New York. “Older people are the forgotten group that no one cares about. As far as standing in society, they are totally discounted.”Donna Ballman, an employment attorney in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, agrees. “Older people are getting targeted a lot” by hostile, inappropriate language, she notes.The data supports that. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) said in a recent report that age-based harassment claims more than tripled between 1992 and 2017. A national survey of 3,900 workers by AARP Research in 2018 found that nearly1 person in 4 had heard a boss or a colleague make a negative age-based remark about them.Weinmann, now 67, returned to New York after the incident in Washington and got an advanced business degree. She now owns a consulting practice and advocates for older workers. That includes talking to MBA alumni at New York University about the age harassment they can expect to face as they get older. The language of ageism is “pervasive” in business, she says. “People think that when you get to a certain age, you’re not important.” ADEA and Federal Laws Part of the reason age-biased language is so pervasive is that few employers train workers to view negative age-based remarks as seriously as those that target race, gender or sexual orientation.But more telling are the roadblocks to seeking justice. While federal law says “it is unlawful to harass a person because of his or her age,” that same law limits the damages victims can seek in federal court to things like back pay. In other words, in a federal court case, you can’t be compensated for any mental anguish caused by verbal harassment, and your employer can’t be forced to pay punitive damages, no matter how blatant the abuse. That’s different from federal laws covering discrimination based on race, gender, sex or disability, which allow for compensatory and/or punitive damages.AARP Foundation lawyer Laurie McCann recalls a case in which an older worker’s desk was taken away from him to force him to quit or retire so younger colleagues could be seated. “The older worker who is standing in his office without a desk, what are his monetary damages under federal law? None,” she says. “But he has still suffered harassment.”AARP and other organizations have pushed for a change in the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) to allow for compensatory and punitive damages, McCann says, but “we’re not seeing any progress.”One effective way to win an age-based harassment case at the federal level is to prove that the employer intentionally created a work environment in which the harassment was so severe, hostile and pervasive it would cause a reasonable person to quit, McCann says. In legal terms, that’s called “constructive discharge”; if your case meets this standard, you can sue for lost wages.An example of that is a case filed with the assistance ofAARP Foundation attorneys against Ohio State University. Two instructors, now 64 and 68, in the College of Education and Human Ecology, alleged “an ongoing and unchecked pattern of harassing conduct” by their supervisor, which included calling older workers “millstones” and “deadwood.” That created “working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee in either of their circumstances would have been compelled to resign,” the women said in an EEOC complaint. Eventually, the women’s jobs were eliminated and they were forced to retire. The EEOC found the women had faced “intentional age discrimination” in the workplace. Facing a potentially embarrassing legal battle, the university settled with the women for $765,000 in 2018, gave them their jobs back and committed to conduct training sessions to prevent further bias.Still, such wins are rare. Consider these recent decisions: In the 2013 case William Bennis v. Minnesota Hockey Ventures Group, the then-57-year-old Bennis said he felt he was treated poorly because of his age, citing comments by a supervisor such as, “your eyes get worse as you get older” and being told he didn’t need the job as much as a younger employee. A federal district court ruled Bennis hadn’t shown a hostile workplace.Debra Fletcher, then 58, sued Gulfside Casino in 2011, saying she was harassed by comments such as being asked if she needed a hearing aid or glasses, or used Geritol, and coworkers bringing up the phrase “Seniors Day” around her. A federal district court ruled that the comments were minor and that they were not “of a level serious enough to constitute age harassment.”Charles Denver Baker sued Becton, Dickinson and Co. in 2010, saying he was called too old and slow, was told he lacked energy and enthusiasm, and was informed by a supervisor that he didn’t want anyone over 40 on the sales staff. Baker was 61 when he sued. But he failed to convince a federal court that his workplace environment was hostile. He appealed, but died at age 68. When Robin Shea, an attorney with Constangy, Brooks, Smith and Prophete turned 40, her younger coworkers draped black crepe paper throughout her office and left a cardboard tombstone. She thought it was funny then but now that she’s over age 60, she no longer finds humor in age-related jokes. “Because the threat seems more real,” she says. State Age Discrimination Laws Vary It can be more financially rewarding to pursue an age harassment claim in some states than in federal court. Some states, like Hawaii and Illinois, allow age harassment suits and permit the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages. But state age-bias laws vary widely. South Dakota, for example, has no state age discrimination law at all.Even in states with generous laws against harassing workers, a court battle can be long and costly, and should be viewed as a last resort, experts say. But that doesn’t mean harassment should be tolerated.“I would say anybody who is subject to harassment should, at the very least, talk to their manager — assuming the manager wasn’t the one who was doing it. If they are, go to the HR department,” McCann says. “And if they refuse to address the behavior, the victim should consider filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. It’s wrong and it shouldn’t happen.” Older people are the forgotten group that no one cares about. As far as standing in society, they are totally discounted.MICHAEL BORRELLI, an employment attorney with Borrelli & Associates Employment attorney Ballman advises employees to document the harassing conduct: Note how you’re being treated differently than younger employees, write down any age-related comments, and report the behavior to your human resources department, preferably in writing. Those steps satisfy what a U.S. Supreme Court decision requires: that you report discriminatory harassment and give your employer the chance to remedy it.If the harassment continues, the next step is to consult an attorney and file a complaint with the EEOC and/or with your state’s human relations commission. (Find state human relations commissions atiaohra.org/PublicInformation.) The last resort, if the situation remains unresolved after mediation, is to file a lawsuit against the employer, Ballman says.There are lots of reasons people endure harassment. Some employees may fear retaliation if they complain about a supervisor’s or peer’s conduct. They might be ashamed or have internalized the idea that maybe they are too old, says Brian Heller, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz Perry & Heller.But not reporting age harassment carries its own consequences. “There’s a cost to not coming forward,” Heller says. “You’ve got to live with yourself for not taking action in response to it. That can cause additional scars on the people who suffer harassment.”John Rosengren, author of nine books, has written for more than 100 publications.","When people think of age discrimination, they usually envision workers fired, denied promotions or never hired simply because of their age.But what if it’s not your livelihood at stake, but more your professional identity and self-worth?

That’s different from federal laws covering discrimination based on race, gender, sex or disability, which allow for compensatory and/or punitive damages.AARP Foundation lawyer Laurie McCann recalls a case in which an older worker’s desk was taken away from him to force him to quit or retire so younger colleagues could be seated. “The older worker who is standing in his office without a desk, what are his monetary damages under federal law? None,” she says. “But he has still suffered harassment.”AARP and other organizations have pushed for a change in the federal Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) to allow for compensatory and punitive damages, McCann says, but “we’re not seeing any progress.”One effective way to win an age-based harassment case at the federal level is to prove that the employer intentionally created a work environment in which the harassment was so severe, hostile and pervasive it would cause a reasonable person to quit, McCann says. In legal terms, that’s called “constructive discharge”; if your case meets this standard, you can sue for lost wages.An example of that is a case filed with the assistance ofAARP Foundation attorneys against Ohio State University. Two instructors, now 64 and 68, in the College of Education and Human Ecology, alleged “an ongoing and unchecked pattern of harassing conduct” by their supervisor, which included calling older workers “millstones” and “deadwood.” That created “working conditions so intolerable that a reasonable employee in either of their circumstances would have been compelled to resign,” the women said in an EEOC complaint. Eventually, the women’s jobs were eliminated and they were forced to retire. The EEOC found the women had faced “intentional age discrimination” in the workplace. Facing a potentially embarrassing legal battle, the university settled with the women for $765,000 in 2018, gave them their jobs back and committed to conduct training sessions to prevent further bias.Still, such wins are rare. Consider these recent decisions: In the 2013 case William Bennis v. Minnesota Hockey Ventures Group, the then-57-year-old Bennis said he felt he was treated poorly because of his age, citing comments by a supervisor such as, “your eyes get worse as you get older” and being told he didn’t need the job as much as a younger employee. A federal district court ruled Bennis hadn’t shown a hostile workplace.Debra Fletcher, then 58, sued Gulfside Casino in 2011, saying she was harassed by comments such as being asked if she needed a hearing aid or glasses, or used Geritol, and coworkers bringing up the phrase “Seniors Day” around her. A federal district court ruled that the comments were minor and that they were not “of a level serious enough to constitute age harassment.”Charles Denver Baker sued Becton, Dickinson and Co. in 2010, saying he was called too old and slow, was told he lacked energy and enthusiasm, and was informed by a supervisor that he didn’t want anyone over 40 on the sales staff. Baker was 61 when he sued. But he failed to convince a federal court that his workplace environment was hostile. He appealed, but died at age 68. When Robin Shea, an attorney with Constangy, Brooks, Smith and Prophete turned 40, her younger coworkers draped black crepe paper throughout her office and left a cardboard tombstone. She thought it was funny then but now that she’s over age 60, she no longer finds humor in age-related jokes. “Because the threat seems more real,” she says. State Age Discrimination Laws Vary It can be more financially rewarding to pursue an age harassment claim in some states than in federal court. Some states, like Hawaii and Illinois, allow age harassment suits and permit the awarding of compensatory and punitive damages. But state age-bias laws vary widely. South Dakota, for example, has no state age discrimination law at all.Even in states with generous laws against harassing workers, a court battle can be long and costly, and should be viewed as a last resort, experts say. But that doesn’t mean harassment should be tolerated.“I would say anybody who is subject to harassment should, at the very least, talk to their manager — assuming the manager wasn’t the one who was doing it. If they are, go to the HR department,” McCann says. “And if they refuse to address the behavior, the victim should consider filing a charge of discrimination with the EEOC. It’s wrong and it shouldn’t happen.” Older people are the forgotten group that no one cares about. As far as standing in society, they are totally discounted.MICHAEL BORRELLI, an employment attorney with Borrelli & Associates Employment attorney Ballman advises employees to document the harassing conduct: Note how you’re being treated differently than younger employees, write down any age-related comments, and report the behavior to your human resources department, preferably in writing. Those steps satisfy what a U.S. Supreme Court decision requires: that you report discriminatory harassment and give your employer the chance to remedy it.If the harassment continues, the next step is to consult an attorney and file a complaint with the EEOC and/or with your state’s human relations commission. (Find state human relations commissions atiaohra.org/PublicInformation.) The last resort, if the situation remains unresolved after mediation, is to file a lawsuit against the employer, Ballman says.There are lots of reasons people endure harassment. Some employees may fear retaliation if they complain about a supervisor’s or peer’s conduct. They might be ashamed or have internalized the idea that maybe they are too old, says Brian Heller, a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz Perry & Heller.But not reporting age harassment carries its own consequences. “There’s a cost to not coming forward,” Heller says. “You’ve got to live with yourself for not taking action in response to it. That can cause additional scars on the people who suffer harassment.”John Rosengren, author of nine books, has written for more than 100 publications."

",21-02-2022,3 Things You Should Know About Iron as You Age,"No doubt you remember what you learned about iron in high school science class. It’s an essential mineral, important in making red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout your body. What you may not know is, as we age, our bodies react to it differently. After menopause, women may experience many changes, including unwanted changes in their skin due to shifting iron levels.Fortunately, there are new skincare products that provide a solution, using groundbreaking technology to remove excess iron from skin – with noticeable results.Here are three things you should know about the effects of iron, and changes to expect.Iron plays a big role in bodily functionsIron does a lot of much-needed, heavy lifting for our healthy biological functions. It transports oxygen to our muscles and brain, for starters. Our bodies need adequate levels of iron to make healthy red blood cells.Iron also helps support our immune system, improves concentration, reduces fatigue, and helps regulate body temperature.Things change with menopauseIron excess in a woman’s body is primarily eliminated through menstruation or skin exfoliation. During menopause, this natural removal process ceases. As a result, your body tries to remove more of its excess iron via the skin. There can be as much as 42% more iron in postmenopausal skin than in premenopausal skin1.Secondly, during menopausal transition, skin becomes thinner, drier, and more wrinkled. This is due to changes in collagen and elastin content, as well as the skin’s inability to exfoliate efficiently on a daily basis. As that process declines, iron builds up in the skin.Too much iron puts stress on our skinIron overload isn’t one of the menopause symptoms you’ve likely heard about. There are other much more obvious physiological changes you cannot ignore than iron accumulating in your skin (hello, hot flashes!). However, when this increased iron is exposed to UV radiation, blue light, air pollutants, and irritants from other sources, it accelerates the production of free radicals that cause oxidative stress. Your skin can show the signs of oxidative stress through dullness, dinginess, dark spots, and discoloration. That’s why we often wake up at 50 and wonder why our skin has aged seemingly suddenly.There is a solution. A new product on the market disrupts the root cause of aging skin before it starts – i-On® Age Disrupting Skincare with patented DII® Technology. It safely removes excess iron from the skin, and actually prevents iron-induced free radicals from ever forming in the first place, inhibiting skin damage and aging. It also helps rebuild the skin’s healthy and youthful appearance with niacinamide, portulaca oleracea extract, and squalane.The founder of i-On® Age Disrupting Skincare with DII® Technology, Dr. Xi Huang, is an expert on iron and health.“i-On leaves you with healthier, more beautiful looking skin,” says Dr. Huang. “These products are clinically proven to deliver significant differences in the appearance of wrinkles, discoloration, dryness, dark circles under eyes and vibrancy of skin. It plumps the skin and hydrates it more rapidly, effectively disrupting and defying the aging process.”The newest products in the i-On product line are i-On Age Disrupting Skin Cream, i-On Age Disrupting Total Eye Performance Eye Cream, and the Gentle Deep Pore Cleanser.

",25-01-2021,Making the Case for Aging Disgracefully,"My favorite aunt lived well into her 90s, and when I say she “lived well,” I am not suggesting that the mere act of reaching her advanced age should be viewed as any sort of accomplishment. Quite the contrary. She lived well because as she crept up in years, she simply chose to do whatever the hell she wanted, when she wanted and with whomever she wanted.She adopted a devil-be-damned attitude and would be quick to say she didn’t give a “flying fig” what anyone else had to say about her choices. I use “flying fig” as a direct quote because my late aunt rarely cursed. Profanity, she believed, was the provenance of those with small vocabularies and even smaller minds. The two things I remember most about her were that she had an intellectual curiosity that knew no boundaries and an unrepentant lust for much younger men. The latter made me blush on more than one occasion, which generally earned me a “I don’t give a flying fig” reminder.Truth is, right up until her death some 15 years ago, she was drawn to smart people and loved being in love — for however long it lasted. Some of her romances lasted through lunch, but she cherished them all. And to her credit, she had a fairly constant stream of suitors who were, on average, around 20 years her junior. Some of them eventually became one of her husbands or live-in partners. But she invariably grew bored with all of them. That said, she had the gift of letting men down gently. Friendship wasn’t a consolation prize for a failed romance, she believed. And as such, she created a small army of male friends that she could call upon in a pickle. A “pickle” was her word for things like needing someone to drive her places at night after I demanded she move out from behind the wheel — at least on freeways.Many older women today will undoubtedly want to know: Where exactly did my 90-plus-year-old aunt find all these men worth spending time with? Well, for one, she moved around like a hummingbird in a constant state of flirtation. She flirted with men of all ages wherever she went — the supermarket, where she invariably asked for help “reaching” something; the Scrabble club, where she coquettishly admired many a man’s two-letter word list; and even the hospital (a place that she, as a rule, avoided like the plague), where she assured more than one young doctor that his blue scrubs really brought out his blue eyes. As the doctor blushed, she would tell him that eyes were the window to the soul and then locked hers onto his.What can I say? She was a player right up until she died. I remain convinced she emitted a pheromone that made her irresistible. While I admired my aunt through all the stages of her life, her deepest imprint on me came as I watched her face aging. She rejected any sort of pressure to “age gracefully” and even joked that she much preferred to “age disgracefully.”From her throaty laugh and raunchy jokes delivered with a faux innocence, she was a sassy broad with little tolerance or time for fools. “When you are my age,” she often said, “time is a commodity to be spent wisely.”By design, she actively avoided spending a lot of time in the company of people who complained, especially if it was about what ailed them. Body parts don’t come with a lifetime warranty, she believed, adding that it was incumbent on everyone to take care of their own parts instead of rushing to doctors with each new ache. She took vitamins but little else, ate nothing with a face and walked 3 miles a day except on the days she’d head out at night to go dancing. And as for going to see doctors, let’s just say she operated with the philosophy that bad news always finds you, so there was no need to go out and look for it.My aunt never fretted a moment over the changes her body — all bodies — would undergo as she got older. She scoffed at anything labeled “anti-aging” and enjoyed tormenting department store saleswomen who peddled such products. “Do you realize what the alternative is to not aging?” she would beseech them. “It’s death!”For the record, my aunt didn’t fear dying, but she made it clear she wasn’t especially keen on having a painful or prolonged death conjured up for her in the name of medical interventions. Now, as I enter my 70s, I’ve been thinking a lot about my aunt — far beyond hoping that I’ve been blessed with her longevity genes. I’ve been giving a lot of thought to how I want to spend the next 25 years or so.

Visit the AARP Resume Advisor atwww.aarp.org/resume.Have you updated your resume recently?Does even the word resume send your blood pressure soaring? Does it fill your mind with anxious thoughts of bond paper in the appropriate weight, sleek font choices and formatting, and the right keywords that convey professionalism? Now add to your panic the stark realization that looking for a job after age 50 brings with it an entirely new set of resume worries that you probably haven't even thought of. I bet the last work history you created for yourself contained your home address, home phone number, the year you graduated from college and, dare I say, an AOL email address.What was considered cutting edge in resume two decades ago is not even recognizable now. And because age discrimination is still very much a barrier to seeking full-time employment after middle age, it's more important than ever that your resume doesn't focus on your age. Rather, it should reflect life experience (and, of course, relatable work skills).Mark Miller is the founder ofCareerPivot.com, a career website focusing on the second half of life. He also hosts the popular Repurpose Your Career podcast, which features interviews with a variety of career counseling experts as well as regular folks who have made huge career pivots in midlife or after, and who want to share the wisdom and lessons they learned throughout the job-seeking process. Miller contends that people over 50 seeking new employment for the first time in a decade or more need to completely rewrite their old-school resume to age-proof it. On his site he offers several tips on this, as well as guidance on how to navigate new job-seeking outlets such as social media, and the ins and outs of self-promotional methods like personal branding.He also urges those over 50 who may not be familiar with using these new types of job-seeking technologies to become not only very familiar with them, but ultimately very tech savvy and adept at using them. This is yet another way to not show your age, so to speak. In other words, when someone asks to connect on LinkedIn and you reply with “What's that?,” you've already aged yourself considerably.""The over-50 crowd is not used to self-promotion, but they need to start getting as good at it as their younger counterparts,” Miller says. “They should be using all forms of social media channels to self-promote their work, even YouTube. The biggest mistake they can make is doing nothing, because when someone Googles your name, if nothing comes up, you're in trouble.”The first thing Miller espouses is that, by age 50, your job searching should really begin within your already well-established employment and associate network, and though it's still needed, this puts less reliance on an actual resume which is a good thing. He also encourages job seekers over 50 to be open to engaging with a new network of workers, ideally those younger than themselves. Millennial workers are neither to be feared nor to be ignored, as a mutual and respectful working and social relationship between your generation and theirs can be hugely beneficial. As some of your over-50 working peer group begins to age out of the workforce, that's exactly when (and why) it becomes imperative to embrace the younger set. And yes, one of them actually could be your next boss.Some additional resume and personal branding tips:1. Personal contact informationshould not include your home address or home telephone number, only a mobile number. Use a Gmail address (not AOL or Earthlink or some other older provider), or even better, get your own domain email, e.g., john@johnsmith.com. If you use any social media professionally by sharing your work content or trends in your industry on it, provide those channels, like your Twitter and Instagram handles. But leave off the personal Facebook accounts, which should be heavily locked down. Check your privacy settings.2. If you feel the need to list any skillsthat would be pertinent to the job you're seeking, make sure they're relevant to thenow. No need to inform prospective employers that you're proficient in MS-DOS or another antiquated and no longer used platform or programming language. Stick to the current only. As far as job history, Miller suggests going back no further than 15 years. No need to list your first job out of college. He also recommends you state previous employment goals reached in a way to “show me what you've done, don't tell me.” See No. 4 on how to do this. In general, eliminate older dates and limit your resume to two pages or less.3. Getting on LinkedIn is a must.It's imperative tomovein the same rooms themoversare in, and they're moving in there.

There they go, buh-bye, all sun-kissed and wonderfully moisturized, flaunting a sassy pedicure. Perpetually covered, they will not see the light of day all winter. Let’s be honest, when spring comes my feet are not ready for public consumption. Oh no, they are pasty white and wrinkly from being cooped up in winter boots. You’ve heard — if not seen — what a broken arm looks like after it’s healed and emancipated from its plaster cast, right? Pale. Yep. Wrinkly. Yep. A bit unsightly. Yep.Toenails hastily clipped during winter so they don’t blow a hole through socks have clearly been neglected. For goodness’ sake, there’s the telltale sock fuzz stubbornly embedded around the nail. And my heels? Reddened and protruding, looking freakishly disfigured, because, sigh, there was that new pair of Michael Kors suede boots that took most of last winter to break in. I went through boxes of Band-Aids and felt triumphant when I could finally wear the boots without anyheel pain! But damn, I looked good. The pain was worth it, I thought, until I evaluated the damage as I returned to summer wear: corns, calluses, Haglund’s deformity and heel spurs. Lots to wrap your mind around, how well I know.Here are eight ways to practice kindness on your feet this winter. Pedicures.Keep them coming through the winter. Why stop the TLC? Give your feet the professional attention they deserve, because after all, they need all the help they can get! In between those indulgent pedicures, there are many ways you’ll want to shower kindness on your feet, such as …Epsom salts bath soaks.They benefit the whole body, feet included. Add several drops of your favorite essential oil to boost your soak, and relish the “work” of taking care of your feet. Or, try the Epsom Salt Tea-Tree Oil Foot Soak, mixed with your needy feet in mind.Pumice stone.It’s the humble go-to: affordable and easy to find. The varieties are endless, from the natural lava-infused to the general two-sided variety you can find at the grocery store. Give yourstone a warm soakbefore setting about the grim business, because dry stones are a big no-no.Ped Egg.Who hasn’t heard of it?! For those needing — ahem — more (you know who you are), try this popular little tool that offers three different ways to address calluses and corns, leaving feet smooth and shiny. Caution: Always use on dry feet.Toenails.Buffingyour toenails — like you would fingernails — helps keep the surface smooth and increase circulation. Toenails knock up against the tops of your shoes all winter and will benefit from a light sanding. Gently push back cuticles. If cuticles are overly dry during winter, try a dab of olive oil or vitamin E oil.Socks.You read labels all the time, why stop when you’re selecting what to clothe your feet in all winter long? The cardinal rule: Avoid cotton socks. They. Don’t. Breathe. They create the perfect sweaty environment for fungus to grow (yuck), adding to your misery. Athlete’s foot is so yesterday, my friend. Instead, try winter socks made withmerino wool, which provides wicking action and warmth.Moisturizing.Keep feet silky and healthy by faithfully moisturizing through the winter. Shake up your routine by adding coconut oil to your assembly of options. Consider moisturizing before bed and throwing on some therapeutic aloe socksto lock in moisture overnight.C’mon!Be smart when you buy.Don’t be deceived — being kind to your feet and fashionable are not mutually exclusive ambitions. The marketplace has many great labels built to love on your feet and make you look like a boss when you float down the sidewalk.

",31-08-2020,Why We Pass More Gas as We Age,"You're aging so gracefully until a not-so-pleasant scent sneaks up and out from behind.Yes, we're gonna go there. This is a story all about why you may be farting more often as you age, aka why you've become an old fart — and what you can do about it.First, we'll set the record straight. There's limited data actually showing that you toot more as you age.The only real study looking at at this was done in 2017. It was self-reported (how often do you toot daily?) and found that older adults don't necessarily pass gas (or admit to it) more frequently than younger adults.But some do, and there are real reasons for this. Healthy adults pass gas between 10 and 25 times per day. As you get older, however, you're more likely to take medications, gain weight, become lactose intolerant and have other issues that lead to an increase in gas.So, it's not necessarily the age that's leading to the tooting — it's all the other stuff.The actual age at which these changes occur is variable, in part due to the difference in our medical conditions,medicationsand genetic makeup, says Jesse Houghton, senior medical director of gastroenterology with SOMC Gastroenterology Associates in Portsmouth, Ohio.If you think you're farting more often than you were when you were younger, then read on to determine the cause.Increased weight gainAmericans tend to gain weight as we age, says Houghton says. This is due to several factors, including decreased metabolism, increased medications that cause weight gain and decreased exercise. “While this can be associated with increased flatulence, it is commonly associated with increased acid reflux and belching,” Houghton says.MedicationWhether it's medication for high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes or heart disease medications, our medication lists seem to grow as we age, Houghton says. “These medications also tend to cause constipation, which often results in retention of gas, and subsequently increased bloating,” he says. Common prescription medications also tend to cause weight gain, which can worsen GERD, or gastroesophageal reflux disease.Lactose intoleranceA common cause of bloating and flatulence is dairy products, and lactose intolerance increases as we age. This is because we have less of the lactase enzyme that helps us digest the carbohydrate lactose, Houghton says.The anal sphincter weakensThis is simply a result of aging, resulting in less ability to hold in flatulence when we need to. “This is especially true in older women who have had multiple vaginal deliveries,” Houghton says.Stop the flatulence:This really depends on what's causing it, Houghton says. For example, if you've developed a sensitivity to lactose, you can avoid dairy by substituting oat milk for regular milk — or you can take lactase replacement enzymes before meals that contain dairy.If you have a weakened anal sphincter, you can do Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles (some of these supply the anal sphincter).Avoiding foods that tend to cause gas (broccoli, dairy, beans, brussels sprouts, cabbage and onions) can also help with this, Houghton says.Avoiding lying in a supine position for at least two hours after eating can also help, says Priyanka Chugh, assistant professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and hepatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. In conjunction with this, Chugh says, eat your food slowly, chew it carefully, avoid gulping water and skip the bubbly drinks altogether.Lastly, over-the-counter products such as simethicone (Gas X, Phazyme) and Beano (alpha Galactosidase) can help with excess bloating and gassiness caused by our diets.","You're aging so gracefully until a not-so-pleasant scent sneaks up and out from behind.Yes, we're gonna go there.

",10/7/2020,The Truth About Your Eyes as You Age,"When I was 25, I got laser eye surgery, tossed out my glasses and had a celebration for my permanent perfect vision.I wasn't looking ahead (pun intended) to my 40s, 50s and 60s when, like most people, I'd find myself back at the optometrist with a brand new prescription. Turns out, there's little we can do to stop our eyes from aging — but there are some proactive steps we can take to prevent serious damage and to prepare our eyes for the future.""All parts ofeyes undergo changes as we age, and those changes all have an impact on our vision quality,” says Jin Gao, an optometrist at Philadelphia-based Eye Love Eyewear. “However, the rate of change can be different for each person, depending on each person's family history, lifestyle, occupation, diet and more.""But for starters, expect to have to pop on a super-trendy pair of reading glasses around the age of 40. It only gets more fun from there.Your eyes in your 50sPresbyopia, or the difficulty to focus on objects up close, typically hits in your early 40s and continues to advance through your 50s and beyond, says Ryan Parker, an optometrist and director of professional education at lens manufacturer Essilor in Dallas. That's because as you age, your natural defense mechanisms begin to decline. Based on your genetics and diet, this may be a good time toincrease vitamin supplements for your eyes.As you get closer to your 60s, the risk of more eye diseases increases, such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment. Preventive measures include eating a diet filled with dark leafy greens, wearing UV-blocking sunglasses and reducing smoking, Gao says.If you're spending a significant amount of time in front of the computer screen, you should invest in blue-light lenses, which can help combat the negative effects of screen time leading to retinal damage, says Toni Albrecht, an optometrist at InVision Optical in Minneapolis.Women who are going through menopause or are postmenopause may also experience dry eyes at this time. Keeping your eyes lubricated with eye drops is important.Your eyes in your 60sAs you cross into your 60s, the risk for many ocular diseases continues to increase. “This decade is the first time that many people experience the first signs of a cataract, a gradual clouding of the intraocular lens,” Parker says. “People may notice trouble driving at night, needing more light to see and difficulty with color perception.""If you have a strong family history of eye diseases such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment — or if you're diabetic — you should start having annual dilated eye exams, Gao says.Postwork headaches become more common because as you age, eye fatigue occurs, and your accommodation system in the back of your eyes weakens over time. It becomes more difficult for your lens to change shape and give adequate power, and the muscle in the back of your eye has to work harder, Gao says. Cue the reading glasses or progressive lenses!Your eyes post-70After the age of 70, almost all patients will have advancing cataracts and may need to have cataract surgery, Parker says. Plus, the risk for vision-threatening ocular conditions continues to increase. Yearly comprehensive eye exams are essential in dealing with these conditions, as many ocular diseases can be managed more effectively and treated if identified early.","When I was 25, I got laser eye surgery, tossed out my glasses and had a celebration for my permanent perfect vision.I wasn't looking ahead (pun intended) to my 40s, 50s and 60s when, like most people, I'd find myself back at the optometrist with a brand new prescription.

",20-09-2021,What it's Like to Still Be Single at Age 66,"A holiday that speaks directly to me is National Singles Day, on Sept. 22. At 66, without an ex-husband, or even a deceased one to memorialize, I've flown through life solo. With two brothers and their combined five marriages, resulting in 19 offspring, I often envied their lives.When my big brother—who owned a law firm, a big house, fancy cars—told me three months before his passing that he was jealous of me, I was shocked when he replied, ""Because you've lived life as a free spirit."" I was shocked. Has my life as a “one” been as much fun as my brother believes it has been? Yes and no.When my father passed away in 2006, after 63 years of marriage to my mom, I noticed that my still glamorous and social mother was not dating and didn’t seem to have any interest.“Mom, you’re so vibrant. Don’t you want to meet a man?”“They’re all looking for a nurse with a purse,” she replied. “This is the first time in my life that I don’t have to answer to anyone.”She married my father when she was 18. So, what is life like when you don’t have a partner, lover or spouse and there is no need to compromise? You can watch what you want on TV, eat when and what you want, and travel anywhere you want to go. The single life has allowed me to engage with many fascinating people and have varied, exotic experiences.However, now that I am closer to 70 than 60, I’m thinking,Who is going to be there when I can no longer take care of myself?My intimate relationships, a few of which pried opened my heart, did bring me joy I never felt when being alone. Randy, my live-in boyfriend, loved me like no other. When I returned home each night, I’d find yellow stickies filled with love notes. I’d wake up seeing him staring at me. My sleepy eyes focused on his handsome face, and I heard him whisper, “You’re so beautiful!” That was over 25 years ago, before gravity kicked in and my skin lost some elasticity.Eric was 12 years younger. We traveled the back roads together and laughed nonstop.“How could you not fall in love with him with his bedroom blue eyes?” my dad asked. Eric was also an amateur photographer, and I was his favorite subject. Although I was self-conscious of our age difference—“Just call me Mrs. Robinson,” I often told him—no one else seemed to notice.Again, this was a couple of decades before my eyes became hooded and my neck turned crepey. Most recently, Walter managed to captivate me. A Harvard graduate, he would gloat to his family and friends about my achievements, with this: “You have to watch her films. She even won an Emmy.” His attention to my work and constant encouragement filled a huge void.Although he had a face- and neck-lift, followed by regular injections of Botox and fillers, he wasn’t pushing me to do the same. It was his obsession with straight-haired blondes that drove me to smooth my curly brunette mane. But, finally, his addiction to porn and those other women ended our relationship.Alone again, back on the dating apps, more jaded than before, I search with skepticism, weeding out the con artists and scammers and looking for someone with whom I can at least enjoy a face-to-face one-hour conversation.As I now find myself,  one year later, temporarily living with my formidable 98-year-old mother, I don’t see an exit. We are two forces under one roof,  and she keeps reminding me it’s her roof. Some days I am so overwhelmed, I gasp for air in her presence 24/7.Compromised by a recent broken shoulder, as a result of her missing a step, she was not able to receive physical therapy due to COVID-19. My once-fearless mother now shuffles when she walks, prefers her bed to the recumbent bike and huffs leaning forward to tie her shoelaces.How could I leave her now?Social psychologist Bella DePaulo, author ofSingled Out: How Singles Are Stereotyped, Stigmatized and Ignored,and Still Live Happily Ever After,writes, “When aging parents need help, they are more likely to get it from their grown children who are single than those who are married.”Since my father died 15 years ago, I have been Johnny-on-the-spot for my mom. When she informed her children that she was having prolapsed-bladder surgery seven years ago, my brothers and I jumped on a call to determine how we would share her care.One brother offered to fly down for only the day of the surgery, and the other, who lives just a three-hour drive away, said he would come for one weekend. Guess who was there from the beginning for several weeks until she was healed? You got it. Moi!Still, some studies have found that despite their added family responsibilities, older singles are not compromised in levels of happiness.Researchers from Michigan State University examined the relationships of 7,532 people, followed from ages 18 to 60, to determine who was the happiest at the end of their lives. The July 2020 report, published in theJournal of Positive Psychology,determined that lifelong singles and those who had varied relationship histories didn’t differ in how happy they were at the end of their lives.“What too many people don’t realize is that for some people, being single is how they live their best, most authentic, most meaningful, and most fulfilling life,” writes DePaulo, who calls these people “single at heart.”She also notes that people who have always been single tend to exercise more, given their more overall “me time.”Perhaps one day I will find my soul mate. And if not, I would rather weather the solitary life and still have my freedom. I do know firsthand that being in a bad relationship can be lonelier than being alone.","A holiday that speaks directly to me is National Singles Day, on Sept. 22.

",22-11-2021,10 Tips for Happy Aging From a Feisty 80-Something,"My mom and dad both died in their early 70s, so when I turned 80 two years ago, that was older than I ever expected to be.Since my parents were not role models for a vital old age, I had to figure it out for myself. I think I’ve done a pretty good job, since this has turned out to be the busiest, happiest and most successful period of my life!Here are my tips for aging well, with a smile and finesse. Don’t socialize exclusively with seniors. When I’m around people of my advanced age, I feel my advanced age. When I hang out with my younger friends, I forget my advanced age. For one thing, they keep me up-to-date on the latest trends. This is important, since I rarely recognize the name of this week’s musical guest onSaturday Night Live.

Don’t socialize exclusively with seniors. When I’m around people of my advanced age, I feel my advanced age. When I hang out with my younger friends, I forget my advanced age.

",8/7/2020,How to Age-Proof Your Resume,"In January 2019, AARP launched a new resume advice and professional writing service tailored to help older workers who are looking for new jobs or switching positions. Visit the AARP Resume Advisor atwww.aarp.org/resume.Have you updated your resume recently?Does even the word resume send your blood pressure soaring? Does it fill your mind with anxious thoughts of bond paper in the appropriate weight, sleek font choices and formatting, and the right keywords that convey professionalism? Now add to your panic the stark realization that looking for a job after age 50 brings with it an entirely new set of resume worries that you probably haven't even thought of. I bet the last work history you created for yourself contained your home address, home phone number, the year you graduated from college and, dare I say, an AOL email address.What was considered cutting edge in resume two decades ago is not even recognizable now. And because age discrimination is still very much a barrier to seeking full-time employment after middle age, it's more important than ever that your resume doesn't focus on your age. Rather, it should reflect life experience (and, of course, relatable work skills).Mark Miller is the founder ofCareerPivot.com, a career website focusing on the second half of life. He also hosts the popular Repurpose Your Career podcast, which features interviews with a variety of career counseling experts as well as regular folks who have made huge career pivots in midlife or after, and who want to share the wisdom and lessons they learned throughout the job-seeking process. Miller contends that people over 50 seeking new employment for the first time in a decade or more need to completely rewrite their old-school resume to age-proof it. On his site he offers several tips on this, as well as guidance on how to navigate new job-seeking outlets such as social media, and the ins and outs of self-promotional methods like personal branding.He also urges those over 50 who may not be familiar with using these new types of job-seeking technologies to become not only very familiar with them, but ultimately very tech savvy and adept at using them. This is yet another way to not show your age, so to speak. In other words, when someone asks to connect on LinkedIn and you reply with “What's that?,” you've already aged yourself considerably.""The over-50 crowd is not used to self-promotion, but they need to start getting as good at it as their younger counterparts,” Miller says. “They should be using all forms of social media channels to self-promote their work, even YouTube. The biggest mistake they can make is doing nothing, because when someone Googles your name, if nothing comes up, you're in trouble.”The first thing Miller espouses is that, by age 50, your job searching should really begin within your already well-established employment and associate network, and though it's still needed, this puts less reliance on an actual resume which is a good thing. He also encourages job seekers over 50 to be open to engaging with a new network of workers, ideally those younger than themselves. Millennial workers are neither to be feared nor to be ignored, as a mutual and respectful working and social relationship between your generation and theirs can be hugely beneficial. As some of your over-50 working peer group begins to age out of the workforce, that's exactly when (and why) it becomes imperative to embrace the younger set. And yes, one of them actually could be your next boss.Some additional resume and personal branding tips:1. Personal contact informationshould not include your home address or home telephone number, only a mobile number. Use a Gmail address (not AOL or Earthlink or some other older provider), or even better, get your own domain email, e.g., john@johnsmith.com. If you use any social media professionally by sharing your work content or trends in your industry on it, provide those channels, like your Twitter and Instagram handles. But leave off the personal Facebook accounts, which should be heavily locked down. Check your privacy settings.2. If you feel the need to list any skillsthat would be pertinent to the job you're seeking, make sure they're relevant to thenow. No need to inform prospective employers that you're proficient in MS-DOS or another antiquated and no longer used platform or programming language. Stick to the current only. As far as job history, Miller suggests going back no further than 15 years. No need to list your first job out of college. He also recommends you state previous employment goals reached in a way to “show me what you've done, don't tell me.” See No. 4 on how to do this. In general, eliminate older dates and limit your resume to two pages or less.3. Getting on LinkedIn is a must.It's imperative tomovein the same rooms themoversare in, and they're moving in there. Water that account daily as if it's a plant that you definitely need to keep alive, so that it will eventually bloom for you.4. Becoming a personal brandis no longer seen as obnoxious. Rather, it's seen as obvious. Talking about your career outside of the office and on social media, even creating a YouTube channel and uploading yourself speaking about trends in your industry, unofficially makes you an expert. Also, starting your own blog and writing and sharing industry trends on there also makes you an expert in the making. How? When future employers Google your name, those platforms, blog entries and videos will appear in their search results, and suddenly you've moved to the top of their prospect list. It's the best way to show what you've done, in a way that a paper resume just can't do. As a matter of fact, your resume should be accessible on yourownwebsite. Never thought of buying the domain of your name?

",8/7/2020,How to Start Running — Whatever Your Age,"I love to run.But that wasn't always the case.Shortly before turning 50, I went through menopause and was experiencing what I now call the “umpies” — frumpy, lumpy and oh-so-very grumpy — and knew I had to do something to get my health,weightand life back on track.Around this time, feeling at my absolute lowest, my family and I watched runners of all shapes, sizes, fitness levels and ages compete in the New York City Marathon. I wondered how anyone could run at all, let alone run 26.2 miles. At that moment, my youngest daughter blurted out, “I want to hold up a sign that says “Go, mom, go!” Everyone looked at me, waiting for my response. “Okay,” I said.And that's how I started running.Running was not something I ever did willingly (except when chasing down the Mr. Softee ice cream truck as a kid in Brooklyn). Worse, I hadn't done any kind of sustained exercise since the Jane Fonda ‘feel the burn’ CDs era, and it showed.Lucky for me, I came across a life-changing article in theWall Street Journalabout Jeff Galloway, the Olympian and marathoner who developed the Galloway Run-Walk-Run program used by hundreds of thousands of people around the world to not only run, but train for marathons.I had just started researching and writing my first book about healthy aging, so I contacted Galloway to interview him about the program, secretly hoping he might talk me out of trying to run the NYC Marathon. Instead, he insisted that anyone who could walk could run, regardless of age or fitness level, just by following his simple method. Willing to try, I made a commitment that day and bought my first pair of running shoes (and a very cool outfit to go with them) and signed up to run in the following year's NYC Marathon.Like many people in midlife, I was worried because I thought that running could hurt my joints. Research shows, however, that it won't, if done correctly. After 30 years of following his own program, Galloway has never had an injury. The reason is simple: It calls for gentle running (no pounding!) with scheduled walk breaks. Distance, not speed, is the goal. This way of running is easy on the joints, yet gives ahigh performance cardio workout, and helps build muscle mass and bone density in our legs and hips, which is crucial in the battle against osteoporosis.As we get older, we lose muscle strength, flexibility,sense of balance, and our bones start to thin. This is especially true for women because estrogen levels drop as we go through menopause, causing bones to weaken. In fact, women can lose up to 20 percent of their bone density five to seven years after menopause, unless we actively do something about it, like running.I took the plunge and committed myself to a regular schedule of running, knowing I had one year to get ready to run 26.2 miles. It wasn't always easy to lace up and get out the door. There were many early mornings when I wanted to hit the snooze button. But, I had made a promise to myself and to my daughters that I would run in the next NYC Marathon, which ended up being one of the best gifts I've ever given myself. Running became the foundation of my plan to age successfully and helped me lose weight, get fit, sleep better and feel happier.If you're thinking about starting a running program, do these things first: Get the green light from your doctor . . . just to be sure.See a podiatrist to make sure you don't have any issues with your feet.Visit a running shoe store to get a new pair of running shoes, and break them in by walking before you start running.Start slowly and build up.Find the run/walk ratio that's right for you (mine is 60 seconds of running/20 seconds of fast walking). I ran my first marathon on schedule and never felt more powerful than I did that day, especially when I saw my daughters cheering me on along the course. I am now a regular runner, but also a regular marathoner. In fact, I'm training to run my 7th NYC Marathon in a few months, shortly before turning 63. As I like to say, if I can do it, anyone can.","I love to run.But that wasn't always the case.Shortly before turning 50, I went through menopause and was experiencing what I now call the “umpies” — frumpy, lumpy and oh-so-very grumpy — and knew I had to do something to get my health,weightand life back on track.Around this time, feeling at my absolute lowest, my family and I watched runners of all shapes, sizes, fitness levels and ages compete in the New York City Marathon.

17,"https://www.aarpethel.com/lifestyle/bra-shopping
",29-06-2020,How the Bra Chooses the Woman as You Age,"A bra that fits … that's what I'd been really looking forward to.The shop was chrome and glass. Silver cursive letters over the door read Oleanders: Purveyors of Fine Lingerie Since Day One. A single brassiere lay on a red satin pillow in the shop's window.As I opened the door, a hidden chime sounded the first five notes of Wagner'sRide of the Valkyries. The showroom's couches were fluffed to pillowy clouds. Along each wall, rows of metal railings holding hundreds of hangers dangled bras in a dazzling array of reds, blacks and creams, the canary yellows exotic birds among domestics. The entire room crackled with a secret magic.""Greetings,” said a rasping voice. I jumped. A tiny woman with leathery skin stood beside me, azure contacts gathering and reflecting the room's light.""Hello,” I said, swallowing.""Griselda Oleander,” she said with a slight bow. “I've been expecting you. All Women of a Certain Age find their bodies rapidly shifting. Elasticity fades. For the bosom, gravity is a harsh mistress.""I nodded a bow in return, then glanced down at my upper deck. Once perky in its own right, middle age after breastfeeding three children had indeed taken its toll. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.""Can you help?” I lowered my chin to peer into her eyes. “Can you find one that fits?""""Hmmm.” She stared deeply into my chest. “That is not up to me. The bra, you see, chooses the woman. Follow me.” Her emerald skirt swished around her ankles as she led me to the back of the shop. The rear wall comprised three stalls, each six feet across. Instead of doors, heavy velvet curtains trailed from brass rods.Mrs. Oleander pushed a curtain aside and waved me into the space. A paisley silk dressing gown hung beside a long mirror. “Set your bag on the stool. Leave your trousers on but remove the bra and T-shirt. Put on the robe and tell me when you're ready.” She swished the drapery shut.My hands trembled as I knotted the sash around my thickened waist. I poked my head from the fitting room. “Ready.""Mrs. Oleander brandished a pale-blue measuring tape with ebony markings. “Lose the robe,” she commanded. As I undid the belt, I wondered why she had me put it on in the first place.Her long fingers fluttered along my ribcage as she wound the tape around my torso. “Thirty-eight. Forty-two. Nine and three-quarters. Gee. Interesting. Every Oleander bra has a magical feature, you see. We use lace, Duoplex, silk charmeuse and the occasional rubber band. No two Oleander bras are alike; each is as unique as its creator. And of course, you'll never get as good results with another's bra.""She turned on her heel and left. I shrugged back into the robe, tapping my fingers against my thigh, awaiting her return.""Right. Try this one. Italian power mesh with a muslin inlay. Thirty-eight band, G cup. Nice and flexible. A real workhorse. Pull it on and give it a bounce.""The damned thing looked like an oversize Ace bandage. I lay a hand against a wall, steadying myself. “G cups? Since when is that a thing?""""Used to be DDDD,” she said. “Took up too much space on the tags.""WTF? When did I get a rack that big? I took the industrial-strength bra dangling from her finger, fastened the endless row of hooks around my waist and swung the monster into place. Like slow-roasted eggplant still in its skin, my breasts sagged at the base of each cup. Mrs. Oleander unhooked the bra almost at once.""No, no, no. The cups are puckering. Much too big. And the band is pinching.” (Oh, gee. Thank the lord, I thought. A DDDD dressed up as a G? I'm not ready to have a bosom the confounding breadth of my Great Aunt Doris'.)""Try this. Balconette. Chantilly lace, handloomed in France. Forty E. Gives you a nice, rounded cleavage, with the top quarter of the breast exposed. Think romance, Paris, French doors open to a tiled terrace, a warm breeze giving movement to gauzy curtains.""I hooked and twisted. When I looked in the mirror, I saw side boobs bulging near my armpits, glistening slugs of flesh. Scarlet sparks flew from my eyes, but Mrs. Oleander's grin bloomed.""Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry. We'll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — nickel titanium underwiring, calibrated not to set off metal detectors …""Mrs. Oleander handed me the next brassiere. Its weight sent a sudden warmth through my fingers. I hooked and spun, straightened my spine and inspected my reflection. No bulges. Nice uplift. Cries of joy bubbled from my lips, silvery soap bubbles drifting toward the heavens.She clapped her hands. “Oh, brava! Yes, indeed. Very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...” I removed and handed her the brassiere and asked her to wrap it in tissue. As she moved toward the register, she was muttering.""Curious ... curious ...,” she said again.""What's curious?""Mrs. Oleander fixed me with her cerulean stare. “I remember every bra I've ever sold. Every single bra. It so happens that I've sold only one other of this brassiere. Just one.” She steepled her fingers under her chin and regarded me with interest. “Decades ago.""I gulped.""Curious how these things happen. The bra chooses the woman, remember. I sold its mate,” she drew in a breath, “to your mother.”My spirits sank. My bra-line did not.I handed her my credit card and Mrs. Oleander bowed me from the shop.","A bra that fits … that's what I'd been really looking forward to.The shop was chrome and glass. Silver cursive letters over the door read Oleanders: Purveyors of Fine Lingerie Since Day One. A single brassiere lay on a red satin pillow in the shop's window.As I opened the door, a hidden chime sounded the first five notes of Wagner'sRide of the Valkyries. The showroom's couches were fluffed to pillowy clouds. Along each wall, rows of metal railings holding hundreds of hangers dangled bras in a dazzling array of reds, blacks and creams, the canary yellows exotic birds among domestics. The entire room crackled with a secret magic.""Greetings,” said a rasping voice. I jumped. A tiny woman with leathery skin stood beside me, azure contacts gathering and reflecting the room's light.""Hello,” I said, swallowing.""Griselda Oleander,” she said with a slight bow. “I've been expecting you. All Women of a Certain Age find their bodies rapidly shifting. Elasticity fades. For the bosom, gravity is a harsh mistress.""I nodded a bow in return, then glanced down at my upper deck. Once perky in its own right, middle age after breastfeeding three children had indeed taken its toll. The hairs on the back of my neck prickled.""Can you help?” I lowered my chin to peer into her eyes. “Can you find one that fits?""""Hmmm.” She stared deeply into my chest. “That is not up to me. The bra, you see, chooses the woman. Follow me.” Her emerald skirt swished around her ankles as she led me to the back of the shop. The rear wall comprised three stalls, each six feet across. Instead of doors, heavy velvet curtains trailed from brass rods.Mrs. Oleander pushed a curtain aside and waved me into the space. A paisley silk dressing gown hung beside a long mirror. “Set your bag on the stool. Leave your trousers on but remove the bra and T-shirt. Put on the robe and tell me when you're ready.” She swished the drapery shut.My hands trembled as I knotted the sash around my thickened waist. I poked my head from the fitting room. “Ready.""Mrs. Oleander brandished a pale-blue measuring tape with ebony markings. “Lose the robe,” she commanded. As I undid the belt, I wondered why she had me put it on in the first place.Her long fingers fluttered along my ribcage as she wound the tape around my torso. “Thirty-eight. Forty-two. Nine and three-quarters. Gee. Interesting. Every Oleander bra has a magical feature, you see. We use lace, Duoplex, silk charmeuse and the occasional rubber band. No two Oleander bras are alike; each is as unique as its creator. And of course, you'll never get as good results with another's bra.""She turned on her heel and left. I shrugged back into the robe, tapping my fingers against my thigh, awaiting her return.""Right. Try this one. Italian power mesh with a muslin inlay. Thirty-eight band, G cup. Nice and flexible. A real workhorse. Pull it on and give it a bounce.""The damned thing looked like an oversize Ace bandage. I lay a hand against a wall, steadying myself. “G cups? Since when is that a thing?""""Used to be DDDD,” she said. “Took up too much space on the tags.""WTF? When did I get a rack that big? I took the industrial-strength bra dangling from her finger, fastened the endless row of hooks around my waist and swung the monster into place. Like slow-roasted eggplant still in its skin, my breasts sagged at the base of each cup. Mrs. Oleander unhooked the bra almost at once.""No, no, no. The cups are puckering. Much too big. And the band is pinching.” (Oh, gee. Thank the lord, I thought. A DDDD dressed up as a G? I'm not ready to have a bosom the confounding breadth of my Great Aunt Doris'.)""Try this. Balconette. Chantilly lace, handloomed in France. Forty E. Gives you a nice, rounded cleavage, with the top quarter of the breast exposed. Think romance, Paris, French doors open to a tiled terrace, a warm breeze giving movement to gauzy curtains.""I hooked and twisted. When I looked in the mirror, I saw side boobs bulging near my armpits, glistening slugs of flesh. Scarlet sparks flew from my eyes, but Mrs. Oleander's grin bloomed.""Tricky customer, eh? Not to worry. We'll find the perfect match here somewhere — I wonder, now — yes, why not — unusual combination — nickel titanium underwiring, calibrated not to set off metal detectors …""Mrs. Oleander handed me the next brassiere. Its weight sent a sudden warmth through my fingers. I hooked and spun, straightened my spine and inspected my reflection. No bulges. Nice uplift. Cries of joy bubbled from my lips, silvery soap bubbles drifting toward the heavens.She clapped her hands. “Oh, brava! Yes, indeed. Very good. Well, well, well ... how curious ... how very curious ...” I removed and handed her the brassiere and asked her to wrap it in tissue. As she moved toward the register, she was muttering.""Curious ... curious ...,” she said again.""What's curious?""Mrs. Oleander fixed me with her cerulean stare. “I remember every bra I've ever sold.

",10/1/2022,Self-Affirming Lessons That Come With Age on Being Biracial,"I am a 59-year-old female attorney of Filipino American descent who was repeatedly mistaken as the nanny of my own child. My son inherited the coloring of his father, a white man primarily of Danish ancestry. So, my son does not look like me.He has blue eyes and fair skin. That seemed to throw people off, and led to a lot of rude comments, as most people assumed I was his nanny.Such flawed assumptions based on my skin color occurred in other contexts as well. We belonged to a country club and a yacht club where, on more than one occasion, older women would ask me to take their drink orders, thinking I was a waiter.The dentist assumed I was the babysitter bringing my child into his office for the mother. The Gymboree class teacher assumed the same. Assumptions frequently overcome people’s manners in the questions posed to me by strangers.My parents were forbidden by law to marry in our home state of Maryland in 1962. So my Asian mother and Caucasian father crossed into the nearby District of Columbia to enter matrimony. Interracial marriage was illegal in 17 states until the U.S. Supreme Court declared such laws unconstitutional in 1967. Racism in this country has always been harsher towards African Americans, which likely is a remnant of slavery. The “one drop” rule used to govern race determination —  if a person had one drop of Black blood, they were considered to be Black. Passing as white used to be a virtue.Now that we have a vice president, Kamala Harris, who is is biracial, perhaps things will change. As Harris wrote in her 2018 autobiography,The Truths We Hold:“My mother understood very well she was raising two black daughters. She knew that her adopted homeland would see [my sister] Maya and me as black girls, and she was determined to make sure we would grow into confident black women.” And they did.The U.S. Census reflects how our society views race. In 1960, people could select their own race on the census questionnaire. Prior to that, an individual’s race was determined by the census-takers. It was not until 2000 that people could choose more than one race to describe themselves. In 2020, for the first time, the census form asks respondents who choose white or Black for their race to give more information about their origins, like if they are African American, Somali or another race or ethnicity. The latest U.S. Census statistics demonstrate that the multiracial population will be the fastest growing over the next several decades. Caucasians in the United States population are projected to be a minority in 2045. At that point, perhaps race will matter even less.While most of us in midlife and older grew up in a world of racial boundaries, our children grew up in a more accepting milieu. The concept of race has been somewhat deconstructed by the younger generation. A friend my age suffered greatly when her white parents refused to attend her wedding to a Black man. I do not think parents of our generation would do that.Interracial marriage increasingly is losing its taboo. I grew up with a double consciousness. I was frequently the only dark-skinned person in my schools, neighborhoods and workplaces. I was acutely aware of my surroundings, especially when I was the only person of color in a room. I felt instant kinship with people of different ethnicities and developed a chameleon-like persona, adapting to become whomever I thought others wanted me to be.Los Angeles resident Heidi Durrow, theNew York Timesbest-selling author ofThe Girl Who Fell From the Sky,didn’t really have a sense of what race was until she was 11 years old and her family moved to the U.S. from Denmark. She describes herself as an “Afro-Viking” — her mother is Danish and her father is African American.“We didn't talk about race at home,” Durrow told me. “Andi if I were to identify as anything, it would be as American and Danish. We spoke Danish at home and often visited with my mom’s family in Denmark.”  “But in America in the 1980s, it seemed like there were sharp lines between who was white and who was Black and what that meant,” Durrow continues. “I lived in a mostly Black neighborhood and tried my best to fit in. There wasn't any real discussion about being biracial when I was young. I thought it was confusing, but that’s just the way it was. It’s different for me now in midlife [at age 52], because I've had a chance to wrestle with the questions about my mixed identity through my writing and by creating community with others.”It was not until my 50s that I learned how to drop the rocks of self-judgment and of never feeling good enough. I embrace my half-Asian ethnicity and the differing perspective I can bring to a situation. Large corporations are increasingly recognizing this value in their marketing.I believe that with age comes acceptance and self-confidence. Jennifer Frappier, 45, of Los Angeles, whose heritage she cites as “Black, white and Filipino,” speaks to this point. After noticing many people staring at her as a child and realizing that she did not blend in, her mindset changed in middle age.“I know myself better and care much less about what others think,” she says. “In fact, I take pride in being different and sticking out.” As the mother of a multiracial child, she advises that parents need to let their children freely explore all parts of their background and know where they came from, so that they “can blossom into the beautiful human they are meant to be.”While I wish feeling good about who I am had happened earlier in my life, I know that everything in my past prepared me for this chapter. I now wear life like a loose garment, armed with self-knowledge and the ability to let go of that which I cannot control. I especially appreciate that I cannot control what others think of me.One of the gifts I gleaned and treasure from a lifetime of feeling other-than is the ability to make all people feel welcome.","I am a 59-year-old female attorney of Filipino American descent who was repeatedly mistaken as the nanny of my own child.

",29-06-2020,Why Middle-Aged and Older Women Are Trying TikTok,"Humans are social beings. We were not designed to be cooped up and cut off from our respective tribes. Even the most introverted among us yelled, “Mercy!” as the quarantine dragged on. As my husband, four teenagers and I prepared to start our fourth week of self-quarantine, I found myself remembering how naïve I was in the early days of our lockdown. Back then, I imagined perfectly organized closets, eight years’ worth of family vacation photos organized into glossy hard-covered albums and, at long last, my finished manuscript.One thing I never envisioned, however, was me, a woman in her late 40s, starting a TikTok account, yet here we are. And it turns out I'm not alone.When TikTok first launched in late 2016 it did not register on my radar because I was more than twice the age of its target market: teens 18 and under. The app gave kids exactly what they wanted; a space in which to create and share funny videos of themselves singing, dancing and lip-syncing to their favorite tunes. TikTok is all about entertainment and keeping it light. And those are things we all need right now, not just teens.So, while some people are deep into their banana breadbaking phase of quarantine, plenty of women in their 40s, 50s, 60s and beyond have embraced TikTok for the same reasons that it appeals to teens: because it's accessible and a departure from the harsh reality of the daily grind.According to areport published by Statistain February 2020, 19.4 percent of TikTok users are ages 40-50+. Compare that to 37.2 percent of users who are ages 10-19 and you get a sense of how strong our numbers are on the app.A couple of months ago BC (before corona), I was at a bar mitzvah and there was a talented magician who'd been hired as the entertainment. He was an entrepreneur with a decent social media following so I took the opportunity to pick his brain. We debated the merits of hashtag use and audience engagement, but ultimately, he had one clear message for me.""Get on TikTok,” he said.""But that's for people my kids’ ages, not for people like me,” I scoffed.""Trust me,” he persisted. “In a year from now, everyone you associate with on Instagram will be on TikTok, too. Don't be late to the party.” And off he sauntered.Did I run home that night and sign up? Of course not. But when I started to see some of my fellow content creators from Instagram and Twitter migrate over to TikTok, my interest piqued. I finally decided to try it out for myself because —well, quarantine. I didn't have the headspace to work on my book or learn a new language, but I had just about enough bandwidth to play around on TikTok and learn the ropes.And I am hooked.I asked social media expert Rachel Pedersen why she thought middle-aged women were flocking to TikTok and she said she'd been thinking about this a lot herself. Here's what she had to say.""People are tired of the highlight reels on Facebook, tired of the polished perfection of Instagram. On TikTok we see a more authentic side of people. We see people without makeup, including celebrities, and seeing the real side of life is addictive.”Pedersen, who has 192,000 TikTok followers and many more across other social media platforms, offered this next theory, which rang truer than anything I've heard in a long time.""I also think that this is about personality repression. All our lives we are told how to be in order to be accepted in society and that image may not truly reflect who we are. We are told to wear a blazer to be taken seriously, not to do things that are age inappropriate lest we make fools of ourselves. So, for women in their 40s and 50s and 60s who've been told by society that they're too old to rebrand themselves as the dancers, comedians or singers they've always wanted to be, TikTok gives them the perfect platform to stop repressing their personalities and ambitions and to find a welcoming audience.""This thinking is in line with the liberating phenomenon that many women experience when they hit their 40s and 50s and suddenly stop caring about what people think of them and are now ready to live on their own terms.Fellow writer Paige Kellerman, who inspired me to make the jump to TikTok, shared her thoughts on why it's so popular with an older demographic.""I think it's because it's more inclusive than Instagram, which is staged and pretty. And age doesn't seem to matter as long as you're entertaining.” You need not look any further than the many grandparent accounts with more than 1 million followers each for confirmation of this point.Lori Parker, a 51-year-old TikTokker from Arkansas with 35,000 followers, said that at first she was hesitant to join TikTok, but once she started posting videos a couple of years ago, she realized that this was “the perfect platform for an introvert like me! If you knew me in person, you'd never expect me to be on TikTok…. TikTok helps me be more outgoing, I think it's even spilled over into real life to some extent.""Parker said that around 50 percent of her following are in her same age bracket and, because they grew up in the ‘80s, had never seen anything like TikTok so now they are just having fun with it.An app that allows us to feel youthful even as we watch our hair go gray and the dewiness of our complexions evaporate for lack of access to any beauty technicians while we quarantine?

20,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/sex-lies-and-online-dating-over-age-50
",4/10/2021,"Sex, Lies and Online Dating Over Age 50","I am a 58-year-old woman who has gone on 100 online dates over the past two years. A few good dates — and too many that were really bad. There are many articles and books that give single women over 50 advice about getting out there and dating. I have found this barrage of how-to-find-love-again material contradictory.So, let me be straight up: This is not an advice column for ways to find a mate on a dating site. I read everything about dating over the age of 50 before I hopped online. I was hoping someone would tell it like it is. They have not, so I will. Here I will take you on my comical, awful, totally honest online search for companionship.How I Got Into ItI had been divorced for eight years, and my son was now a teenager and less dependent on me. I had moved to a new area withlotsof professional men over 50. I had quite a few 50-year-old friends doing online dating and saying they were finding a love match. I thought,Well I can do this, too. I am an attractive, accomplished woman, so now is the time to get out there and find that guy whom I deserve and deserves me. I crafted my online profile with seductive sayings such as: “Being Southern, I am very huggy and touchy, and say ‘sweetheart’ to everyone. Most importantly, I still rock the 6-inch heels at age 58!” Of course, I also posted the most flattering photos. I set my sights for men ages 50 to 65, with a bachelor’s degree or higher, a nonsmoker, and I had no preference for race, religion, height or weight.Really, I was just looking to have a fun, intelligent conversation with someone, with hopes that chemistry might be there!“It’s Not You and You’re Not Alone”The first hour I was online, I was rolling in the “likes” and felt as if I had just hit the Triple 7’s at a casino. I was thinking,This is great!In hindsight, I did not understand the game. Even though I did not engage with the young ones, I was excited when the 20- and 30-somethings hit me up. Come to find out, many of these people are not who they say they are. They are scammers trying to get in your pants or get your money by wooing you with sweet words. You talk/text with them for days and week. Then you hear, just when we were about to meet in person, something like this: “I have been robbed and I am stranded in Southern Chile, and can you please wire me $1,000 so I can finally meet you in person.”I thought,Is this for real?I did think it was bizarre that a man who said his job was as an “antique dealer” in one of the most rural parts of South America, close to Antarctica — but hey, everyone has his niche. Well, I did not wire the money but felt foolish for ignoring the other men while I focused on this thief for almost a month — because I was taken by his looks.More Lies, Lies, LiesOne thing I have learned about many online prospects is that they are really convincing liars. While I did not specify on my profile anything about height or weight, I did cite education expectations and, of course, expected them not to be married. I cannot count the number of “matches” online who claimed to be divorced but were living with wives and children.The one date that always comes to mind is the man who lied about everything. He lied about his age, his education, where he lived, his marital statusandhis employment. Although the fake image he portrayed when I agreed to a phone call turned out to be so fun, I said yes to meeting him in person. On that first and only date, he came clean about everything. His explanation: “If I told you the truth, you wouldn’t have gone out with me. And I find you fun and sexy and I want to have sex with you.”I was, like, “WHAT?”Sex, Sex and More SexThis is a “hot” topic that could be written into a 500-page book. Let me just say that the “three-date rule” to wait to have sex does apply. You know if you have sex within the first three dates, then bye-bye. Or, if you do not have sex within the first three or so dates, then bye-bye. Well, usually. I know there are people out there who had sex early on and then ended up marrying. That wasnotme. I know many sex experts say that we are all adults and to go out and enjoy yourself.OK, I want to enjoy myself, but I would like to see you again! The first few months of online dating, I sure did not know about the three-date rule and, well, it was bye-bye more than a few times. I was devastated!  I started asking men who had been online dating for a while, and they said, “If I know I’m not going to get any sex after three to five dates, then I am moving on.” Again, I was, like, “WHAT?”“All’s well that ends well. … Well, it ends”As of this writing, I am not online dating and am taking a long time-out to focus on me. My son is in college, I am an empty nester, love my work and have many friends who I cherish. I am not worried about scammers, being ghosted, losing sleep or wondering if I should/should not have sex with a guy. While I do not discourage online dating — as I have met some nice men and had interesting conversations. Just remember that next time you hop online, look at it as like having lots of “one-and-done fun.”","I am a 58-year-old woman who has gone on 100 online dates over the past two years. A few good dates — and too many that were really bad. There are many articles and books that give single women over 50 advice about getting out there and dating. I have found this barrage of how-to-find-love-again material contradictory.So, let me be straight up: This is not an advice column for ways to find a mate on a dating site. I read everything about dating over the age of 50 before I hopped online. I was hoping someone would tell it like it is. They have not, so I will. Here I will take you on my comical, awful, totally honest online search for companionship.How I Got Into ItI had been divorced for eight years, and my son was now a teenager and less dependent on me. I had moved to a new area withlotsof professional men over 50. I had quite a few 50-year-old friends doing online dating and saying they were finding a love match. I thought,Well I can do this, too. I am an attractive, accomplished woman, so now is the time to get out there and find that guy whom I deserve and deserves me. I crafted my online profile with seductive sayings such as: “Being Southern, I am very huggy and touchy, and say ‘sweetheart’ to everyone. Most importantly, I still rock the 6-inch heels at age 58!” Of course, I also posted the most flattering photos. I set my sights for men ages 50 to 65, with a bachelor’s degree or higher, a nonsmoker, and I had no preference for race, religion, height or weight.Really, I was just looking to have a fun, intelligent conversation with someone, with hopes that chemistry might be there!“It’s Not You and You’re Not Alone”The first hour I was online, I was rolling in the “likes” and felt as if I had just hit the Triple 7’s at a casino. I was thinking,This is great!In hindsight, I did not understand the game. Even though I did not engage with the young ones, I was excited when the 20- and 30-somethings hit me up. Come to find out, many of these people are not who they say they are. They are scammers trying to get in your pants or get your money by wooing you with sweet words. You talk/text with them for days and week. Then you hear, just when we were about to meet in person, something like this: “I have been robbed and I am stranded in Southern Chile, and can you please wire me $1,000 so I can finally meet you in person.”I thought,Is this for real?I did think it was bizarre that a man who said his job was as an “antique dealer” in one of the most rural parts of South America, close to Antarctica — but hey, everyone has his niche. Well, I did not wire the money but felt foolish for ignoring the other men while I focused on this thief for almost a month — because I was taken by his looks.More Lies, Lies, LiesOne thing I have learned about many online prospects is that they are really convincing liars. While I did not specify on my profile anything about height or weight, I did cite education expectations and, of course, expected them not to be married. I cannot count the number of “matches” online who claimed to be divorced but were living with wives and children.The one date that always comes to mind is the man who lied about everything. He lied about his age, his education, where he lived, his marital statusandhis employment. Although the fake image he portrayed when I agreed to a phone call turned out to be so fun, I said yes to meeting him in person. On that first and only date, he came clean about everything. His explanation: “If I told you the truth, you wouldn’t have gone out with me. And I find you fun and sexy and I want to have sex with you.”I was, like, “WHAT?”Sex, Sex and More SexThis is a “hot” topic that could be written into a 500-page book. Let me just say that the “three-date rule” to wait to have sex does apply. You know if you have sex within the first three dates, then bye-bye. Or, if you do not have sex within the first three or so dates, then bye-bye. Well, usually. I know there are people out there who had sex early on and then ended up marrying.

",8/7/2020,How Your OB-GYN Needs Change With Age,"I was the only nonpregnant woman in my ob-gyn's waiting room. I'd been there, done that. Did I still need a doctor who delivered babies? Flipping through magazine articles on childbirth, I was here to discuss vaginal irritation. Yet my long-trusted doc failed to identify what was wrong, offering no solution. I switched to a physician who limited her practice to gynecology, and she quickly diagnosed vaginal dryness — a postmenopausal condition I never knew existed. Her prescription for a hormone cream twice a week worked.As we age, our gynecological needs change from birth control and pregnancy tomenopause treatmentand osteoporosis screening. The decision to remain with your obstetrician is a personal choice.""It depends if you have a doctor you like and who knows your history,” says Lila Nachtigall, M.D., a professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at NYU Langone Health. “Many patients use the same doctor who delivered their babies well after menopause.”Obstetricians may have unpredictable schedules, but you can get top-quality care from doctors who deliver and those who don't. The two most important factors to keep in mind: Your gynecologic needs can't be generalized solely by age, and it's essential to continue with annual gyn exams to ensure overall good health.Breast exams and mammograms: Necessity and frequencyAlthough there is debate in the medical community over whether clinical breast exams are needed, the American Academy of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends them annually at 40+, with shared decision-making between patient and doctor. Nachtigal agrees with ACOG, and stresses continued need for annual breast exams well into your 70s, since risk of breast cancer increases with age.The most skilled practitioners in this area are ob-gyns. “Most radiologists no longer do clinical breast exams at the time of mammogram,” says Audrey Buxbaum, M.D., a gynecologist in private practice at Downtown Women OB/GYN Associates in Manhattan.The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) advises mammograms every two years for women 50 to 74 with average risk, and says there isn't enough evidence to conclude whether it's of benefit to women 75 and older. Some doctors disagree, claiming these guidelines are based on cost controls, rather than preventive care.The older you are,the greater your risk for breast cancer. “Older women need annual mammograms,” Nachtigall says. “It has been shown over and over how early detection saves lives.""Menopause: During and afterMenopause takes center stage during exams in your 50s, but concerns can continue for 15 years.Buxbaum focuses on symptoms: urinary, vaginal, sexual health — during and after menopause. “I also remind patients about other health maintenance, such as colonoscopies, vaccines and bone density tests.""Discuss the pros and cons with your doctor to determine whether you should get systemic estrogen therapy. “Make sure your doctor is comfortableaddressing menopausal issuesand prescribing HRT if needed,” Buxbaum suggests.Nachtigall is also on board regarding hormone replacement therapy, in some cases recommending that women with hot flashes stay on medication well after menopause.Vaginal dryness: Let's talk about it""A lot of doctors don't bring up the sensitive subject of vaginal dryness or sexual problems such as pain with intercourse,” Nachtigall observes. Doctors may think it'll take too much time or be embarrassing for the patient. But after menopause, most women encounter vaginal dryness, which can cause pain, itching and uncomfortable sex. The good news: “There are now so many good treatments — some hormonal, others nonhormonal,” Nachtigall says. “Almost every woman can get beneficial treatment without side effects.""Pap smears: Should they be eliminated?The current recommendation of ACOG is to forgo regular Pap smears after age 65 if you have no history of precancerous cells or cervical cancer.Don't rejoice that you'll avoid another cold speculum exam, though. “Pap smears are nearly 100 percent preventative for cervical cancer — the one cancer we understand well,” Nachtigall notes. “It's caused by the HPV [human papillomavirus] virus, which you get from sexual contact, not from age.""She urges sexually active women to continue getting annual Pap smears — not only if your sexual partner is new but also if you've been long married and monogamous.""We need to prevent cervical cancer, since there is no cure,” Nachtigall emphasizes. While cervical cancer tends to occur during midlife, more than 15 percent of cases are in women over 65.Making the Most of Your Annual VisitDoctors see more patients than ever before. Come prepared with a list of questions and concerns.Buxbaum's advice: “Have recent bloodwork results — such as lipids, blood count, kidney function — as well as a current list of all medications and supplements. Update any new surgeries, medical problems and family history, as these become more complex as people age.""""Volunteering information saves time and gets you help,” Nachtigall adds. “Tell the doctor about any vaginal discomfort, pelvic pain, discharge or odor — or else the doctor may not see it during an exam.”","I was the only nonpregnant woman in my ob-gyn's waiting room.

",18-08-2020,I  Couldn't Change My Age to Find a Job,"The pain reminded me of the first few seconds after you badly cut your hand, when the throbbing finally kicks in. I’m referring to my experience with a chemical peel.In December of last year I became one of 1.3 million women who had this peel in 2019, according to a report from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The group found that it’s the third most popular minimally invasive cosmetic procedure. OK, maybe I've exaggerated about the extent of the pain. But it is true that during the first few hours after the doctor applied the acid solution to my face, I wanted to cut my head off. As the pain intensified, I wanted to cut the doctor’s head off. And when my husband said, “Well, you know how low your pain tolerance is,” I wanted to relieve him of his head and a few other body parts.Why did I go through this? I was sure I was discriminated against when it came to job hunting because I looked older than my age, 71. I wasn’t ready to stop working, and most other women my age never seemed to appear as old as me. My face looked like it had deep wrinkles (makeup would fill the crevices), probably due to smoking. And, thanks to years of tanning, brown spots had sprouted all over it as well. So I took the plunge. I had read that this procedure could make your skin look younger and healthier, and that medium or deep peels could remove the wrinkles that had taken up residence on my face. Eschewing all procedures and growing old gracefully is one thing; losing your livelihood is another.It was the pain after I got home that afternoon which put me to the test. One of the doctor’s assistants had recommended alternating Tylenol, Advil and aspirin for pain relief, but that wasn’t doing it for me. I think that’s what she said, anyway. I had been so nervous before the procedure — it was my face, for God’s sake. I decided to call the doctor to ask if I could take an oxycodone on top of the four pills he had given me at the beginning of the procedure, one of which must have put me into a twilight sleep. He said yes.I hadn’t asked the doctor what the pills were, or what type of acid he’d be using (such as glycolic, salicylic or trichloroacetic), which is not like me. I usually want to know everything about any medical procedure. But my regular dermatologist had recommended this procedural dermatologist, and a friend saw him every fall to have brown spots — from sun damage — removed.More reasons to put my full confidence in him? He’s done peels on at least two of the women in his office, and they looked great. Not only that, he’s lectured other dermatologists at conferences. He wouldn’t actually be lecturing others if he stunk at this, right?I can’t say whether I was truly confident or just nervous and didn’t want to know everything, but if I had it to do over, I’d ask a lot more questions. I remember a brush gently stroking my face during a few seconds of consciousness, and that’s it. I don’t even know if I had a medium or a deep peel. (There’s light, medium and deep.)The doctor told me my face would throb awhile that afternoon, but that it would be gone by dinnertime. Instead I experienced actual pain, like I imagined going 10 rounds with Mike Tyson would feel. I was glad I had an oxycodone on hand from my son’s appendix surgery years earlier.I took it and fell asleep, and when I awoke the pain was gone. The next few days and weeks weren’t bad at all. Three times a day for about a week I took a shower and washed my face with baby shampoo and then a special soap containing salicylic acid and charcoal. The outer layer of skin peeled off during those showers but it wasn’t painful.Afterward I slathered my face with Vaseline and slept with a towel over my pillow. I stayed inside for just under 15 days, if I recall, and saw the doctor once during that time so he could check how things were going. I saw him two or three more times, AND when we agreed that the acid didn’t take in two spots, he reapplied the solution to those areas. I had to deal with the pain again, but this time I didn’t need an oxycodone, and the skin peeled quickly.Then the coronavirus hit New York and New Jersey with a vengeance, and our doctors stopped in-person visits. The last thing his office staff had talked about was my starting Retin-A, so I returned in July when he started seeing patients in person again.The reactions to my new skin (which is what I now sport) have been interesting. At a dental appointment soon afterward, a technician I’ve known for years gave me a confused look and said, “I think I know you but I don’t remember your name.” I laughed and mentioned the peel.When three other female employees overheard me, they crowded around with questions and to take a closer look. My friends still comment on how much younger and more awake I appear, and how much healthier my skin looks.I paid $4,000 for the peel — and now that I wear a mask when I go out, my face isn’t even visible except around the eyes. Still, was it worth it? Without a doubt. I’d do it again, even with the pain.","The pain reminded me of the first few seconds after you badly cut your hand, when the throbbing finally kicks in.

",8/7/2020,The Most Important Exercises You Can Do After Age 50,"You've heard the tales: “Oy! My hip!” Or: “Oh! My aching back!""But a problem hip and an aching back aren't inevitable as you age. They're preventable ... if you do some key exercises to support and stabilize your body as you get older. Already there? Improve your problem spots and age gracefully with these fitness tips.Balance:This becomes increasingly more important as you age, says Chris Clough, an elite trainer based in Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Anyone over the age of 50 shouldpractice balancingdaily - and there's a super easy way to do it. When you're using the microwave, practice standing on one foot for 10-30 seconds, Clough says. Make sure you're within safe reach of the counter. Don't microwave often? Try balancing while brushing your teeth within reach of the sink.Cardio:It's crucial to keep your heart healthy and strong to prevent heart disease, says Michael Kuang, CEO of Syphon Fitness, a holistic fitness company specializing in personal training, corrective exercise and yoga. When you do cardio, make sure you find exercises that are low impact so you won't place undue pressure on your joints. Rowing is a great option for adults over 40 who are hoping to improve their cardio endurance, looking to torch calories, strengthen their muscles and eliminate high impact on their joints, says Caley Crawford, director of education for Row House, a national boutique rowing concept. “Recruiting over 80 percent of muscles in the body, rowing is a surefire way to spike the heart rate, and one's pace is easily modifiable if he or she wants to dial down the intensity,” Crawford says.Weights:Thesekeep your muscles toned and strong, and they help with arthritis or osteoporosis, Kuang says. Weights will also help with posture. Try bent over rows: Take some light dumbbells or a barbell (5-10 pounds to start) and stand with your feet slightly apart, says Cary Williams, CEO of Boxing & Barbells in California. Bring your hips back as you lower your torso. Lower the weights while keeping a straight back, keeping your knees slightly bent. Then pull the weights up to the side of your body near your hips. Do three sets of 8-10 reps.Hip bridges:This activates and engages the gluteal muscles. Translation: You can develop low back pain if these muscles are weak, as they are the prime movers of your lower body, Kuang says. Here's how you do it: Lay on the ground with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, about 4 inches apart. Keep your arms next to your body. Press into your feet and arms to lift your hips off the ground. Keep your knees in line with your feet (a yoga block between your knees will add more stability). Bring your hips up as high as you can comfortably. You can hold the position for 30 seconds, or do repetitions with the hips going up and down 20 times for 2-3 rounds.Kneeling lunge:If you've been sitting all day, then your hips will start to get tight. This exercise will help, Kuang says. Sit on your knees on a supportive mat, bringing one leg forward and keeping the foot flat. Make sure your ankle and your knee are lined up. Bring the kneeling leg back a few inches so your knee is behind your hip. Bend into the front knee just a bit, and you should feel a stretch of the hip with the knee that's behind your body. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Do each side 2-3 times.Plank:Strengthen your core with the plank, which will also greatly help with stability and your back muscles. You can do a simple plank on your toes and forearms (or move to your knees on a mat if that was too strenuous), holding it for 15 seconds. Rest for 5 and then do it again, Williams says. Start with eight sets and build up to 30 seconds with a 5 second rest, three days a week.","You've heard the tales: “Oy! My hip!” Or: “Oh!

Bring the kneeling leg back a few inches so your knee is behind your hip. Bend into the front knee just a bit, and you should feel a stretch of the hip with the knee that's behind your body. Hold the stretch for 30 seconds. Do each side 2-3 times.Plank:Strengthen your core with the plank, which will also greatly help with stability and your back muscles. You can do a simple plank on your toes and forearms (or move to your knees on a mat if that was too strenuous), holding it for 15 seconds. Rest for 5 and then do it again, Williams says. Start with eight sets and build up to 30 seconds with a 5 second rest, three days a week."

",10/5/2021,"Are You Aiming for 100? Not Your Test Score, but Your Age?","When my niece posted on a text-message thread an article about the oldest living Marine, Dorothy SchmidtCole, who died at age 107 this past January, my 97-year-old mother, Mildred, commented, “I will try to beat her record.”At the rate she’s going, I won’t be surprised if she does. Her two main doctors — young, handsome and smart — both said Mom’s blood work is better than theirs. Although 31 years her junior, it’s my mom I turn to when I can’t read labels (even while I’m wearing my 3.0 magnifying glasses) and when I can’t find my keys.Her high cheekbones and widow’s peak are still prominent, but her once full lips have vanished. Mom continues to bleach her own hair blond. She doesn’t miss an opportunity to play cards with the girls and to dine in a fine restaurant. She always leaves home all dolled up, with a snazzy outfit and matching shoes.People keep telling me, “You have good genes.” Yet my brother got cancer and died at age 72.At 66, I’m hoping to make it to 100 years old — if I’m still fit mentally and physically. I have come to believe what my mother tells me: “Age is just a number.”During the last decade, the number of seniors who’ve reached their 100th birthdays has nearly doubled, from 53,000 in 2010 to 92,000 in 2020. Women are the overwhelming majority in the super-ager pack, comprising approximately 80 percent of the centenarian population, as cited by the U.S. Census Bureau.KathrinBoerner, a research scientist on aging at the University of Massachusetts, said that beyond staying as healthy as possible with diet and exercise, longevity comes down to seniors asking themselves, “How do I cope with what I’ve got? It’s the strength of their adaptive capacity.”The average age of patients in Peter Cowan’s medical practice in West Palm Beach, Florida, spans the 80s. With deep experiences in treating the inevitable health challenges of an older population, he finds it’s the women who have that better adaptive capacity.“Most of my late-90s- or even 100-year-old patients have been women,” Cowan says. “I had a 96-year-old you would think was 80. How did they get to their 80s? Did they run or limp there? I think a lot of men were less careful with their health care. Women stay in better shape. They are better at staying involved with other people. I have a 90-year-old woman who, before COVID-19, still went to Zumba classes at the gym at 8 a.m.”Tom Perls, M.D., is the founder and director of the New England Centenarian Study, the largest study of centenarians and their families in the country. He, too, calls women “the true winners” in the longevity marathon.“The biological reasons for this have not been proven, though there are some tempting hypotheses that scientists are pursuing,” Perls says. “An obvious difference between men and women is that women have two X chromosomes, and there are a bunch of genes on the X chromosome that are important to slower aging, such as the DNA repair genes.”We all know of older celebrity women who are role models for their vitality and productivity. Judi Dench, 86, just released a new film,Blithe Spirit.Jane Fonda, 82, and Lily Tomlin, 81, produced and starred in the seven-season Netflix hitGrace and Frankie. Betty White, 99, was still at work in 2019 as a voice actor in the filmToy Story 4.Gerontologists point to three arteries of life that contribute to aging well: staying fit with movement and diet; staying connected to a supportive and intimate community; and staying engaged with lifelong brain activity, be it with gardening or crossword puzzles or continuing education classes. These super-agers make sure they have something to look forward to every day, which helps them stay relevant and instills a will to live.My mother certainly embodies these three elements. She’s up and out by 7 a.m. to head to the athletic center, where she exercises for 20 minutes on the recumbent bike. To work the rest of her body, she does a 20-minute chair workout by following a fitness video on YouTube. Then it’s time for breakfast, which is yogurt mixed with fresh fruit. Her other meals consist of protein and vegetables.She went from lying about her age to wearing it like a badge of honor. Mom often pulls out the age card, batting her eyelashes at waiters and saying: “You know, I’m 97.” She stares at them until they melt and return with a free glass of wine.Peter Martin, professor of gerontology at Iowa State University, often tells his audiences when he makes his presentations: “If men want to become 100, they have to start behaving a lot more like women.”Another strong female role model is 96-year-old Olga Murray. She’s been divorced for many years and has two stepchildren that are like her own. After retiring as a staff attorney with the California Supreme Court in 1992, she has been unstoppable.While trekking fromPokhara to Siklesin the Himalayan mountains in Nepal in 1984, she walked through remote villages where children lived in poverty. These kids had little access to schools, and Olga established a foundation that provides funds to educate them. Her days now start at 6:30 a.m., when she listens to NPR, and then she works out with a trainer and still does some foundation work.“I’d love to be a centenarian if I could live as I’m living now,” says Murray from her Sausalito, California, home, which has a view of the Richardson Bay. “I wake up in the morning and I see the water.”Though the prospect of a long life is appealing to most, not everyone wants to be a centenarian. Davida Rosenblum, 95, who has a Ph.D. from Columbia University, gives an adamant “No!” when asked if she wants to reach the 100 mark. “Because my illnesses are getting worse,” she adds, talking about her diabetes and other health conditions. Rosenblum admits that she never exercised or was careful about the foods she consumed. She was more consumed with intellectual pursuits: “I’ve always been curious about life and I always loved reading. I’ve never felt a loss for what I have done.”The good news, I learned from medical experts, is that genetics plays a smaller role in life expectancy than we believe.“There is no one single predictor of longevity,” Iowa State professor Martin explained. “The basic components are family history, environment, support, personality, behavioral skills, and then physical and mental health. It’s not just genes. You also learn from your family to have a certain lifestyle.”Mom has certainly passed on to me her courage and sense of adventure. Together we have explored India, where we rode on an elephant, went on a pre-sunrise rowboat ride in the Ganges River and watched the morning cremations, and later had our hands tattooed with henna. On my own, I have chartered sailboats in the unfamiliar waters of Sweden.I look at this wise and spry woman, who lost her husband 15 years ago and recently lost a son, and ask her for her secret to living so long.“I don’t try to change things I can’t,” my mom says with a big smile. “I accept people for who they are. And if I don’t like them, I just avoid them. I live life as if I was 50 years old. I also hang around with people who are 10 to 30 years younger. If I want to go to the bar, I go to the bar. If I want to travel, I travel. If I want to drive, I drive.

",10/7/2020,The Truth About Your Eyes as You Age,"When I was 25, I got laser eye surgery, tossed out my glasses and had a celebration for my permanent perfect vision.I wasn't looking ahead (pun intended) to my 40s, 50s and 60s when, like most people, I'd find myself back at the optometrist with a brand new prescription. Turns out, there's little we can do to stop our eyes from aging — but there are some proactive steps we can take to prevent serious damage and to prepare our eyes for the future.""All parts ofeyes undergo changes as we age, and those changes all have an impact on our vision quality,” says Jin Gao, an optometrist at Philadelphia-based Eye Love Eyewear. “However, the rate of change can be different for each person, depending on each person's family history, lifestyle, occupation, diet and more.""But for starters, expect to have to pop on a super-trendy pair of reading glasses around the age of 40. It only gets more fun from there.Your eyes in your 50sPresbyopia, or the difficulty to focus on objects up close, typically hits in your early 40s and continues to advance through your 50s and beyond, says Ryan Parker, an optometrist and director of professional education at lens manufacturer Essilor in Dallas. That's because as you age, your natural defense mechanisms begin to decline. Based on your genetics and diet, this may be a good time toincrease vitamin supplements for your eyes.As you get closer to your 60s, the risk of more eye diseases increases, such as cataracts, glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment. Preventive measures include eating a diet filled with dark leafy greens, wearing UV-blocking sunglasses and reducing smoking, Gao says.If you're spending a significant amount of time in front of the computer screen, you should invest in blue-light lenses, which can help combat the negative effects of screen time leading to retinal damage, says Toni Albrecht, an optometrist at InVision Optical in Minneapolis.Women who are going through menopause or are postmenopause may also experience dry eyes at this time. Keeping your eyes lubricated with eye drops is important.Your eyes in your 60sAs you cross into your 60s, the risk for many ocular diseases continues to increase. “This decade is the first time that many people experience the first signs of a cataract, a gradual clouding of the intraocular lens,” Parker says. “People may notice trouble driving at night, needing more light to see and difficulty with color perception.""If you have a strong family history of eye diseases such as glaucoma, macular degeneration and retinal detachment — or if you're diabetic — you should start having annual dilated eye exams, Gao says.Postwork headaches become more common because as you age, eye fatigue occurs, and your accommodation system in the back of your eyes weakens over time. It becomes more difficult for your lens to change shape and give adequate power, and the muscle in the back of your eye has to work harder, Gao says. Cue the reading glasses or progressive lenses!Your eyes post-70After the age of 70, almost all patients will have advancing cataracts and may need to have cataract surgery, Parker says. Plus, the risk for vision-threatening ocular conditions continues to increase.

I don’t let on when I can’t remember an author’s name I’ve been quoting for decades, surreptitiously Googling it, hoping they don’t notice.After class, on Tuesdays, I cherish senior discounts at my local pharmacy. I feel pretty spry, noticing that I’m the youngest shopper in the store.“Senior discount, ma’am?” the cashier says before I can request it. I don’t need to show proof. With my 20 percent savings, I treat myself to a cappuccino with an extra shot of espresso. My metabolism can always use a bolt of caffeine. At least I don’t take afternoon naps. Not yet."

",3/9/2021,"After Painful Losses, I Am Finally Living My Dream Life at Age 55","In my youthful dreams I imagined myself an actor, a farmer, a writer and an owner of a charming inn or bed-and-breakfast. I wanted to live in a big, exciting city (for the acting part of my life), then in the countryside (for the farming decades) and, finally, somewhere in between, where my bed-and-breakfast would sit perched on a hill overlooking some body of water.

As a teenager in Norway, I never dreamt of marriage, children or a house in the suburbs. I was 19 when I arrived in America, and had only planned to stay for a year as an au pair to perfect my English and see the country.I never thought I would actually end up here, nor did Iever,in my wildest agnostic fantasy, imagine I’d have a Jewish wedding and raise a Jewish family. Yet all that kind of just happened.I'm 55 now, and was 23 when I converted to Judaism and married a gregarious man from Connecticut. I got hitched so young and very contrary to my mother’s Gloria Steinemesque idea of not getting married until I had ""seen the world.” She was well traveled, 29 and already pregnant when she got married.I’ve wondered about how much setting intentions matters in how our lives turn out. This, in turn, has made me realize how going with the flow (of the universe, of opportunities, of chance) — like I feel I did until I was in my 40s — can bring many gifts, often the ones that remain, despite inevitable changes and losses.For me, what remains are my three now-grown sons, a solid Jewish identity and the priceless life experience gained from all those non-dream “accomplishments.” But when I reached my mid-40s, having been swept along by ideals and trajectories shaped by things exterior to myself, it set me up for a more mindful second chapter. It wasn’t a pretty transition, and there was pain. A lot of pain.I voluntarily moved out of our large suburban villa into a condo down the street, and we shared custody of our three sons. During a tenuous period filled with emotional ambiguity and rising lawyers’ fees, I cried a lot and drank too much in an effort to not feel the pain. In this cloud of misery, I wrote thoughtless texts, emails, and blogs that hurt feelings and ended relationships. My ex-in-law family that were my beloved tribe disowned me.Through yoga, meditation, therapy and writing, I turned inward for my own guidance, and slowly found my footing and began to reimagine a path forward. I actively mined those youthful dreams by putting them front and center in my imagination. When I went to bed at night, I returned again and again to elaborate fantasies and asked myself,Where can I go? What can I learn? How can I grow?By the time my three sons launched from the nest, I had won awards for my teaching, and realized that to successfully turn students into a captivated audience required skills used in acting. Despite my stage fright, I challenged myself to dive into live storytelling and improv theater.My new partner, a native of Maine I had known since my college days and reconnected with, pulled me northward, toward a rugged climate and state where I felt right at home. Not only is he also a convert to Judaism, he’s a passionate gardener, and I’ve become his dedicated sous-gardener. Today kale, tomatoes, apples, peppers and herbs thrive on our modest but lush lot. I’m not raising prize pigs or organic eggs, but I live closer to the rhythms of nature and cultivate the soil.In mid-coast Maine where we live, we converted our raw barn from 1865 into a unique Airbnb, and during our busy summer months, I relish offering extra touches for our guests: a fresh bouquet of cut flowers from the garden, a locally milled soap, Maine blueberry muffins from the farmers market.

",29-06-2020,How Music Keeps Me Connected to My College-Age Son,"“Have you heard the new Vampire Weekend song?” my son asked. We were in my car, in a parking lot off of Route 95. One of Phin's roommates was picking him up at this meeting spot and bringing him back to school.He played “Sunflower,” and we listened together. I nodded my head to the beat. “I like it,” I told him. “Add it to my playlist.""“Already did,” he said. He leaned over for a quick goodbye hug. His ride had just pulled up. And just like that, he was gone again.My 21-year-old son is a junior in college, which means Iwasseeing less of him all the time. There were internships, jobs and friends to fill his breaks. But we had our Spotify playlist. It was Phin's gift to me three years ago when he left home, a way to stay connected through music.Now that we are back living under the same roof — sharing space, chores and the daily stress of self-isolation — I appreciate the playlist more than ever as a gentle form of communication.He named it “Sandra Sings!” And sing I do, to artists I never would have discovered if it weren't for my music-obsessed son, for whom every life event must have a soundtrack. He is constantly updating the list, prompting me to love Sufjan Stevens, or asking what I think about the new release by Chance the Rapper.Even if a song is not to my taste, I always give it a good listen and try my best to like it. As the mother of a boy who is boisterous and outspoken, but not always forthcoming with his deepest feelings, I look for other clues to who he is and what he loves. And since music is a language that we both speak decently well, I sometimes find a bit of his heart on that playlist.More recently, the sudden switch to social distancing together has brought with it some expected relationship challenges, but nothing a new song can't smooth over.Usually, Phinny randomly adds songs that will come on when I'm gardening or driving with the list set to shuffle. Most are by contemporary artists I've never heard of, but there are oldies, too, like “Rocketman” and “Dancin’ in the Moonlight,” songs I would have listened to on my mother's yellow kitchen radio that played nonstop through my childhood.The playlist forces me to stay open-minded about music, the way I've always encouraged Phinny to be when it comes to my taste in the arts. Several years back, I joked to my husband that all of my favorite musicians were either dead or in their final years. But thanks to Phinny, not anymore.One day I had just pulled into the Stop ‘n’ Shop parking lot, when Phinny sent a text:“You're going to love this one by Atta Boy.”I clicked on the link and listened to “Walden Pond” all the way through. By the end I was sobbing, thinking of my little boy that I used to take swimming in that very pond every summer. He was now a young man who understood how that place — that pond — still held so much of my heart.I have a shoebox full of mixtapes in my basement. There are dozens, including Sandy Goes to Tokyo, a gift from my boss when I left the bright lights of L.A. and moved to Japan. There is another called Kool Women and Lovely Ladies, which features some of my favorite female artists, from Joni Mitchell to Cyndi Lauper. A friend sent it to me when I was living in Europe. I listened to nothing else for weeks. Something about those songs captured my sense of homesickness, and I still think that that tape was instrumental in my decision to move back to the States, after seven years abroad.When Phinny first went to college, I tried to talk to him every week or so, but soon, the calls were spaced further apart. Now in year three, he is home again, but he's often in his room doing Zoom classes, FaceTiming friends and writing papers.So when I need a lift or am feeling disconnected, I open up our playlist, knowing there will be a song waiting.","“Have you heard the new Vampire Weekend song?” my son asked.

",8/7/2020,Be Warned: These Well-Intended Comments Are Actually Ageist,"Sometimes even the best of intentions don’t turn out well. With that in mind, we’d like to eradicate these popularly used phrases that demean older people even when they are meant to be compliments.“You look great!”On the surface, this certainly appears to be a compliment. But scratch below that surface and therein lies the (twofold) problem. Under fold one is whether the speaker had to bite her tongue to stop from adding “for your age.” Many older people hear it even when it’s unspoken. And then there is fold two: Who says “great” anymore? Certainly no self-respecting millennial. “Great” is a second cousin twice removed from “sexy,” “hot” and “amazing.” Thanks, but give us one of those descriptors instead, please.“You don’t look 65!”First, the logic: If I’m 65, then this is what 65 looks like. Makes sense, no?The problem lies in the speaker’s perception — that being young is good and, conversely, being old is bad. So when someone tells you that you don’t look your age, they may see it as complimenting you for defying the aging process. But there are many ways to flatter someone by recognizing her accomplishments — acknowledging that she was born with genes that don’t produce as many wrinkles just isn’t one of them.Plus, not to state the obvious, but every living being grows older every day. And that’s a good thing, considering the alternative. In fact, some things get better with age — and not just fine wine. Studies have shown thatsex improves as you grow older. Chalk it up to practice and experience!“My grandma is so adorable.”Yeah, she’s so darling that you just can’t resist demeaning her, huh? “Adorable” is a term best applied to puppies and babies. When used to describe someone older, it infantilizes the person. It’s time to lose “adorable,” along with “cute,” and maybe stick to language that shows some respect.Ageism occurs when we stop defining people as individuals and view them only in terms of their age. Older people are frequently seen as incompetent, and infantilizing them fuels the idea that they actually are.And while we are breaking bad habits here, maybe quit posting “funny” things like how your mom hasn’t caught on that LOL doesn’t mean lots of love. The notion that older people aren’t internet savvy is bogus and more than a little outdated. They may not have been born with a device in their hand or even been early adapters to a digitally managed life, but most have caught up with technology to some degree. Older people regularly shop and bank online, use social media platforms and rely on their devices for work, entertainment and communications. When you mock their mistakes in public forums, it’s hurtful, not amusing.So before you post your mom’s next goof, just remember, she likely still has that photo of 2-year-old you naked in the bathtub, and she really does know how to attach it to an email.“Can I help you, young lady?”Once again, when you are speaking to a woman who is clearly older, you think this is a compliment. But why reference her age at all? You are reinforcing the cultural value that young is good and old is bad and assuming that calling her a young lady will flatter her. It won’t. Take the woman’s order, ask how you can help, and just do your job. Would you ever in a million years ask a teenager, “Want some freshly grated Parmesan cheese, old woman?” Of course not. So don’t do it here.This may be hard to believe, but there were times in history when elders were actually venerated. They held the most powerful positions in the family and community because of their knowledge and wisdom. The industrial revolution changed much of that, as mobility increased and younger people moved beyond the extended family circle in the pursuit of jobs. As the elders’ roles diminished, so did how older people were regarded in society.So no more “young lady,” please. No more “old-timer,” either. No more “humorous” birthday cards expressing regrets about being a year older. No more “Honey,” “Dear” or “She’s 70 years young.”“Old dogs can't learn new tricks.”This is actually not even true of canines. We all learn new things every day; we just need to be incentivized. Don’t believe me? Just dangle a liver snap in front of my 12-year-old pooch (or a well-paying job in front of an unemployed 65-year-old) and watch what happens.This old-dog-new-tricks comment puts all older folks into the same pot and generalizes that they are not educable or retrainable. It’s an attitude that has caused great financial pain to older workers because it reinforces the false notion that they are incapable of adjusting to the new demands of the workplace.Age has nothing to do with it. Willingness to change and learn is everything. Just ask any of the millions of Americans who areover 65 and still working.As a recentGerontological Society of America reportstated, “Demography is not destiny. The way people and countries respond to an aging society will determine the future.”“60 is the new 30.”I’m not even sure what that means. At 30, I was launching a career; at 60, I was preparing to retire from it.At 30, I stayed up all night; at 60, I go down with the sun and luxuriate at the ability to do so. At 30, I cared what strangers thought; at 60, strangers don’t matter, only my loved ones do.Stop acting like being older is something to be unhappy about.

30,"https://www.aarpethel.com/work-money/how-ageism-tainted-my-70th-birthday-as-a-tv-anchor
",8/10/2021,How Ageism Tainted My 70th Birthday as a TV Anchor,"I recently turned 70.It has taken me more than four months simply to be able to write those four words. I’m not age-phobic. I know it’s a blessing that I’ve been around for seven decades. I know I should celebrate longevity and good health, like my mother does, a vibrant woman of 91 who does yoga.Yet a feeling of shame often arises when I remember I am actually the number 70. And I’m ashamed to admit that I feel shame. I wouldn’t feel this way if I were a doctor still practicing my profession at 70. I certainly wouldn’t feel this way if I were a 70-year-old athlete or author. Instead, I have been a news anchor in the same community for close to 40 years. Along with my reporting, I get paid to look my best. But even though our audience has watched me age, it’s a requirement that I somehow look ageless.I have not had plastic surgery. After too many elective surgeries for other medical reasons, I am not anxious to go under the knife again. Still, I spend precious hours each day doing every other thing imaginable to maintain the illusion of youth, using the best make-up products and, lately, applying false eyelashes.My blow-dryer, flat iron and hair spray are as essential as my computer. And my hair has been blond forever! I wear sexy clothes, not because I want to but because it is a job requirement for women, at every age.So what’s with the shame? Older male anchors get to be admired, despite their paunches and no hair and wrinkles. Women in showbiz are expected to fight it and get depressed by how our accumulation of birthdays changes our bodies. Friends my age talk about becoming invisible. I understand what they mean. Off the air, I, too, can feel like an older woman blending into the woodwork while the attention gravitates toward those who are half my age. On air, I am in a position where I can’t be overlooked. Profit margins depend on me being very visible, appearing eternally youthful.I am not young. I am 70. I am also very good at my job. When my big birthday was announced on the air … let’s just say not all the responses were “congratulations.” Yes, I get lots of support in my Facebook feed and even in letters from older women who see me as a role model, enduring the pressures of ageism in my profession and in our world.But there was also this ugly stream of other reactions, on email and social media: “You old hag! Just retire already.”“Will you just retire already and give some young woman a chance.”How do I know these messages come from men? Sometimes it’s easy to click on their Twitter profile. Sometimes they leave a first name. But as far as I know, no woman has ever sent me such sentiments.I know they’re just words, but words have power. They can crumble a wall of confidence built by years of praise and accomplishments. And words alluding to the uselessness of an “old woman” can send me into tears.I feel a stab in the stomach, a rush of anger. The words echo in my mind, and then the questioning begins: “Are they right?” “Should I quit?” Then I become defiant. No one can judge when I’m not longer fit for this job. I am excellent at my job. And I am not alone in enduring these ageist attacks in our profession. When I started out in this business, women anchors were rare. We were encouraged to dress in suits, to tone down our femininity, so that we appeared “serious.”We weren’t asked to be glamorous, but we were asked to be “deferential,” even “flirty,” to make sure the focus was always on empowering our male counterparts. Now, with the passing decades we are being asked to look “sexy and alluring.”I am not judging these young, smart women. They are doing what they must to survive in a business that has become all about surface and showy — be attractive so the station will get high ratings. By encouraging low necklines, long manes and heavy makeup for female anchors, they are creating new challenges for all of us, of all ages, who want to be judged by the same criteria used to judge a man in that position.Brainpower! Just recently, five female anchors at New York’s NY1 network sued for age and gender discrimination. The suit was settled for an undisclosed amount though probably not enough to dissuade other networks from pushing older women aside.I’ll close by sharing a recent exchange at the anchor desk. I was sitting next to a stunning young female co-anchor, who had just turned 30. She turned to me and said, “I guess I’d better start saving now for my face-lift.”I was smoldering inside, though I smiled, and simply said this: “I hope that by the time you are considering surgery things will have changed in this business to the point where you’ll be able to actually look whatever age you are. I hope you will be respected and valued for how good you are at your job, and not for how good and young you look.”","I recently turned 70.It has taken me more than four months simply to be able to write those four words. I’m not age-phobic. I know it’s a blessing that I’ve been around for seven decades. I know I should celebrate longevity and good health, like my mother does, a vibrant woman of 91 who does yoga.Yet a feeling of shame often arises when I remember I am actually the number 70. And I’m ashamed to admit that I feel shame. I wouldn’t feel this way if I were a doctor still practicing my profession at 70. I certainly wouldn’t feel this way if I were a 70-year-old athlete or author. Instead, I have been a news anchor in the same community for close to 40 years. Along with my reporting, I get paid to look my best. But even though our audience has watched me age, it’s a requirement that I somehow look ageless.I have not had plastic surgery. After too many elective surgeries for other medical reasons, I am not anxious to go under the knife again. Still, I spend precious hours each day doing every other thing imaginable to maintain the illusion of youth, using the best make-up products and, lately, applying false eyelashes.My blow-dryer, flat iron and hair spray are as essential as my computer. And my hair has been blond forever! I wear sexy clothes, not because I want to but because it is a job requirement for women, at every age.So what’s with the shame? Older male anchors get to be admired, despite their paunches and no hair and wrinkles. Women in showbiz are expected to fight it and get depressed by how our accumulation of birthdays changes our bodies. Friends my age talk about becoming invisible. I understand what they mean. Off the air, I, too, can feel like an older woman blending into the woodwork while the attention gravitates toward those who are half my age. On air, I am in a position where I can’t be overlooked. Profit margins depend on me being very visible, appearing eternally youthful.I am not young. I am 70. I am also very good at my job. When my big birthday was announced on the air … let’s just say not all the responses were “congratulations.” Yes, I get lots of support in my Facebook feed and even in letters from older women who see me as a role model, enduring the pressures of ageism in my profession and in our world.But there was also this ugly stream of other reactions, on email and social media: “You old hag! Just retire already.”“Will you just retire already and give some young woman a chance.”How do I know these messages come from men? Sometimes it’s easy to click on their Twitter profile. Sometimes they leave a first name. But as far as I know, no woman has ever sent me such sentiments.I know they’re just words, but words have power. They can crumble a wall of confidence built by years of praise and accomplishments. And words alluding to the uselessness of an “old woman” can send me into tears.I feel a stab in the stomach, a rush of anger.

",1/9/2020,4 Things I Want by the Time I Turn 90,"Two of my close friends, Anna and Eileen, are over the age of 90. The word “spunky” comes to mind long before “old” if asked to describe them. Clear of mind and physically agile, they have taught me valuable lessons on how to live long and live well, as have other indestructible role models inching toward nonagenarian status, from actress Judith Dench, 85 — who still wears a bikini — to Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 87, assessing oral arguments while battling cancer.Watching them thrive, here is my wish list of four things I want when I celebrate my 90th birthday — in 25 years!I want to be strong of body.When Jane Fonda launched her exercise videos in 1982, I yearned to look like her, and began doing her routines, in leotards and leg warmers. Since my 20s, I swim or walk most days and hope to be keeping it up until I drop. I am inspired by my close friend, Anna Greenberg, 91, who drives herself to the gym in her big Lincoln, to stretch and pump iron with a personal trainer.My husband’s grandmother, Mattie Anthony, died a month before she turned 105. The woman we called Granny believed that “muscles have memory,” that the fact she drove her body hard all her life kept her vital. As a young woman, she rode horseback through rough Maryland woods to the one-room schoolhouse where she taught grades one through seven for 20 years, before moving on to the local elementary school.After she retired from teaching at the age of 65, Granny kept “bending and pulling and weeding” in her garden and traveled the world, to every continent except Antarctica. “Had I just gone home and sat down on the couch and watched TV, I wouldn’t be here today,” Granny would say. “All of my life I have never stopped moving. The people I know who stopped moving aren’t around anymore.”I want to be strong of spirit and mind.While exercise strengthens our core muscles, I want my real core to be indestructible. By 90, we will have buried best friends and beloved family members, often including male partners, who statistically die several years earlier than women. Those who survive adversity have soul power, a will to carry on. They also stay engaged in work they love.Italian scientist Rita Levi-Montalcini was 77 when she and her research partner Stanley Cohen won the Nobel Prize for their discoveries in the field of neurology. At the age of 100, she still showed up for her job at the European Brain Institute, which she founded. In a 2009 interview with Richard Owen for theTimes of London, Levi-Montalcini, who died at 103, said a major contributor to her endurance was lifelong learning: “Always keep the brain active and interested.”Eileen Cohn will celebrate her 94th birthday this September. The advice of a Nobel laureate is also her ticket to longevity. Before the pandemic, Cohn was still working in her longtime profession, teaching children from kindergarten through fifth grade. She survived colon cancer, four heart valve replacements and pockets of loneliness, having lost her husband when she was only 54.“My career got me through everything,” says Cohn, who lives on her own. “I love teaching so I always had something that got me up in the morning.”Another secret for her successful aging: “I have a scotch every night.”I want to stay connected to loved ones.When gerontologists study the oldest seniors, whom they call “super-agers,” they point to three key arteries that fuel a long life: staying fit, staying mentally engaged and having close relationships.I want to always have open lines of communication, filled with love and respect, with our four sons. I want my marriage to stay grounded and growing until death do us part. I want to always have my long-held girlfriends, a far-flung circle spanning many states and many decades.These soul sisters are like family, borne not of blood but of history, love and loyalty. Several of my besties come from summer camp in the 1960s. They knew me in braces and braids. They keep me youthful as we rock the gray together, singing campfire songs we have sung for more than half a century. Turns out these communities of loved ones help us live longer.According to an extensive 2016 report from the Mayo Clinic, adults with strong social support have a reduced risk of many significant health problems, including depression, high blood pressure, and unhealthy habits, as we encourage each other to quit drinking or smoking, and to exercise more. Beyond the science, girlfriends offer a sweetness and solace not found anywhere else.I want to always look my best.Between the gym and great hairdressers, the women I hang around with gliding through their 90s dress with flair, wear bright lipstick and in Cohn’s case, apply false eyelashes daily: “I told my kids they better bury me in those lashes,” she says.Vanity is not superficial — it means self-love and a desire to always put our best face forward, reflective of a strong inner core. An unforgettable encounter I had a few years back was with Gladys Lipton, who began taking art lessons in her late 80s at her senior independent living facility. This fueled a passion for painting, and she had her first gallery show at the age of 91.Her deco-inspired work was bold and riveting, and so was the widowed Lipton. She was wearing a white caftan and her silver hair was swirled into a French twist. In a girlish banter, she shared she was now dating three men, all younger, and all very different, “to meet my diverse interests,” she explained. “One is for cuddling, one for the theater, and one for Scrabble.” It ain’t over until it’s over.","Two of my close friends, Anna and Eileen, are over the age of 90.

",11/1/2021,My Mom Died of Dementia  ,"When my mother felt her brain wasn’t as sharp as it used to be, I’d find crossword puzzles around her apartment, half finished. They didn’t help. She was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment and then, about two years later, dementia. A year later, gone. Atrophied brain, said her death certificate. But her love was as enormous as always. You should have seen her smile the last time I saw her, via FaceTime from a memory care unit at the very start of the pandemic quarantine.The magic of crosswords is just one of the myths that we really, really want to believe but end up being untrue, says Sanjay Gupta, M.D. You’ve seen him reporting on the coronavirus daily as CNN chief medical correspondent. Now, he’s written AARP’s newKeep Sharp: Build a Better Brain at Any Age. Here is the puzzle myth and other popular beliefs that he debunks.Myth: A crossword a day keeps the dementia doctor away.Fact: Oh, I wish. Doing crossword puzzles won’t keep your brain sharp in any general sense, Gupta says, since crossword puzzles flex only the part of your brain involved in finding words (also called fluency). Plus, if you’re a buff, they’re just plain fun.Myth: There’s a pill for that.Fact: Tragically for my parents, there’s no pill to cure dementia (not yet, anyway — please put that on your wish list!). My mom and my dad, who five years ago died with mind-robbing Alzheimer’s, both took Aricept, often prescribed for dementia. These types of medications don’t slow the rate of cognitive decline, confirms Gupta, although they might help with symptoms like memory loss and confusion for anywhere from a few months to a year. As with many patients, my parents saw no improvement. Ditto those supplements? Yep. I found boxes of them stashed in Dad’s study after he died. My heart just broke — he, always so in control, must have been so scared! In fact, more than a quarter of adults in the United States age 50 and older take at least one supplement for brain-health reasons, Gupta reports. But the vast majority of people who buy them are throwing away their money. (The small percentage of people who are helped have detectable deficiencies that the supplement treats.)Myth: We’re all bound to lose our minds with age.Fact:Some cognitive skills do decline as you age, especially if you don’t employ strategies to pay closer attention and help you remember. But while you may have been quicker at picking up a new language or memorizing a list of random words when you were younger, Gupta says you’re more likely to be superior with vocabulary and a good judge of character when you’re older. You’d score higher on tests of social communication and diplomacy, such as how to settle an argument or deal with a conflict. The other good news about aging is that we tend to improve over time at controlling our own emotions (I’m still waiting), weathering stress (ditto) and finding meaning in our lives (well, one out of three ain’t bad).Gupta’s overriding message: Dementia is not a normal part of aging. Typical age-related changes in the brain are not the same as changes that are caused by disease. The former can be slowed down and the latter can be avoided.

",22-03-2021,Meet Iris Krasnow: The Ethel’s New Senior Editor,"I am thrilled to introduce myself as the new senior editor ofThe Ethel,a post created by Shelley Emling, executive editor of specialized content, which includes this newsletter,The Girlfriend,and others. Thank you, Shelley, for tapping me for my dream job!I am 66, the mother of four sons — ages 31, 29 and 27-year-old twins — and we live in Annapolis, Maryland. I have a little bit of arthritis and a lot of gray hair. No grandchildren yet; just one gorgeous grand-dog, an Australian sheltie.My husband and I have been married for 33 years and have rocked and rolled through the passing of all four of our parents, raising four feisty teenagers at once and feeling the sting of an empty nest — and we managed to stay together, with grit, tenacity, endurance and love.For me, a martini every night, infused with a juicy blue cheese olive, has also helped.This appointment toThe Etheleditorial team comes after four decades as a journalist who has written seven books on a woman’s most important relationships that mirror the passages of our lives. The categoriesThe Ethel(geared toward “women who weren’t born yesterday”) is devoted to — love and loss, finance, sexuality, health and ageism — are passages in which I have deep and varied experiences, as chronicled in my books, some of them best sellers.First cameSurrendering to Motherhood,published in 1997, followed bySurrendering to Marriage(2002),Surrendering to Yourself(2003),I Am My Mother’s Daughter(2007), The Secret Lives of Wives(2011)and Sex After… Women Share How Intimacy Changes as Life Changes(2014).My latest book, published in April 2020 and coming out in paperback next month, isCamp Girls: Fireside Lessons on Friendship, Courage, and Loyalty.I was born and raised in Oak Park, Illinois, and am a graduate of Stanford University, with a master’s degree from Georgetown University. My early journalism career was spent as the fashion writer at theDallas Times Herald. I then moved to Washington, D.C., to become the national feature writer for United Press International.As a young journalist at UPI, I had the opportunity to profile many formidable women who taught me early on that success and self-worth had little to do with age and everything to do with passion and a sustained sense of purpose. That list includes Yoko Ono, Barbara Bush, Erica Jong, Ginger Rogers, Betty Friedan, Annie Leibovitz and Queen Noor of Jordan.As women in their 90s are among the fastest-growing segment of the aging population, these lessons align with the goal ofThe Ethel:to shatter ageist stereotypes and empower readers to believe that anything is possible at every stage.We all know 94-year-olds who have more energy than some of our college-age kids.Camp Girlsis proof that anything is possible at any age, a book that chronicles my return to work at the summer camp of my girlhood.  I left Camp Agawak, in the northern woods of Wisconsin, as an 18-year-old counselor in 1973, skipped a few decades and then came back as a 59-year-old in 2013 to start a writing program.I am the oldest counselor, though I am ageless as I hike the tangled and towering woods of pine and swim the icy lake with campers a sixth of my age.We hopeThe Ethelcommunity on Facebook, which you can join atfacebook.com/aarpethel/timeline, as well as our newsletter, will also inspire you to resurrect old passions and hobbies that were shelved while you were busy raising families or climbing the career ladder and being everything to everybody else — something women too often do.It is time for YOU!The Ethelis here to lift you in work and play and in relationships, and to jump-start new adventures and old dreams. Success in those crucial arteries of life comes down to believing in ourselves, at 50 and 70 and beyond, in the spirit of Ethel Percy Andrus, our namesake, who founded AARP at the age of 74 in 1958.When I imagine the potential and possibilities available to “women who weren’t born yesterday,” I think of this stanza from the song “Landslide,” first performed by Fleetwood Mac then further popularized by the Dixie Chicks:Can the child within my heart rise above? / Can I sail through the changin’ ocean tides? / Can I handle the seasons of my life? / Well, I’ve been afraid of changin’ / ‘Cause I've built my life around you / But time makes you bolder / Even children get older / And I'm getting older, too.And what I have come to know through my own journey through the stages of womanhood is that we can handle every change, every loss and every season of our lives if we learn, right now, that we need to handle our own fulfillment and happiness.","I am thrilled to introduce myself as the new senior editor ofThe Ethel,a post created by Shelley Emling, executive editor of specialized content, which includes this newsletter,The Girlfriend,and others.

Success in those crucial arteries of life comes down to believing in ourselves, at 50 and 70 and beyond, in the spirit of Ethel Percy Andrus, our namesake, who founded AARP at the age of 74 in 1958.When I imagine the potential and possibilities available to “women who weren’t born yesterday,” I think of this stanza from the song “Landslide,” first performed by Fleetwood Mac then further popularized by the Dixie Chicks:Can the child within my heart rise above? / Can I sail through the changin’ ocean tides? / Can I handle the seasons of my life? / Well, I’ve been afraid of changin’ / ‘Cause I've built my life around you / But time makes you bolder / Even children get older / And I'm getting older, too.And what I have come to know through my own journey through the stages of womanhood is that we can handle every change, every loss and every season of our lives if we learn, right now, that we need to handle our own fulfillment and happiness."

And I was very loyal to it.I started experimenting with my naturally medium brown locks in high school. I’d go from black to auburn to brown, and back again. But by the time I hit my 30s, things got more serious. I found myself scrambling to cover up the scattered silver strands that my friends called my “tinsel.”I’m not a fan of tinsel on Christmas trees and I was even less thrilled about having it on my head. I wasn’t ready to accept the changes happening to my body due to aging. With an arsenal of little plastic bottles and a mountain of disposable gloves, I was ready to fight to hold on to what I perceived to be my youth and vitality.For the next two decades, I hid my emerging white roots like a dark secret, resorting to hats and headscarves on those rare occasions when I was unable to visit a salon or a drugstore hair color aisle. I used temporary sprays, powders and pastes that left my hair feeling as stiff as a discarded bird nest. I longed to be free from my beauty product bondage. But I was stuck.What was I so afraid of?Now in my early 50s, I look back and see that I was terrified of what other people would think of me if I let my true color show. How would society label me? Was I just one missed salon appointment away from becoming an “old lady”?Thanks to genetics, I always had a reasonably youthful appearance and could get away with passing for a decade younger than my age. I didn’t mind revealing my real age because I could rely on getting those predictable compliments like, “You don’t look a day over 40.”Part of me was proud of my years, my achievements, my wisdom and the more self-assured person I’d become. I’d raised a daughter, conquered insecurity, completed two master's  degrees and even spent a year learning Brazilian jujitsu. I knew these were things that only life experience and maturity could have afforded me.I went all age-positive and celebrated my 50th birthday by writing an article for Thrive Global called “I’m Turning 50, and I Want to Tell Everyone.”But letting my hair go white was another story. I refused to do it — until something strange happened.I was on COVID-19 lockdown at home, all by myself. I brewed some cinnamon apple tea, popped a bowl of popcorn and sat down to watchThe Lord of The Rings: The Two Towers.There’s a scene in the movie where the wizard Gandalf the Grey appears in the forest in a shroud of blinding light. He dramatically reveals himself as Gandalf the White, now wearing snow-colored robes with shocking white hair.After he bravely defeated and killed the menacing, fire-breathing creature called the Balrog, Gandalf experienced a rite of passage. He was reborn, transformed into a more powerful white wizard. In fact, he’d moved up the hierarchy of wizards, from grey to white. Gandalf was sporting all white hair and at his full power.I decided right then. I was going to stop being afraid. Instead of using Dark Brown Number 47, I was going to have my own natural hair color. If I had to give it a name, I’d call it “White as Truth.”There would be no more hiding, no more spraying, powdering and dyeing. There would be no more denying who I really am.If I allowed myself to show up in the world as bravely and valiantly as Gandalf did, I would defeat the menacing creature that is my fear and shame about my age.

If you like working alone and don't want to share till you feel done, you might not enjoy this openness. Pride of ownership, and control of process or outcome, don't win you any points. The advantage of collaboration is that you can accumulate buy-in along the way, not to mention get insights from people with expertise you don't have.

",1/11/2021,The New Retirement: How Golden Girls are Redefining the Golden Years,"The golden years are getting a makeover. Old-school thinking about retirement is being called out, in many cases led by women who are challenging the status quo. We’re the same women who broke glass ceilings and forged new definitions of work-family balance and partnership. We’re the same women creating new role models as business owners and leaders proving age is not a limiting factor.We’re the same women who will redefine retirement. As we consider what this looks like, let’s consider what we bring to the table:· Tenacity, resilience and leadership.· With technology, access to a global stage.· Recognition of our continued need to advocate for ourselves.We are all Wonder Woman — the 1984 superheroine who has battled on behalf of our families, communities and gender. We’re taking care of our aging parents, adult children and grandchildren while considering what the next phase of our lives looks like. In many respects, we’re at the same place we’ve always been, faced with accepting the status quo or changing it.Here are few ways we can rethink and redo our golden years, so they continue to shine.Create a Vision That Challenges AssumptionsAgeism is real. It is the practice of discrimination or stereotyping on the basis of age starting with ourselves. We joke about when we’ll end up in an old folks’ home, though in these changing times, likely we will not, as noted by Ashton Applewhite, author ofThis Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism.As Applewhite writes: “People are happiest at the beginnings and the ends of their lives. Only 2.5% of Americans over 65 live in nursing homes. Older people enjoy better mental health than the young or middle-aged. So how come so many of us unthinkingly assume that depression, diapers, and dementia lie ahead?”So, a first step toward creating a new retirement might be to check on our own prejudice around getting older. What stories are we telling ourselves and why are we buying into them? What game-changing action might we take if there was no script for getting older?Leverage Our Skills and ExperienceYou don’t have to go far before running into an older woman getting an advanced degree, starting her own business or making plans to live in another country. We’re stepping forward as corporate refugees and empty nesters with more time to focus on ourselves. We’re taking our skills, wisdom and networks and creating new work opportunities based on our previous experience and changing family structures and our changing expectations:· Maybe after leaving work to spend years at home raising children, we have ideas on how to rise up again with a start-up business.· Maybe we’re discovering how capable we feel on our own after years in a corporate culture that beat us down· Maybe we’re finding inspiration from stellar role models for our own stellar second or third acts.Diana Nyad, at the age of 64, was the first person to make the swim — on her fifth try — from Cuba to Florida. It took her 53 hours, in what she called “inky black” waters. Patricia Forehand from Perry, Georgia, became a comedian after retiring from teaching for 32 years. Suzanne Watson, now 57 from Cincinnati, went back to medical school at 50 after her husband passed away and she needed to make more money.At 63, I left a full-time job running leadership programs for senior government executives to focus full-time on money-mindset coaching, digital course development and engaging facilitation. It’s been rewarding to show up in communities of entrepreneurs of all ages offering insights into business strategy, technology and design.Whenever one of my own children say: “Mom, are you having fun?” I check in with my joy meter and realize this isreallyfun!Love Our MoneyThe National Institute for Retirement Security (NIRS) reported in May 2020 that women remain at a disadvantage when it comes to retirement savings. Notable reasons included being paid roughly 80 cents on the dollar throughout their careers compared to men, not able to earn as much due to caregiving responsibilities (thereby affecting Social Security income), and divorce having an outsize impact on women’s overall assets.On top of the practical reasons for financial gaps, we may lack confidence or have anxiety about managing our money. We consult with our husbands or fathers for advice even when we know what to do. We avoid meeting with a financial planner for fear of facing tough decisions. We learned in our early life that talking about money was taboo, or that it created conflict. Financial education wasn’t a priority, and the growth of easy access to debt has left too many of us living beyond our means. The fact is, we can take actions today that can make a difference, even if it’s just in how we relate to money.· We can consider how love for our money might show up differently than discomfort or fear around it.· We can imagine our older, wiser selves looking back on us wishing we had lived and spent differently.· We can ask ourselves where or what makes us happy and how money can play a better role paired with those values. In the end, what retirement looks, feels or sounds like is up to us. We have an open road now due to women-led cultural changes, even if the road we’ve been traveling has been bumpy and filled with pit stops. If anyone should be in the driver’s seat, it’s us.","The golden years are getting a makeover. Old-school thinking about retirement is being called out, in many cases led by women who are challenging the status quo. We’re the same women who broke glass ceilings and forged new definitions of work-family balance and partnership. We’re the same women creating new role models as business owners and leaders proving age is not a limiting factor.We’re the same women who will redefine retirement. As we consider what this looks like, let’s consider what we bring to the table:· Tenacity, resilience and leadership.· With technology, access to a global stage.· Recognition of our continued need to advocate for ourselves.We are all Wonder Woman — the 1984 superheroine who has battled on behalf of our families, communities and gender. We’re taking care of our aging parents, adult children and grandchildren while considering what the next phase of our lives looks like. In many respects, we’re at the same place we’ve always been, faced with accepting the status quo or changing it.Here are few ways we can rethink and redo our golden years, so they continue to shine.Create a Vision That Challenges AssumptionsAgeism is real. It is the practice of discrimination or stereotyping on the basis of age starting with ourselves. We joke about when we’ll end up in an old folks’ home, though in these changing times, likely we will not, as noted by Ashton Applewhite, author ofThis Chair Rocks: A Manifesto Against Ageism.As Applewhite writes: “People are happiest at the beginnings and the ends of their lives. Only 2.5% of Americans over 65 live in nursing homes. Older people enjoy better mental health than the young or middle-aged. So how come so many of us unthinkingly assume that depression, diapers, and dementia lie ahead?”So, a first step toward creating a new retirement might be to check on our own prejudice around getting older. What stories are we telling ourselves and why are we buying into them? What game-changing action might we take if there was no script for getting older?Leverage Our Skills and ExperienceYou don’t have to go far before running into an older woman getting an advanced degree, starting her own business or making plans to live in another country. We’re stepping forward as corporate refugees and empty nesters with more time to focus on ourselves. We’re taking our skills, wisdom and networks and creating new work opportunities based on our previous experience and changing family structures and our changing expectations:· Maybe after leaving work to spend years at home raising children, we have ideas on how to rise up again with a start-up business.· Maybe we’re discovering how capable we feel on our own after years in a corporate culture that beat us down· Maybe we’re finding inspiration from stellar role models for our own stellar second or third acts.Diana Nyad, at the age of 64, was the first person to make the swim — on her fifth try — from Cuba to Florida. It took her 53 hours, in what she called “inky black” waters. Patricia Forehand from Perry, Georgia, became a comedian after retiring from teaching for 32 years. Suzanne Watson, now 57 from Cincinnati, went back to medical school at 50 after her husband passed away and she needed to make more money.At 63, I left a full-time job running leadership programs for senior government executives to focus full-time on money-mindset coaching, digital course development and engaging facilitation. It’s been rewarding to show up in communities of entrepreneurs of all ages offering insights into business strategy, technology and design.Whenever one of my own children say: “Mom, are you having fun?” I check in with my joy meter and realize this isreallyfun!Love Our MoneyThe National Institute for Retirement Security (NIRS) reported in May 2020 that women remain at a disadvantage when it comes to retirement savings. Notable reasons included being paid roughly 80 cents on the dollar throughout their careers compared to men, not able to earn as much due to caregiving responsibilities (thereby affecting Social Security income), and divorce having an outsize impact on women’s overall assets.On top of the practical reasons for financial gaps, we may lack confidence or have anxiety about managing our money. We consult with our husbands or fathers for advice even when we know what to do. We avoid meeting with a financial planner for fear of facing tough decisions. We learned in our early life that talking about money was taboo, or that it created conflict. Financial education wasn’t a priority, and the growth of easy access to debt has left too many of us living beyond our means. The fact is, we can take actions today that can make a difference, even if it’s just in how we relate to money.· We can consider how love for our money might show up differently than discomfort or fear around it.· We can imagine our older, wiser selves looking back on us wishing we had lived and spent differently.· We can ask ourselves where or what makes us happy and how money can play a better role paired with those values.

Why Long-Term Care Insurance Is Key,"For even more information on how to make an informed decision,go here.Leading parallel lives living as young married women with corporate careers and earning MBAs, we became new moms and part of the “sandwich generation.” This profile was not just a description of multigenerational caregiving but dictated a weight of responsibility.Our parallel lives soon included widowed mothers: Natalie’s mom with a Parkinson’s diagnosis and without the ability to purchase long-term care (LTC) insurance; and Rona’s, who was able to secure a valuable LTC insurance policy and protect her daughter from becoming a caregiver.Translation: Rona’s mom would have private, tax-free money to provide for extended care, enabling her to remain in her new apartment as a widow without burdening her family, while Natalie’s had no protection. Without private insurance, choices would be limited and resources scarce. The burden fell on Natalie — financially and emotionally.Natalie’s mother needed care for upward of eight years. She moved to an apartment where a home health aide could sleep. She went to an assisted living facility. When the facility could no longer care for her, the burden was on Natalie to hire around-the-clock private aides rather than put her mom in a subpar Medicaid facility. Ultimately, the last 10 months of her life were spent in a nursing home on Medicaid, after a lifetime of savings had evaporated.Natalie was responsible for her mom’s care despite the competing financial needs of her own family. Besides the emotional toll Natalie felt, the costs were staggering and each level of care demanded greater resources. If her mom had purchased a LTC insurance policy when she was healthy, her plan of care would have been to remain home and in the community.Appreciating the differences of experiences, we founded New York-based Karp Loshak LTC Insurance Brokerage Solutions over a decade ago to focus on the critical need to plan. Our style and our platform remain educational, independent and consultative. Here are six ideas worth considering given the consequences of extended care and the myriad solutions available in the LTC insurance marketplace.We are living longer!Ages 90 and 100 are becoming familiar milestones. Due to living longer, there is a greater need for long-term care compared with previous generations. Medicare will not cover these expenses. Longevity demands that we think differently. How do we maintain our lifestyle and independence without burdening our children or spouses? As women age, we are more likely to live alone, develop chronic conditions and get Alzheimer’s.Family dynamicsExtended care is a family issue. Caregiving results in difficult decisions and causes family conflicts. What should be liquidated to pay for care? Where and how will care be provided? Spouses may be older and frail. Adult children may not live nearby and have careers and families. Blended families have even more complexity, where “everyone” and “no one” is in charge.The financial consequences of care can be devastating to lifestyle and legacy, as well as compromise family dynamics. LTC insurance provides a private pool of dollars that pays for care, which allows for more choice and control. Relationships are preserved.Solo agingThere may be no spouse or children to care for us. This growing population known as “solo agers,” or “elder orphans,” represents a mounting cohort. One in 5 baby boomers have no children, and one-third of adults will enter old age single (widowed, divorced or never married). Health, caregiving and safety concerns are further magnified for those who do not have a support system. LTC insurance carriers have care coordination services that can help manage care needs if requested.Women: Use your financial muscleWomen are usually the drivers of the LTC conversation. If you have been traditionally absent from the financial table, LTC insurance planning is an ideal place to start. If there is a spouse who is uninsurable, women must take the financial reigns. Women need to plan for themselves, as assets will be redirected toward the uninsurable spouse, thus jeopardizing financial security, or worse, leaving them impoverished.Do you have a “moat” to protect your income stream?Your lifestyle is supported by an income stream. If you want to stay in a home environment or an assisted living facility, an LTC policy will provide you a separate income stream of tax-free money each month and protect your “sandcastle.” Without it, spending money for extended care can severely compromise your lifestyle and retirement portfolio.You are never as young as you are today: Capture that good health!Younger and healthier is the best time to plan for long-term care. Capture good health, current age and marital status for best pricing and options. The cost to waiting is that you risk becoming uninsurable. Long-term care insurance should be part of every woman’s plan to protect lifestyle, family and independence. Consumers are best served when able to review a comprehensive set of solutions given their age, health, budget, lifestyle, marital status and state residence. All carriers and plan designs should be considered when navigating the LTC insurance landscape for a successful outcome and planning experience.

",14-02-2022,The Makeup Products and Tools That No Older Woman Should Be Without,"In my 18 years as an aesthetician and makeup artist, most of my clients have been 50 and older. When they come into my studio, Pretty Parlor, for a makeover before a wedding or special party, I tell them I can’t promise them the fountain of youth. I can promise, however, to introduce them to makeup secrets that will help them look their best at every age and stage — way beyond that one celebratory night.With the beauty industry constantly changing, staying in the know of the latest brands and trends is crucial for me. Here, I will share some of the best makeup products and application tools that are must-haves for mature women.Every woman from college age onward should already be practicing a good skin regimen. This should consist of a cleanser, exfoliant, treatment serum, eye cream and moisturizer tailored to your skin's needs. It is important to start with a fresh canvas — a clean face.I always recommend applying eye makeup first, prior to any foundation or blush. The reasoning behind this is that any residual eye shadow that falls off the brush can be wiped off without ruining the foundation that has already been applied. Which leads me to the first game-changing makeup tip: Get yourself some under-eye gel patches to apply before the eye shadow and eyeliner. Not only do these patches rejuvenate the under-eye area, but they also serve as a catchall from any shadow you apply.There’s an overwhelming array of gel patches on the market, and when choosing, make sure the patches contain hyaluronic acid — and it’s a plus for them also to contain caffeine. My personal favorite is Borboleta’s Cool Down Eye Mask. (For an extra cooling and depuffing effect, store eye patches in the refrigerator.)The eye area is fragile at every age, so as the years mount, make sure your products are not causing irritation and damage. Which leads me right into must-have number 2 — a gel eyeliner that is easily applied to your upper and lower eyelids.The newest eyeliners are no longer those dry, scratchy pencils. Today’s best ones, liquids and gels, glide on without damaging the skin. You want to go for the cream eyeliners are gels, that are kind to the delicate skin surrounding the eyes. My go-to recommendation is the smudge-proof Xtreme Lashes Glideliner Long Lasting Eye Pencil. This gel pencil liner does exactly as it is named; It glides into perfect lines! If you are looking for a less expensive gel pencil, Neutrogena Intense Gel Liner or NYX Professional Makeup Slide On Waterproof Pencil Eye Liner are both super-gliders too.Next up is a good makeup primer that works in multiple ways: It helps with making your foundation last, mutes the appearance of fine lines and evens out skin imperfections. My go-to in that category is Image Skincare I Prime Flawless Blur Gel, packed with skin-soothing botanicals and antioxidants.I recommend applying the primer with Image Skincare Flawless Foundation Brush. This versatile tool can also be used to apply foundation and your serums of choice. The bristles are thick and flexible, easily dipping into — and covering — every dip and contour of your face. My clients come away with a face that is a smooth and even canvas. If you are looking to save a few dollars on application brushes, Real Techniques and e.l.f Cosmetics are also great alternatives!My next must-have when I do makeovers is a creamy concealer. You want to stay away from brands that leave a caked-on effect.  My preferred one is Xtreme Lashes Skin Renewing Concealer. I am a big fan of this waterproof concealer because it camouflages under-eye dark circles and also primes the upper-eye primer for your eye shadow. Other great anti-aging concealers include It Cosmetics Bye Bye Undereye Anti-Aging Concealer and Maybelline Superstay Better Skin Concealer + Corrector.Finally, adding to the creamy concealer comes my pick for a companion foundation. And please remember that with these products, less is more.  Multiple layers of foundation and concealer packed in those fine lines only draws more attention to what you’re trying to hide.Hands down, I put this brand as one of my top choices — Image Flawless Foundation. It is the perfect consistency for an airbrushed-look coverage and never leaves you with a caked-on face. While smoothing out patches of imperfection, the ingredients are nourishing and include a mineral-based SPF 30 protector. My clients also tell me good things about the less expensive,  uber-creamy Covergirl + Olay Simply Ageless 3-in-1 Liquid Foundation, as well as Revlon Age Defying 3X Foundation.OK, those are some of the beauty products and tools always in my bag of tricks. You will be thoroughly surprised at the difference they make when you take that final look in the mirror before you confidently step out the door.","In my 18 years as an aesthetician and makeup artist, most of my clients have been 50 and older.

",13-07-2020,Retiring With Kids Still at Home?,"When I met my husband, Mark, in 2005, I ran equations. I was 31, he was 43: a Gen X/boomer romance. When I was 38, he'd be 50. 53/65. 68/80. Twelve years felt like an enormous gap when we met. By the time we married a year later, it wasn't such a big deal.When we started having kids (35/47), I joked with friends that we were on a fast track to babiesbecause we were old. When our third and youngest was born (39/51), I noted that when he graduated from high school, Mark would be 70. Often, if someone saw Mark alone, wrangling three kids in a restaurant or store or on a ski trail, they would congratulate him: “Good job, grandpa!” The fact that he was prematurely gray didn't help matters. He started answering, “I'm the great-grandpa!”These days, our kids are 9, 7, 5; we are 45/57. Mark doesn't get the grandpa cheers anymore — probably because he's so clearly Daddy. But lately, some new equations have entered our pillow talk. This sequence in particular: 67/55/20/18/16.If Mark wants to retire around 67, we're going to have one kid in college (probably), one kid about to go to college and one kid still living at home. The avalanche of late-midlife financial questions has started pouring down. Retirement? Kids’ education?Later life health care costs? Mortgage? And and and?Having kids later in life definitely has had its advantages — we're wiser, we've done a whole lot of stuff in our youth — but on the flip side, time and energy are running out. How do we manage all that still has to be managed and do right by our kids’ future, and right by our own financial and physical well-being?Here are four key areas to consider.1. Retirement vs. collegeTwo epic investments loom over our heads: retirement and our kids’ education.Amber Miller, senior financial planner at the Planning Center in Minneapolis, points out that, contrary to the popular misconception, expenses don't go down in retirement; they just change. And you can't take out a loan for retirement. “There are loans for mortgages, loans for college, but if we're not focusing first for retirement, we'll never get there,” she says. The retirement/college conundrum is always going to be complex, since the future cost of education is full of unknowns. More often, Miller sees clients who ask their kids to foot some of the bill: “The older idea is that parents just pay for college, but now parents are teaching their kids to have some skin in the game.""This is the philosophy of Kari Brych (49) and her husband, Jim (54), who have two kids, ages 8 and 6. They started saving for their kids’ college education in the first year following adoption, but they aren't overly concerned aboutpaying for college. They both paid for their own education (they work in health care), and while they'll help their kids with the costs, “I'm not sure we'll foot the complete bill,” Brych says. “We want them to have some sense of ownership and work ethic instead of entitlement, and to find that balance.” They've prioritized funding their retirement, which they'll accomplish by having worked more hours before having kids, and living within their means.Our own financial adviser told us the same thing: There's a deadline to save for retirement, and it's coming. Best to save as much as we can now.2. Invite everybody to the discussionFor some, money is intensely private, a matter not to be discussed with anyone. But because money is emotional and personal, Miller says, talking about it with our kids can be a great opportunity to teach about what is valuable to us as people and as a family. Sharing with them what choices we're making and why — in age-appropriate ways — can mentor fiscal responsibility. She works with clients who invite their minor-aged children to some financial conversations. “The more we can have cross-generational conversations, the more satisfying results we'll have,” she says. And another bonus: She's seen 16-year-old kids who just started their first IRA to go with their first job.3. Health insurance costsThere'shealth insuranceto consider — for us and for our kids. The 50s are the prime decade to purchase long-term care insurance; before that age, we're paying premiums for too long, and after the 50s, it gets prohibitively expensive to buy. This is another conversation to add to the pillow talk: Do we have the resources to pay for growing health care costs? “Not like this is a solution for everyone,” Miller says, but it's a question to consider.Health insurance can also play a role in how long we continue to work, especially if we have kids to cover. “We see ourselves working past retirement in some capacity,” says Brych, “if only for health care insurance.” Because she and her husband both work in the medical field, they can work reduced hours and still get benefits. “If that continues, one of us will consider doing it, since we'll have young kids and we'll want to have it.”4. Taking care of ourselves — nowAnd then there's the present moment to consider.Five years ago as I sat on the couch nursing an infant, with a 4-year-old and a 2-year-old racing around us, I could literally feel my muscle mass disappearing. I was 40, and I knew I'd have to start strength training along with the running and other cardio I had been doing since my 20s. Mark and I want to be able to keep up with our kids, and their energy level inspires us to stay on our game.“One of our big concerns is staying healthy,” says Brych. “For both of us, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is paramount. Some things we can't change, like genetics. But some things we can mitigate so we age in a healthy fashion.” They stay active by biking, skiing and hiking, individually and together as a family. “I owe it to my children to do that,” she says. “They didn't choose to be adopted by old parents.""","When I met my husband, Mark, in 2005, I ran equations. I was 31, he was 43: a Gen X/boomer romance. When I was 38, he'd be 50. 53/65. 68/80. Twelve years felt like an enormous gap when we met. By the time we married a year later, it wasn't such a big deal.When we started having kids (35/47), I joked with friends that we were on a fast track to babiesbecause we were old. When our third and youngest was born (39/51), I noted that when he graduated from high school, Mark would be 70. Often, if someone saw Mark alone, wrangling three kids in a restaurant or store or on a ski trail, they would congratulate him: “Good job, grandpa!” The fact that he was prematurely gray didn't help matters. He started answering, “I'm the great-grandpa!”These days, our kids are 9, 7, 5; we are 45/57. Mark doesn't get the grandpa cheers anymore — probably because he's so clearly Daddy. But lately, some new equations have entered our pillow talk.

",10/5/2021,I Have Purple Hair and Tattoos and Am Darn Proud of It,"I am 61. I have four children and two grandchildren. I also have purple hair and seven tattoos. I never imagined that this was something I would do. I grew up in a strict Christian household where this type of self-expression was shunned and forbidden. But today, my neon hair and tattoos say as much about my individuality as they do about me — adamant about fighting ageism and stereotypes that only young people can be rebels.During my college years, I happily joined the women in the punk rock scene who had wild hair colors. That same color craze has made a resurgence, and it's not just for our kids and grandkids. Plenty of women in their menopausal years are dying their hair vibrant shades of green, blue, purple and pink. And I say it's about time!When my youngest daughter started coloring her hair in rainbow shades, I wistfully remembered the bright red streaks that glittered in my own hair under the disco ball. At fifty-one, I was quietly slipping into invisibility like so many other women my age. I didn't dare go against the societal norm or against my family. My parents had ingrained in me to be proper and to never do anything wild or outlandish that might, in their opinion, be frowned upon by God. Here I was a grown woman, yet I still craved my parents' approval.But when my father suddenly passed away, I felt the restraints loosening a bit. My mother had more significant health issues to deal with and became more relaxed. After spotting an older woman with black and white layered hair at the grocery store checkout lane, I marveled at her ability to pull it off so effortlessly. She looked sassy, vibrant. And I realized how desperately I wanted to feel that way about myself. I took the plunge and colored my hair in multiple layers of white, fuchsia and eggplant purple. What surprised me most about the change was the utter freedom I felt and the number of compliments I received from young and old women. When my mother playfully tugged a lock of my hair and said the colors suited me, I felt a new level of confidence that had been missing for years.Shortly after the hair changes, I met a woman in her 70s who had just gotten her first tattoo. The butterfly on her chest marked her first anniversary of beating breast cancer, and I was in awe of her bravery. She was very proud of her tattoo, and I wondered what it would be like to have something so meaningful inked on my own skin. I'd never considered it before since I was raised to believe that tattoos were for tough guys and motorcycle mamas. But that didn't stop me from getting one on my 56th birthday.The tattoo I chose was an image of a crane, a symbolic bird of the love I had for a sister who had died years earlier from pneumonia. I had no regrets about the tattoo, but I did worry about family backlash, so I wore jeans to cover the beautiful crane on my leg.When my mother passed away six months later, the jeans came off and I no longer cared what anyone else thought of me. Revealing the tattoo was emancipating and healing, allowing me to bust out of my strict upbringing and shatter age stereotypes. And I wanted more. I began to realize that tattoos were no longer a sign of one's societal standing or age.A recent Ipsos poll found that nearly one-third of all Americans have at least one tattoo, with 16 percent of those representing people over the age of 55. Body art may be a growing trend but it certainly is nothing new. People have been painting their skin for centuries, abiding by ceremonial and cultural traditions. Tattoos were found on Europe's oldest mummy, Otzi the Iceman, who lived sometime between 5,100 to 5,400 years ago.Meghan Schader, a tattoo artist at Badfellow in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, reports that she has seen a rise in older clients, particularly women 60 and beyond. “I get lots of grandparents that come in. My oldest client is my dad, and he's 85! I also tattoo a woman who is in her late 70s. Women have finally gotten to the point where we can express ourselves in ways that were frowned upon for so long, but now it's 2021. And we can finally live our truth.”I've been getting inked for five years now, and every tattoo holds a special meaning. But my favorite remains a line of birds soaring across my arm in memory of the sister who died too young. It's also my two-year-old granddaughter's favorite tattoo. When I hold her on my lap, she traces the birds and says, ""Nonnie's birdies!"" with a smile that melts me.","I am 61. I have four children and two grandchildren.

43,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/six-things-every-woman-over-60-needs-to-know-about-sex
",9/8/2021,Six Things Every Woman Over 60 Needs to Know About Sex,"I’ve been writing and researching sex and relationships for over 30 years and helped numerous couples get their sex lives back on track.What I wasn’t prepared for was just how much sex changes in the second part of you life. Happily, it’s often for the better. Here are six important things to remember as we navigate our relationships through life — that apply to every age.It’s OK not to want it — or have it.Sex stops in relationships for many reasons. For some women, a natural decline in their sex drive, combined with painful post-menopausal sex, makes them perfectly happy to wave it farewell.Others aren’t good at telling their partners what works for them, so they’ve put up with years of ineffectual technique. Or you’re bored: You’ve done it thousands of times already and simply lost interest. No wonder Netflix is more appealing. It changes its content constantly, which is more than you can say about the average couple’s sex routine!But think long and hard before you do decide to give up on sex — the physical and emotional benefits are tremendous. But there are ways to negotiate a sexless relationship and live happily ever after.Attitude is more important than aging.Research has shown conclusively that if youwantto have a happy sex life, this trumps menopause, hormones and aging every time. There are solutions for most problems, you just have to want to look for them. In other words, if you want to have great sex until you’re 90, you will.I interviewed hundreds of women for my book,Great Sex Starts at 50, and they divided sharply into two camps. Women who embraced the second part of their lives felt desirable and sexy (even if their breasts did sag), reported highly satisfying sex lives and overcame nearly all of the challenges thrown up by aging or menopause.The women who focused on their stretch marks and “fat” tummies and saw themselves as “dried up old women” — no surprise here — either weren’t having sex or having unsatisfactory sex and experiencing low enjoyment of life in general.When shame walks in the door, it’s not just lust that goes out the window.You’re probably not with the wrong person if you don’t want to have sex with your partner anymore.All relationships move into friendship long term because what fuels love (security, contentment, predictability) kills desire (which wants anxiety, the forbidden, erotic edge). Most couples sensibly opt for love over sex, simply because even the lustiest of us don’t have sex all the time.Realizing this is normal is the first step to reclaiming desire for your partner. Next, have an honest discussion about what still works for both of you sexually and what doesn’t. Develop fantasies and stop worrying about who stars in them. If you don’t fancy your partner but sure as hell do your boss, run a hot fantasy about that person through your head when you’re next having sex.Your partner can’t read your mind and it works in their favor in the end. If that fantasy makes you enjoy sex more with them, your brain associates good sex with your partner, making you more open to doing it in the future.Sex isn’t just intercourse.Lots of older women find penetrative sex painful. Lots of older men can’t achieve an erection, and not all can or want to take Viagra. The reason why lots of women over 60 report highly satisfying sex is because sex moves away from intercourse and becomes more focused on foreplay. This is a great thing for most women.Foreplay isn’t something you do before sex, itissex.If you can’t talk about sex after 60, you’ll probably stop having it.While researching the book, I met an extraordinary number of couples who’d quietly stopped having sex and never had a conversation about it with their partner. Even if you both decide this decision works for you, you must have the conversation. If you don’t, you’ll stop being affectionate for fear of it being interpreted as initiating sex. A relationship can survive without sex but not without affection.Most women start avoiding sex after 60 because it’s painful. Most men avoid sex after 60 because their penises don’t work like they did, and they’re embarrassed to admit it. If you can talk about these things to each other, sex can continue, a less pressured, touch-based, less-orgasm-focused sex that both men and women often prefer. Lots of couples are missing out on this slower, more erotic sex simply because they can’t bring themselves to talk about it.It’s not difficult to do. Simply say, “I was thinking the other day that we haven’t had sex for ages. I miss it. Can we talk about how to get things going again?”Sex toys can solve many of your problems.As our bodies change and medical conditions start to kick in, so do sex problems. But for every problem, there’s a solution, and that solution is often a sex toy. Today’s lightweight vibrators solve that issue in the press of a button. If you’re single or not having sex with your partner, they keep everything in good working order and you sexually satisfied. Masturbating regularly has enormous physical and emotional benefits as orgasms reduce anxiety and may help keep us from getting depressed.It truly is a case of “use it or lose it” with our genitals after 40, let alone 60. Yet, there’s a whole generation of women in their 40s, 50s and over who missed the vibrator revolution and never caught up. If you are a woman over 50 who doesn’t own a vibrator, buying and using one will almost certainly guarantee you are more sexually satisfied than you are now. Sex toys are also an instant, effective, low effort way to add variety to a stale sex life.Tracey Cox is one of the world’s most famous sex experts and writers on sex and relationships. She has written 17 books, many of which are bestsellers and available in over 20 languages. Her latest,Great Sex Starts At 50: How to Age-Proof Your Libido,is available now.

44,"https://www.aarpethel.com/fulfillment/why-moms-and-grandmothers-need-to-flaunt-their-sexuality
",12/4/2021,Why Moms and Grandmothers Need to Flaunt Their Sexuality,"At 13, I squirreled away money from the coin dish on the fireplace mantle to buy my first sanitary pads and training bra. Despite graduating from Radcliffe and giving birth to five children, my beautiful, brainy mother found talking about puberty, menstruation, intercourse and birth control too shameful to discuss with me or my sisters. We were on our own, with mixed results.Sometimes, your mother teaches you who to be as an adult woman. Sometimes, she teaches you who youdon’twant to be. When my turn came, I talked, early and openly, to my children about sex.Then, at 49, I got divorced. As a wife and mom, I’d jettisoned my sexiest parts in the slushy joy of motherhood. I’d immersed myself in pregnancy and breastfeeding, coaching peewee soccer, cooking Tater Tots and chicken nuggets, wearing flannel nightgowns and socks to bed. I adored this chapter of womanhood. But passing my 50th birthday as an older single mom, I knew it was over.As I reconnected with myself, my hair got longer and blonder. My jeans got tighter. I replaced my minivan with a sports car. I dated scads of younger men. In the mirror, I saw my erotic self again.I’m older now than my mother was at the time of my adolescence. I understand her trauma-informed approach to sex ed. Ignorance, and even abhorrence, of sex was de rigueur for a refined woman of her generation. Even today’s new parents can find it excruciating to talk to young children about their sexuality.But for seasoned parents with adult kids, the far harder task? Talking with our kids openly aboutoursexuality. The sexy side of mom wasn’t a part of me that my kids had ever seen. And herein lies a particularly challenging rub for women. How can we be sexual women while being moms and grandmas?Like my mother, most women are bombarded with the societal mandate that being overtly sensual risks social condemnation or exile — the slut-shaming we all experience. This is especially true when we become mothers and grandmothers.  A hot momma is the punchline of jokes. A sexy grandma? Eeeww!!!As evidence of our society’s double standard, imagine your favorite 50-plus divorced dad or grandpa. He buys a sporty car. Dyes his hair. Dates five women. Cute, yes?

It’s time to ask ourselves, why can’t we older women embrace our sexual personalities? Like so many dictums about women, the sexually neutered older-female stereotype is destructive to us and to our relationships with our loved ones.“Hiding our sexuality negates how layered we are. Though older now, we don’t stop being who we were when we were younger,” explains Karen Lieberman Troccoli, a Maryland-based nurse practitioner . “The phases of life may make us hit the pause button on certain aspects of self, but when the movie rolls again, that’s something to celebrate. Parents who are having sex signal there’s still intimacy, closeness and love. And that’s a healthy message for kids.”We count. Our sexuality is precious — despite the messages we get from the youth-centric media, charity-fundraiser matrons and even our most-beloved family members that we need to disguise or subdue our sexuality in order to be cherished and accepted.A mom to two irrepressible teenage boys and a longtime friend of mine offered advice that made my heart grow two sizes bigger.“Leslie,” she told me. “Most kids never see who their mom really is. By writing this book, you are showing them your full self.  Including your sexuality. You are giving them a gift most kids don’t get from their mom.”I never got that from my mother, and it was a loss for us both.“Embracing the full vibrance of who we are at every age can imbue our children with the courage to be fully and joyfully themselves and to look forward to every stage oftheirlives,” says California-based leadership and relationship coach Michele Taipale. “If we saddle our sexuality with shame, we give in to the notion that aging is decline. Mind-blowing sex comes from the exuberant embrace of our sensual selves, the abdication of ego to sensation, and the deep dive into human connection. This is ageless.

Visit her via herwebsite,Facebook,Instagram,LinkedInandTwitter.","At 13, I squirreled away money from the coin dish on the fireplace mantle to buy my first sanitary pads and training bra. Despite graduating from Radcliffe and giving birth to five children, my beautiful, brainy mother found talking about puberty, menstruation, intercourse and birth control too shameful to discuss with me or my sisters. We were on our own, with mixed results.Sometimes, your mother teaches you who to be as an adult woman. Sometimes, she teaches you who youdon’twant to be. When my turn came, I talked, early and openly, to my children about sex.Then, at 49, I got divorced. As a wife and mom, I’d jettisoned my sexiest parts in the slushy joy of motherhood. I’d immersed myself in pregnancy and breastfeeding, coaching peewee soccer, cooking Tater Tots and chicken nuggets, wearing flannel nightgowns and socks to bed. I adored this chapter of womanhood. But passing my 50th birthday as an older single mom, I knew it was over.As I reconnected with myself, my hair got longer and blonder. My jeans got tighter. I replaced my minivan with a sports car. I dated scads of younger men. In the mirror, I saw my erotic self again.I’m older now than my mother was at the time of my adolescence. I understand her trauma-informed approach to sex ed. Ignorance, and even abhorrence, of sex was de rigueur for a refined woman of her generation. Even today’s new parents can find it excruciating to talk to young children about their sexuality.But for seasoned parents with adult kids, the far harder task? Talking with our kids openly aboutoursexuality. The sexy side of mom wasn’t a part of me that my kids had ever seen. And herein lies a particularly challenging rub for women.

",7/2/2022,Hats Are Back!,"Hats are back — though for people like me, they’ve never gone away. I’ve loved them since I was 4 years old, prancing around in my white bowler Easter hat, with red and yellow flowers around the brim. In my teens, I loved soft wool cloche beanies and large-brimmed straw hats that made me feel like a movie star.Hats made me feel edgier and definitely better because they hid my prominent proboscis. I am now 63, and I still am adventurous in seeking out the trendiest and edgiest hats to wear. The hottest sellers for women of a certain age are soft knit hats that cling to the head, and wide-brimmed fedoras in cool pastels like dusty pink and baby blue, says Christina Dove, an e-commerce general manager who works for Hats in the Belfry, a sixth-generation hat store located in Baltimore and Annapolis, Maryland.Dove, along with a small staff of 17, designs and sells hats to customers throughout the world. Hats in the Belfry has been around for the past 42 years and the staff keeps a sharp eye out for what’s trendy.“People in their 60s and up buy a lot of wool and leather newsboy caps [caps with a bigger crown sort of like an undersized baseball cap], and fedoras,” Dove says. “But we find that hats are ageless. In spring and summer, the knit caps sell out equally with old and young people. It doesn’t matter the weather, it’s a great topper at all times of the year.”For us girls in our 50s and up, Hats in the Belfry is selling out the porkpie hat, a circular hat with its brim turned up. Proving hats are ageless and timeless, in the 1920s, singer Josephine Baker made her signature hats, both cloche and tilted wide-brimmed styles — trendsetters that still reign today in the fashion industry. Multimedia artist Yoko Ono popularized the fedora.For those riding their own ranges, the Stetson cowboy hat is still popular. “We curate the entire Stetson collection,” Dove says. “People wear Stetsons because they keep out the sun during the day but are warm at night. They can also be customized by shaping the brim.”Beyond the trends, for many cultures hats mean history. In the African American community, ornate church hats have been worn by women for generations. These hats can be large and adorned with feathers, ribbons and bows — most in bright colors to match brightly colored suits and dresses.“These are the hats that show who we are,” says Gail Hogan, a longtime churchgoer in the African American community. “We put our faith first, but we have style.”Stylish churchgoers are not alone in their love of ornate head coverings. During the Victorian era, women wore bold, brimmed hats with flowers and large plumes. These toppers, called “bonnets,” were made of linen, straw, felt and other exquisite fabrics.The important aspect of Victorian hat wearing was much the same as today: They covered your face from the sun. Back then, wearing hats kept your skin pale, and that represented wealth. Now, we know that hats can also help keep skin cancer at bay.From Elizabethan times when they were a symbol to today’s desire to express individual style, hats are here to stay. A woman’s choice of hats can evoke many a mood, from mysterious to sexy, particularly accomplished with a velvet pillbox that comes with an eye-covering veil. Diane Keaton inspired legions of women in the 1970s through this day with her black felt Annie Hall hat. In the ’30s and ’40s, admirers of Greta Garbo copied her trademark beret. Audrey Hepburn could rock an unusual hat like no one else. In her role as Holly Golightly in a scene fromBreakfast at Tiffany’s,she wore a mink hat by Givenchy.Almost no one has inspired hat envy as much as Britain’s Queen Elizabeth with her toppers of mint green and lemon yellow — and other wild shades. Known for her pastel suits and matching hats since 1952, it’s estimated the queen has donned at least 5,000 different pieces of headgear during the past half-century.For me, I love all hats whether they are felt, cotton or wool, from sharp fedoras to bucket-style cloches. Hat addicts like me come in all ages and sizes, though we are bound by these common traits: We’re a bit brash and unafraid. We’re not seeking attention. Attention is seeking us.Jeannie Rapstad, president at Jeannie Rapstad Enterprises and a Purdue University professor, is well-known for her ever-growing collection of hats. She buys them everywhere and now has 115 styles in her closet. Her story about how she came to wearing hats is a little different from that of the average woman.Rapstad didn’t get her advanced degree in English until she was age 69. When she started job hunting, she had to compete with much younger candidates.“I went to a networking event and I overheard, ‘Who’s the old broad in the corner?’ and the old broad was me,” recalls Rapstad. To her next interviews, she wore a red bowler.“Now people will start saying, ‘Who’s the classy dame in the hat?’ ” she says with a laugh.At my age, I no longer care what people are saying about me. With or without the right hat, I feel feisty and free. Though the hat does help.","Hats are back — though for people like me, they’ve never gone away.

",21-02-2022,Jobs for Retirees Who Want to Keep Working,"For help finding work, check out theAARP Job Board.A year ago, I left a perfectly satisfying job running leadership programs for senior executives to start my own coaching business. It was hard enough for me to comprehend why I would, at 63, leave a rewarding job with benefits to go back out on my own, much less explain it to others.“Congratulations on your retirement!” was the most common refrain. My response was usually mumbling something along the lines of, “Well, I’m not really retiring. I’m just making a change.”Truth be told, I wasn’t ready to stop working. Instead, I wanted to make a final mark in my career, had earned the means to take that risk and desired greater autonomy. If anything, I was ready to work harder if it meant I was learning, growing and creating something I was proud of.I’m not alone in wanting to keep working whether paid or unpaid as someone who might otherwise be labeled a retiree. What this looks like and why we do it can vary from needing to meet monthly bills to keeping ourselves busy with activities that feed our hearts and minds, or both.Take Lynn Jackson. Eight months ago, she retired from 30-plus years in the federal government, relieved to trade in the daily grind, stress and hassles of dealing with a difficult coworker for time singing, playing the piano and gardening. However, a month ago she shared that an irresistible offer from her old job was “too good to pass up.”As a “retired annuitant” she plans to return to the same agency and enjoy a good hourly rate on top of her retirement benefits.The good news is that we are living longer and benefiting from changes in the workplace as jobs are becoming less physically demanding, technology is getting easier and more accessible, and remote options are expanding our horizons. In addition, the phenomenon of Americans leaving their jobs at record rates this year — the Great Resignation — is creating more opportunity as employers are desperate to fill empty slots.The questions, then, are about what you want and need at this point in your life: Do you need to make money and, if so, how much?What kind of benefits matter? Do you need health insurance, or are you looking for benefits such as flexibility, autonomy, legacy?Do you just want to get out of the house, keep a flame of passion alive, or to give back? These questions are important in guiding decisions about the direction the job search will take postretirement. The R word, after all, can also mean recharging, resurrecting old interests and reinvention.Self-employmentIf you have a skill or expertise of value to others, you can trade time or money for those services, especially in an ever-growing gig economy. Enjoy bookkeeping, gardening, pet care, tutoring, cooking? These are examples of valuable and needed services busy professionals or growing small businesses will pay for.Depending on demand and level of mastery, you can be confident in charging what you are worth and can often set the schedule you want. The key is to know what the market will bear and the level of demand for your services — and also being willing to invest time and energy in getting the word out. Hanging out a shingle for your services can seem daunting, especially if you aren’t sure how far you want to go as a freelancer or business owner. Luckily, there are ample resources available online and through community groups and libraries geared toward helping entrepreneurs like Lia Zumes, who, at 60, launched her own digital course after a career in corporate. “I’m not a digital native, and I did this myself!” says Zumes, who is passionate about elevating executives like herself who want to continue to retool and reinvent. As she puts it, “I’m looking for the joy. I’m stepping into my creativity and loving it.”Part- or full-time workThe current job market is eager for workers, especially those who can fill in gaps part-time. Some of the top 25 jobs for retirees listed by AARP in March 2020 included bus drivers, nannies, sales associates and office managers. According to the article, which cites research by AARP’s Public Policy Institute published in 2018, workers 65 and older are twice as likely to work part-time as workers ages 25 to 64. This same study states that, “The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projects that employment will increase by 11.5 million people over the decade 2016–26 and that by 2026 there will be almost 170 million people in the U..S labor force. This includes 42 million people ages 55 and older. The BLS also forecasts that the 65–74 and 75 and older age groups will have faster rates of annual labor force growth than any other age groups.”Along with a changing job market, companies and even states are recognizing the value of hiring older persons who might have a stronger work ethic and broader experience than their younger counterparts. In Wyoming, for example, financial incentives like low cost of living and zero income, estate or inheritance taxes helps it rank among the top 10 states attractive to seniors. Nevada, Arizona, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Tennessee and South Carolina are also on the list.As a retiree getting back in the workforce, make sure to communicate the competencies or sets of skills you offer and tie them to the skills desired. It also helps to be clear about why you are applying. Though you may show up as overqualified, your potential employer may be convinced you will be a good fit.VolunteeringFinally, volunteering can offer retirees a rewarding experience of giving back and staying active. Opportunity abounds in this space whether it is offering time and skills in a nonprofit or simply helping neighbors and friends with daily living. Positions that offer intellectual rewards include being a docent at a museum, helping the underserved find a job or housing and helping teachers in the classroom. Meeting critical needs like serving in a food kitchen or transporting someone to get chemo treatment can be life affirming and remind us of how we may one day rely on such generosity. In short, we learn the gift of giving and receiving — something we can pass along to others.Whatever your path to engagement in the workforce, there is something here for all of us. The job after you “retire” may be the best job you will ever have.","For help finding work, check out theAARP Job Board.A year ago, I left a perfectly satisfying job running leadership programs for senior executives to start my own coaching business.

47,"https://www.aarpethel.com/health/im-48-and-i-need-hearing-aids
",10/7/2020,I'm 48 and I Need Hearing Aids,"When I was younger, I watched my father struggle with heart disease, and I vowed not to let that happen to me. So I became a health nut. I’ve tried every gym class you can think of, from aerial yoga to Zumba. I’ve run marathons and practiced so much yoga I became a teacher. I’ve eaten fish two times a week, snacked on walnuts, and bought one of those blenders that is so powerful it makes my walls shake. I defend my red wine habit because I feel I’ve got research on my side. I stay up to date on all my health screenings.So last summer when I couldn’t hear a thing my 8-year old niece said, I knew I needed ahearing test. But I didn’t have any other symptoms. I could hear well in everyday conversations. Eating at restaurants didn’t bother me. I wasn’t cutting back on my social calendar because of my hearing. So I put off getting tested.And then one day I read about a study abouthearing loss and dementiathat changed my mind. Dementia runs in my family, so I pay attention to this type of stuff. While researchers are still trying to figure out cause and effect in the relationship between the two, one of the theories I see a lot is that people with hearing loss skip out on social activities when they can’t hear well, and that affects the brain. Since that wasn’t me, I wasn’t too concerned.Butthis storywas different, and it scared me.

So I became a health nut. I’ve tried every gym class you can think of, from aerial yoga to Zumba. I’ve run marathons and practiced so much yoga I became a teacher. I’ve eaten fish two times a week, snacked on walnuts, and bought one of those blenders that is so powerful it makes my walls shake. I defend my red wine habit because I feel I’ve got research on my side. I stay up to date on all my health screenings.So last summer when I couldn’t hear a thing my 8-year old niece said, I knew I needed ahearing test. But I didn’t have any other symptoms. I could hear well in everyday conversations. Eating at restaurants didn’t bother me. I wasn’t cutting back on my social calendar because of my hearing. So I put off getting tested.And then one day I read about a study abouthearing loss and dementiathat changed my mind. Dementia runs in my family, so I pay attention to this type of stuff. While researchers are still trying to figure out cause and effect in the relationship between the two, one of the theories I see a lot is that people with hearing loss skip out on social activities when they can’t hear well, and that affects the brain. Since that wasn’t me, I wasn’t too concerned.Butthis storywas different, and it scared me.

",26-04-2021,Call Me Gigi or Mimi But Not Grandma,"I am only 42 — though always thinking ahead. So when my oldest child, 17-year-old Molly, asked me what I want my grandkids to call me, I was taken aback. I stared blankly, perhaps overcome with panic.Grandma? Who, me? Um …This is not something I’m in any way ready for. Can we please just change the topic?I was not focusing on the joys of holding my offspring’s offspring in my arms or the sweet smell of an infant that might leave me giddy with excitement. I was thinking of the outdated stereotype (of course, no longer true as women are living longer and more vibrant than ever):wrinkles and housecoats and curlers and a blurred memory to match.Grandmotherhood? No thank you, Molly. I am good.Yet Molly’s question lingered. Would I ever feel ready to be a grandma, and if so, what would I want my grandkids to call me? What are the options? How do these nicknames develop? Am I the only one who associates the word grandma (and I guess the role of it, too) with being old and perhaps a bit feeble? I reached out to a few ageless grandmothers and asked them just how they decided on the name they wanted to be called.In her late 70s, Maryland visual artist Gail Watkins says age didn’t play a factor in her choice. “I never gave much thought to whether Grandma sounded too old; I just knew I needed to be called something that felt good.” Watkins has five grandchildren, ages 8 to 21. “They call me Gigi,” she adds, a name she describes as “an upper – it gives me a kick. I also thought I’d better pick my own name before I got labeled with something I didn’t like.” Watkins was, however, labeled with a nickname for her nickname when at age 2, her granddaughter Hannah went down a water slide and yelled “Yo, Geege!” illustrating that sometimes the choice might not entirely be our own. Fortunately, she’s happy to embrace both Gigi and Geege.Publicist Marla White, 57, of Fontana, California, is a grandmother to two girls, one almost 2 and the other 13. White admits that the name Grandma did, indeed, make her feel just a little too old. “I was a young mom and subsequently a young grandma,” she recalls. “So, we went with Glama. I have always loved Goldie Hawn and that’s what she was called.” White even has a license plate and a bracelet that proudly display the Goldie-inspired name.Then there is my own mother, retired teacher Nan Hayes, 72, and grandmother to seven, who has always been known to have strong opinions. She is openly puzzled why Grandma and Grandpa aren’t good enough anymore.“For hundreds of years Grandma and Grandpa were the traditional terms for grandparents,” she says. “Those monikers were proudly used by grandparents all over America. So when and why did that valued tradition change? Did the image of gray hair and rocking chairs make younger grandparents cringe? Did they, therefore, suggest to their children that they wanted to be called Mimi or Grampy? Do people just want to be different?”Not surprisingly, my mom established that her own children call both of our grandmothers by the traditional Grandma. And I did feel the traditional name fit them both. My grandmas were strong female role models who made mothering and grandmothering look easy and fun. I picture them hand-whipping mashed potatoes for a table of 12, putting a dollar in the birthday cards to each and every grandchild (over 60 combined), and never failing to tell me I look better with my hair off of my face.Interestingly, my mother did not follow in this Grandma tradition about which she felt strongly. Rather, she ended up being called Nan, a short version of her first name Nancy. It suits her very well. But what’s in a name, anyway? Grandmas, like all humans, come in all shapes and sizes. They can be fit and active and youthful and daring. They can have gray hair or brown hair — and pink highlights if they choose. Grandmas can be bold and loud and run a marathon or do hot yoga. They can dance barefoot in the grass or in high heels in their kitchen.The only thing we know about all grandmothers is that they have grandchildren. And that is a blessing any way you slice it — and it’s one that every Grandma or Gigi or Mimi should cherish wholeheartedly, with an awareness that this passage in life is, indeed, one of life’s greatest miracles.White says it best: “There’s nothing like it in the world. Remember how your heart burst when you first met your child? Multiply that times 1,000 and that’s what being a grandmother is all about. It may be a surprise; it may make you feel old. But trust me, it will make you feel a love bigger than anything you ever felt before — and that’s ageless.”Suzanne E.

",8/10/2021,5 Ways to Refresh Your Face Without Surgery,"Marionette lines. That’s what those vertical lines on either side of my mouth were going to turn into — something old and creaky like Howdy Doody. But old and creaky is not how I feel or view myself. And that appears to be the case with many other like-minded women.While we have developed fine lines, sun spots and wrinkles, specialties such as aesthetics and cosmetic dermatology have come of age to help us neutralize and erase them. Twenty years ago there were only a few options to counter the effects of time. Today we have dozens of choices to plump, smooth, tighten and tone our skin.“With these nonsurgical solutions, you can really improve the texture and pigmentation of the skin,” says Martin Zaiac, M.D., a Miami Beach–based, board-certified dermatologist who has practiced in this sun-and-glamour capital for nearly 30 years. He’s the director of the Department of Dermatology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach and cofounder of the Greater Miami Skin & Laser Center. “That’s something a surgical face-lift doesn’t address. The quality of the skin after a face-lift can still be an issue.”Setting ExpectationsWhatever path you follow, it’s important to understand that not all skin is created equal. “Two women can have the same treatment from the same person on the same day and get two different results,” notes nurse practitioner Gloria Peithman, a master injector who has performed more than 115,000 procedures. She founded Chesapeake Laser and Skin Care Center on Kent Island, Maryland, 15 years ago and previously worked in cardiac surgery and emergency medicine as a nurse practitioner. “Smoking, alcohol use, sun exposure, genetics and medical history all play a role in a patient’s results.”Regardless of what you may see on social media, those results seldom are immediate. “Before-and-after pictures can be misleading,” Peithman adds. “It takes time in between to recover and achieve the full effect of a treatment. Sometimes that’s a couple of days, and other times it’s a few weeks. A lot depends on the quality of the skin going into it.”For long-lasting results, the best strategy is to maintain and build. “You don’t want to do all this work and then not keep it up so your skin goes back to zero,” says Zaiac, who warns to keep in mind that these are medical procedures. Find someone you can trust not only for safety but to deliver an age-appropriate solution that, he points out, “fits your lifestyle and doesn’t look overdone.”The TreatmentsWith so many choices, where do you start? Here are five recommendations from the experts.Botulinum InjectionsMuscle injections such as Botox, Dysport and Jeuveau are designed to win what Zaiac calls the “tug of war with muscles that lift up and down,” causing wrinkles, lines and sagging. Short-lived and predictable, these injections around the eyes, forehead and mouth are among the least expensive nonsurgical solutions and need repeating every three to five months. They often serve as a starting point for a bigger discussion about overall skin care.Dermal FillersAvailable in a range of viscosity, from very soft to thicker, dermal fillers can be used individually, to treat a specific concern, or in tandem to create a larger-area “liquid face-lift,” Peithman says. Common brands include Juvéderm, Restylane, Radiesse and Sculptra. They work by replacing the volume of lost fat and collagen in tissue and even bone, in the cheeks and chin. “Like a balloon, dermal fillers act to inflate the skin and give it better tone,” she explains. If fillers have a hyaluronic acid base, their effects can often be reversed within 24 to 48 hours, if the patient isn’t satisfied with the results. Otherwise, it will take about two weeks to achieve the best results. Maintenance varies from six to nine months, depending on the product’s viscosity and the patient’s metabolism.Chemical PeelsLight to medium chemical peels can be used to reveal skin that appears smoother, less wrinkled and more even in tone, Zaiac says. During treatment, the specialist applies an acid-based solution that causes the top layers of skin to shed. Patients feel heat that may last up to 10 minutes. Afterward, a common side effect is a mild to moderate reaction similar to a sunburn; this can last up to five days. Peels are effective at reducing fine lines, improving mild scars and correcting skin discoloration. Another option is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a topical medication along with light to kill precancerous cells. Because of its medical nature, PDT is often covered by insurance. Besides selectively eliminating dangerous cells, it has the “benefit of cosmetic improvement, too,” notes Zaiac, including enhanced skin tone, color and texture.Radiofrequency TechnologyUsing a noninvasive technique, Food and Drug Administration–cleared treatments such as Thermage, Exilis and Thermi can treat wrinkles and loose skin by remodeling collagen layers beneath the skin’s surface, according to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS). This causes skin to tighten immediately and stimulates new collagen growth over the subsequent few months, for additional tightening. Plus, this technology can safely treat a range of skin tones. Radiofrequency therapy has evolved since its introduction in 2001, the ABSC reports. Making multiple passes with lower-frequency pulses reduces patient discomfort during the treatment. Afterward, there’s little to no bruising or redness and minimal swelling. Maintenance typically involves follow-up treatments every two years.Laser Skin ResurfacingAlthough these treatments can be “more aggressive and require more downtime,” Zaiac says, “they can make a tremendous change.” The technology is available in a range of intensities that work to destroy damaged skin cells and stimulate the growth of new, healthy ones. Whether you want to address wrinkles, age spots, sun damage or something else will determine which technology is recommended. For sun damage that’s led to uneven pigmentation on the chest and arms, Zaiac uses a laser treatment that simultaneously delivers two wavelengths to the skin’s outer and deeper layers.Downtime for this treatment involves two to three days of redness and swelling, but other options can require a two- to three-week healing process. The shorter days of fall and winter are often considered ideal times for laser resurfacing because this technology can make skin hypersensitive to sun exposure.","Marionette lines.

Short-lived and predictable, these injections around the eyes, forehead and mouth are among the least expensive nonsurgical solutions and need repeating every three to five months. They often serve as a starting point for a bigger discussion about overall skin care.Dermal FillersAvailable in a range of viscosity, from very soft to thicker, dermal fillers can be used individually, to treat a specific concern, or in tandem to create a larger-area “liquid face-lift,” Peithman says. Common brands include Juvéderm, Restylane, Radiesse and Sculptra. They work by replacing the volume of lost fat and collagen in tissue and even bone, in the cheeks and chin. “Like a balloon, dermal fillers act to inflate the skin and give it better tone,” she explains. If fillers have a hyaluronic acid base, their effects can often be reversed within 24 to 48 hours, if the patient isn’t satisfied with the results. Otherwise, it will take about two weeks to achieve the best results. Maintenance varies from six to nine months, depending on the product’s viscosity and the patient’s metabolism.Chemical PeelsLight to medium chemical peels can be used to reveal skin that appears smoother, less wrinkled and more even in tone, Zaiac says. During treatment, the specialist applies an acid-based solution that causes the top layers of skin to shed. Patients feel heat that may last up to 10 minutes. Afterward, a common side effect is a mild to moderate reaction similar to a sunburn; this can last up to five days. Peels are effective at reducing fine lines, improving mild scars and correcting skin discoloration. Another option is photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses a topical medication along with light to kill precancerous cells. Because of its medical nature, PDT is often covered by insurance. Besides selectively eliminating dangerous cells, it has the “benefit of cosmetic improvement, too,” notes Zaiac, including enhanced skin tone, color and texture.Radiofrequency TechnologyUsing a noninvasive technique, Food and Drug Administration–cleared treatments such as Thermage, Exilis and Thermi can treat wrinkles and loose skin by remodeling collagen layers beneath the skin’s surface, according to the American Board of Cosmetic Surgery (ABCS). This causes skin to tighten immediately and stimulates new collagen growth over the subsequent few months, for additional tightening. Plus, this technology can safely treat a range of skin tones. Radiofrequency therapy has evolved since its introduction in 2001, the ABSC reports. Making multiple passes with lower-frequency pulses reduces patient discomfort during the treatment. Afterward, there’s little to no bruising or redness and minimal swelling. Maintenance typically involves follow-up treatments every two years.Laser Skin ResurfacingAlthough these treatments can be “more aggressive and require more downtime,” Zaiac says, “they can make a tremendous change.” The technology is available in a range of intensities that work to destroy damaged skin cells and stimulate the growth of new, healthy ones. Whether you want to address wrinkles, age spots, sun damage or something else will determine which technology is recommended. For sun damage that’s led to uneven pigmentation on the chest and arms, Zaiac uses a laser treatment that simultaneously delivers two wavelengths to the skin’s outer and deeper layers.Downtime for this treatment involves two to three days of redness and swelling, but other options can require a two- to three-week healing process. The shorter days of fall and winter are often considered ideal times for laser resurfacing because this technology can make skin hypersensitive to sun exposure."

",24-01-2022,"Why I Will Never, Ever Go Gray","My first strands of gray were spotted when I was only 13, in pigtails. During a tennis match, my opponent commented on how cool my hair was with the white strands spreading along the part on the back of my scalp.As a young teen, it did feel cool. But at 22, as the strands began to multiply, the coolness began to diminish. As a dark brunette, there’s no such thing ascovering it up. There’s no blending. The gray strands are magnets to the eye. It is like being at a party with a stain right in the center of your shirt. And that is all you become focused on. At 22, that’s how I felt about my gray hairs. They were a stain on my head, an image that remains today.We can agree that many older women have shucked the dyes and gone gray, with beauty and panache. I know that could not be me. I am my mother’s daughter. For over 60 years, I watched my mother “wash that gray right out of my hair,” as the actress sings in the old Clairol TV commercial — this after she laments: “My gray hair makes me feelsoooold.” I was raised to believe that dying your hair was part of the natural aging process.But then the pandemic hit, and we are reading about women (and seeing our friends) avoiding salons — caring more about our health than our hair color and embracing the ease and look of going silver. It makes perfect sense that trying to find a diminishing supply of Clorox wipes became more important than touching up roots. For nearly two years, we had few places to go out and nowhere to be seen.Though some of my friends were flaunting silver locks, I still dyed my hair. Even when the stars looked more gorgeous than ever by going au naturel.For many years, some of the hottest women in Hollywood have been proudly parading their silvery tresses on red carpets, on magazine covers and in interviews. Jane Fonda rocked it at the Oscars, claiming in an interview with Ellen DeGeneres that “she’s feeling totally liberated.” Glenn Close was spotted at the Screen Actors Guild Awards sporting her transition from blond to gray, while Andie MacDowell showcased her salt-and-pepper hues at the Cannes Film Festival, stating in a 2021 interview inVoguemagazine that she “never felt more powerful.”Helen Mirren, Diane Keaton, Jamie Lee Curtis and Meryl Streep allowed their authentic gray to dominate long before it became trendy. Can it be that gray is the new blond? Apparently, as a documentary with the same title had its world premiere on Jan. 23, 2020, in Los Angeles, inspiring women to “go gray on purpose.” As reported byWhat’s Up?magazine’s August 2019 online edition, “granny hair,” a term to indicate gray or silver locks, has become the latest trend of womenwillfullygoing gray.Will 50 shades of gray now come in a bottle? Not in my bottle.I never went blond for the same reason I will never go gray. It does not compliment my skin tone, nor match my personality. I am a brunette! I would feel washed out, dull. Ilivein color. My home and my attire are both accentuatedin bold color.A thorough search of my closet reveals only three items of clothing that are predominantly gray. And of two of the three I have not worn in some 20 years. I guess I am like the woman on that Clairol commercial — gray makes me feel so old!Gray also makes me look older. Several years ago, before I turned 60 and was well overdue for a touch-up, I was offered, without asking, the senior discount by the cashier at my neighborhood grocery. Remaining a forever-brunette, though, is not an attempt at disguising my age. To the contrary. I just want to look my age. I may be vain. I may even be perceived as artificial. But I am nothing if I am not loyal. For the past 40 years, I have been alternating hair coloring regimens between my salon with Nicole, and my bathroom with Preference by L’Oréal No. 5.The pandemic may have temporarily shuttered the salons, and for many women that was apparently life-changing and trendsetting. For me, it was convenient and cost effective. Nicole made house calls to the backyard. I saved on gas. I saved on my time. Talk about life-changing.I will never go gray for the same reason I choose to work out and control what I eat. It is the same reason I do not leave home without makeup. It is the reason I wear Spanx when I get dressed up. I like how these rituals and routines make me feel when I look in the mirror. As a mother and wife, I make all sorts of choices to bolster my family.These beauty choices are all about me, not about how I am viewed by others.When I leave the hair salon or my bathroom, depending on where the dye is being applied, I feel an immediate sense of rejuvenation. Even my complexion takes on a new glow. I stand taller and feel sexier. Having washed that gray right out of my hair, I feel like the real me and empowered to stand out.

",4/8/2020,I Used an Electric Scooter … and I’m OK with That!,"This past Sunday morning, I ventured out to get some errands done at my local big-box superstore. I needed to return an item and wanted to purchase some staples — LaCroix, vitamin D3 and cat treats.My shopping trips lately have been abbreviated as a result of increasing arthritis pain in my knees. I had a short list so I could quickly get what I need and dash out. Today, though, I longed for a slow, luxurious shopping experience, one in which I could explore the whole store, pore over seasonal decor and search for sales.As I walked through the automatic doors I saw it — a fully charged, unoccupied electric scooter. Ever since I started experiencing the pain of severe arthritis in both knees, I’ve contemplated taking the leap and trying out a motorized shopping cart. Understandably, my pride had always stepped in to keep me from using one. Also, what if I see someone I know? Shouldn’t I leave them available for people who really need them? What if this means I’ve given in to my diagnosis and this is just the beginning of other crutches that lead me prematurely to old age-hood at 55?Ultimately, with the urging of a friend who used one temporarily during chemo treatments, I put aside all of my doubts and concerns and went ahead and tried it out.For sure, the beginning was the worst part. I was as nervous as a kid learning to ride a two-wheeler. There were directions to read, but that just got in the way of zooming off into quick anonymity. So I just turned it on and figured it out as I went.Don’t underestimate the pleasure of shopping while sitting down. Also, don’t be surprised by how fun it is to drive one of those things. And, not surprisingly, people were nice. Really, really nice. When I dropped a jar of vitamin gummies, a kind, middle-aged gentleman picked them up for me. When I veered down a crowded aisle, people made room for me. And when I was struggling a bit at the checkout, a store employee was super helpful.Since that first outing, I must confess that I’ve gone a bunch more times and availed myself of the scooter. In fact, I even researched which store chains routinely have them available: Walmart, Target, Lowe’s and Costco, to name a few. I find myself frequenting those stores more often than the retailers who don’t offer the service.My knee pain continues to be chronic, and — as a result of getting over my fears of using an electric cart and experiencing the ease and joy of using one — I continue to use them and seek out stores that I know have them charged and ready to go. Sure, there was the time the battery power ran out and I was stranded in the middle of the paper towel aisle. But not to worry! An associate magically appeared and veered the cart back manually to the front of the store while I walked up and checked out.And, yes, the clothing aisles are definitely a chronic problem in many stores. Too many clothes packed into too little space, leaving barely enough room to maneuver. Yup, I knocked over a whole stand of clothes once. Oops.Yet since the COVID-19 pandemic, ironically some of the kindness has dissipated. Are people just on edge or worried about the distancing as a result of the space the cart takes up? Not sure. Yes, not everyone has been nice. But I have to assume that they’re probably not nice in other areas of their life, too, and my cart and I have nothing to do with their miserable nature.But either way, I can’t control others, only myself. And as for me, well ... I’ll be taking the scooter.","This past Sunday morning, I ventured out to get some errands done at my local big-box superstore.

",25-10-2021,Say Goodbye to Trouble Zones With This Whole Body Workout,"“Shrink belly fat in 24 hours!” declares the online ad that drops into your social media feed. “Arm jiggle will be history after just one three-minute session with our miracle apparatus,” promises the next.It’s easy to be tempted by claims of miracle fixes, because they promise to give you exactly what you want — targeted fat reduction. Here’s the big reveal: Spot reducing is a myth; spot toning is not. Allegedly, when sculptor Michelangelo was asked about the process of creating his masterpieceDavid, he replied, “It is easy. You just chip away the stone that doesn’t look like David.”Every woman’s body is its own work of art waiting to be revealed. If you’re ready to chisel away the pieces that aren’t what you desire, then the powerhouse combination of strength and high- intensity interval training (HIIT) are the tools that are needed. It takes a blend of strategies: Resistance training to sculpt and define, as well as HIIT to reduce body fat. Both parts are needed to create that toned silhouette that you’re looking for.Step 1: Strengthen the muscleForget diamonds — these days muscles are a girl’s best friend. Building muscle is essential to creating a shapely physique and giving you the vitality to perform everyday activities more efficiently. It’s time to pick up the weights. If you want to shape it, tone it or lift it, weight training is the key. In short, muscles are youth. It’s not about being younger than you are, it’s about being a vibrant and energetic version of yourself now. Muscles are your body’s unsung heroes. Their work is more “behind the scenes.” Always necessary for the big production, but rarely considered a star player. Muscles are major contributors to many qualities that separate the aged from the ageless: endurance, agility, energy, coordination, balance and easy weight management. Muscle mass starts a process of what I call “The Great Decline” at about age 30. At that point you lose about 1 percent per year, with the loss accelerating in your 40s and beyond. If you give muscles the attention they deserve, though, you can have the strength and vitality of somebody decades younger. Defining and shaping your muscles is the fountain of youth, and it’s possible at any age.The best approach to maximize muscle work is to think “whole body,” not just the parts that show. All your muscles want to come out to play, and they actually play well together. Using the “Integrate, Don’t Isolate” method primes your body to perform functionally, the way nature intended. Whether it’s chasing the grandkids or hoisting a bag into the overhead compartment on a flight, real life is about twisting, bending, lifting and pulling. Functional integration recruits multiple muscle groups and trains them to work as a team, improving your metabolism, efficiency and balance while reducing your risk of injury.Step 2: Burn the fatOne of the facts about toning any area of the body is that it’s really about strengthening a muscle group while reducing body fat. Think of it as preparing the muscles for their big debut — pull back the curtain to let the stars shine! The reason spot toning doesn’t reduce fat is because fat belongs to your entire body, not to a muscle group. When you exercise and follow a sensible diet, you’ll start to lose fat. Genetics and lifestyle are the main factors that determine how and where you shed fat. We each have a one-of-a-kind fat-distribution pattern. Just like a fingerprint, how you gain fat, and lose fat, is unique to you. Each person’s fitness journey is rarely identical to anyone else’s. A couch-to-5K training program could lead to reduced belly fat for one woman and fat loss in the hips for another. So, when it comes to spot reducing, remember, each part of your body will lose fat at different rates.Accepting that you can’t dictate the exact location of weight loss doesn’t mean you can’t create a more sculpted version of yourself. The key is making sure you’re choosing the right movements. Hitting the sweet spot of maximum fat burn with minimum time investment is as easy as HIIT. Also called “interval” or “burst” training, HIIT is the key to igniting your calorie-burning engine during and for several hours after your workout. Short bursts of higher intensity are HIIT’s secret weapon against fat. For example, if you’re on a brisk walk, try upping your intensity for a 60-second burst, then continue at a steady-state pace for 60 seconds and continue this cycle for 10 minutes. Don’t be afraid to kick it into high gear during HIIT. The more effort you put in during the burst, the bigger the results. Focus on the gratifying rewards of sustained calorie and fat burn after the workout and enhanced cardio endurance. I’ve created this custom-workout that targets trouble spots while incorporating stability work that engages the entire body. Try this workout three times per week for a leaner, more sculpted, more energized version of yourself. There’s a tank top or skirt in your wardrobe waiting to adorn your masterpiece.

Here’s the big reveal: Spot reducing is a myth; spot toning is not. Allegedly, when sculptor Michelangelo was asked about the process of creating his masterpieceDavid, he replied, “It is easy. You just chip away the stone that doesn’t look like David.”Every woman’s body is its own work of art waiting to be revealed. If you’re ready to chisel away the pieces that aren’t what you desire, then the powerhouse combination of strength and high- intensity interval training (HIIT) are the tools that are needed. It takes a blend of strategies: Resistance training to sculpt and define, as well as HIIT to reduce body fat. Both parts are needed to create that toned silhouette that you’re looking for.Step 1: Strengthen the muscleForget diamonds — these days muscles are a girl’s best friend. Building muscle is essential to creating a shapely physique and giving you the vitality to perform everyday activities more efficiently. It’s time to pick up the weights. If you want to shape it, tone it or lift it, weight training is the key. In short, muscles are youth. It’s not about being younger than you are, it’s about being a vibrant and energetic version of yourself now. Muscles are your body’s unsung heroes. Their work is more “behind the scenes.” Always necessary for the big production, but rarely considered a star player. Muscles are major contributors to many qualities that separate the aged from the ageless: endurance, agility, energy, coordination, balance and easy weight management. Muscle mass starts a process of what I call “The Great Decline” at about age 30. At that point you lose about 1 percent per year, with the loss accelerating in your 40s and beyond. If you give muscles the attention they deserve, though, you can have the strength and vitality of somebody decades younger. Defining and shaping your muscles is the fountain of youth, and it’s possible at any age.The best approach to maximize muscle work is to think “whole body,” not just the parts that show. All your muscles want to come out to play, and they actually play well together. Using the “Integrate, Don’t Isolate” method primes your body to perform functionally, the way nature intended. Whether it’s chasing the grandkids or hoisting a bag into the overhead compartment on a flight, real life is about twisting, bending, lifting and pulling. Functional integration recruits multiple muscle groups and trains them to work as a team, improving your metabolism, efficiency and balance while reducing your risk of injury.Step 2: Burn the fatOne of the facts about toning any area of the body is that it’s really about strengthening a muscle group while reducing body fat.

I have a handful of old friends who understand how my younger self continues to evolve as they do, bringing us to the present point in our lives.My friendships spanning four to five decades are precious to me. However, as life changes along with our passions it is essential to make new friends with whom we can relate in the now, with overlapping interests and geographical proximity. My new close friends are culled from common activities I share with them at this stage in my life. I feel lucky to have enough of a network that I never have to be alone, if I so choose.Phyllis Hott is a therapist specializing in relationships who has been practicing in northern California for almost 30 years. We spoke about later-life bonding and how it can happen successfully.“It has to do with how open someone is in their own belief system,” Hott says. “Making new friends can be broken down to three parts. First, start with the intention that you want to connect. Then, have the willingness and action to move on that intention. Take the initiative to ask someone who you feel you could be friends with for their contact information and suggest meeting. For some of us, this takes courage.”I am basically a shy person, and I fear rejection. Yet, my curiosity and intuition are greater than my fear when I approach someone.“As women get older it’s hard to get out of a shell that no longer serve them,” Hott adds. “However later-life bonding is essential. Isolation and loneliness are killers.”Hott points to the island of Okinawa where the average age expectancy for women is 90 (84 for men), with a population of about 400 centenarians. The healthy diet of these super agers is heavy in fish, grains, vegetables (especially sweet potatoes) and seaweed products. Staying productive and socially engaged are also primary forces leading to longevity. The elders of Okinawa work well into their 80s and 90s, and many live among peers in senior communities or in multigenerational families.After 60, I took a few writing workshops to sharpen my skills and get feedback on my work. One of my teachers, 20 years my junior, became a close friend. We talk about projects we are working on, romantic relationships, our families and everything else. She is in the ecstatic throes of her 5-year-old marriage. I am long divorced, though now have grown closer to my ex.Though she is only 50, we both understand and appreciate our diverse perspectives on life, and I get to give a little aged wisdom.When I joined the National Arts Club, in my 60s, volunteering on the literary committee, I became close with another member whose life is very different from mine. She and her husband are comfortably retired executives, with four grown children and four grandchildren. As an artist, now writer, retirement is not my goal. This friend is used to being a “we,” I see myself as an “I” most of the time. Sometimes those types of particulars don’t matter.What does matter is connecting with empathy and sharing a sense of humor. After I fractured my neck in 2019, this new friend visited me in the hospital and during my recuperation at home. These later-life friendships are not superficial. We know the good and not so good about each other’s families, phobias and priorities.As I get older, I have found that I value deeper relationships with close friends even more and will go out of my way to maintain them. What it comes down to is that we only need a few good friends — to share interesting conversation, to support each other through challenges, to laugh together over dinners. There’s a richness in one-on-one relationships.Susan Rosenberg Jones, 70, a photographer with whom I have collaborated, is one of those new friends.

",9/7/2020,They Lost Their Jobs for Being Too Old,"What happens to those people who don’t just limit their stories about age discrimination to the friendly ears at the proverbial water cooler and instead actually attempt to seek enforcement of the protections they are entitled to under federal and state law?Is it worth the stress and aggravation of filing a complaint with the EEOC?Most of those who fought back against age discrimination in the workplace would say yes, it was worth it, according to Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, senior advisor to the chair of the EEOC and who, for 13 years, directed the age discrimination litigation program at AARP.Ventrell-Monsees said that the number of complaints by older workers who were put out to pasture prematurely or passed over for jobs has certainly increased — and so have the amounts for damages that juries have dinged companies who practice age discrimination.But, from her days as a litigator of age discrimination cases, she said, she rarely found a plaintiff “who was in it for the money.” Rather, she said, “most want to correct the wrong.”That seeking of social justice was what prompted Julianne Taaffe and Kathryn Moon tosue Ohio State Universityin 2015, a case that was settled last May when the two educators were awarded $765,000 in back pay. The bigger win though, may have been that the university agreed to review its policies for preventing and investigating age discrimination.As Jeff Vardaro of the Gittes Law Group that was part of their legal team said, “Julie and Kathy were committed throughout this process to achieving change that will prevent the same thing from happening again to them or their peers.”The two women insisted on a settlement that included effective, in-depth training and a top-to-bottom review of OSU’s discrimination investigation policies, Vardaro said. At the time of the settlement, attorney Fred Gittes called the case “remarkable” both for the “shocking” nature of the harassment and because Ohio State was committed to “fixing a system that’s really clearly broken,” he said.According tothe suit, Moon, who was 64 when the complaint was filed, had worked as an ESL instructor for 31 years at the university. Taaffe, who was 59 at the time, had worked there for more than 20 years. An ESL director was quoted in the lawsuit, saying that trying to get older teachers to modernize was like “herding hippos,” among other insults.Proving wrongful termination because of age is one thing. Proving you weren’t hired in the first place because you are too old is quite another, said Ventrell-Monsees.Take thecase of Army Master Fitness Trainer Lars Sandstrom, who at age 45 applied for a job with the Maui Police Department. During the 2009 interview, he was told it was doubtful that “someone your age can handle the training,” according to the complaint he filed with the EEOC. He also was questioned about how “someone your age could take orders from younger officers.He left the interview with what he described as the “most incredibly uncomfortable feeling of my life.” He felt betrayed and violated — a victim for the first time.Ventrell-Monsees noted that that’s often the case. She said the emotional trauma of age discrimination is often more severe than what comes from racist or sexist discrimination. It may just be, she said, that “minority workers or women are [just more] used to it happening.”Sandstrom’s case, which is profiled on the EEOC’s website,was settledfor $24,000 in damages — and the Maui County’s agreement to monitor the police department’s compliance with federal age discrimination laws.For his part, Sandstrom urges older workers to “not look the other way. You should not ignore it. You should not accept it. You should ask for and pursue justice.”Ventrell-Monsees said that in some cases, large damage awards have been given by juries only to be reduced by judges.One glaring example of that is a case against aerospace and defense contractor Lockheed Martin, which saw one of the largest verdicts ever awarded to a single plaintiff in the history of age discrimination litigation.Plaintiff Robert Braden was employed by Lockheed Martin and its predecessors for almost 30 years before he was fired during a round of company layoffs in 2012. He was 66 at the time, and sued Lockheed Martin, claiming age discrimination under theNew Jersey Law Against Discrimination(NJLAD) and theAge Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967(ADEA).After a four-day trial, thejury awarded himmore than $51 million, $50 million of which was in punitive damages that a federal judge later ruled was “excessive.” A retrial would be required to determine how much, if anything, the company should pay to deter such misconduct in the future.While not speaking to this case in specific, Ventrell-Monsees noted that “the people (on juries) get it,” and added that “it’s judges with lifetime appointments who don’t always get it.”","What happens to those people who don’t just limit their stories about age discrimination to the friendly ears at the proverbial water cooler and instead actually attempt to seek enforcement of the protections they are entitled to under federal and state law?Is it worth the stress and aggravation of filing a complaint with the EEOC?Most of those who fought back against age discrimination in the workplace would say yes, it was worth it, according to Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, senior advisor to the chair of the EEOC and who, for 13 years, directed the age discrimination litigation program at AARP.Ventrell-Monsees said that the number of complaints by older workers who were put out to pasture prematurely or passed over for jobs has certainly increased — and so have the amounts for damages that juries have dinged companies who practice age discrimination.But, from her days as a litigator of age discrimination cases, she said, she rarely found a plaintiff “who was in it for the money.” Rather, she said, “most want to correct the wrong.”That seeking of social justice was what prompted Julianne Taaffe and Kathryn Moon tosue Ohio State Universityin 2015, a case that was settled last May when the two educators were awarded $765,000 in back pay. The bigger win though, may have been that the university agreed to review its policies for preventing and investigating age discrimination.As Jeff Vardaro of the Gittes Law Group that was part of their legal team said, “Julie and Kathy were committed throughout this process to achieving change that will prevent the same thing from happening again to them or their peers.”The two women insisted on a settlement that included effective, in-depth training and a top-to-bottom review of OSU’s discrimination investigation policies, Vardaro said. At the time of the settlement, attorney Fred Gittes called the case “remarkable” both for the “shocking” nature of the harassment and because Ohio State was committed to “fixing a system that’s really clearly broken,” he said.According tothe suit, Moon, who was 64 when the complaint was filed, had worked as an ESL instructor for 31 years at the university. Taaffe, who was 59 at the time, had worked there for more than 20 years.

",12/4/2021,How to Land a Great Job When You Are Over 50,"When I recently found myself unemployed and looking for work — a position familiar to many — I knew it wasn’t the best time to be job hunting.

",7/10/2020,That Time I Ran a Personal Ad in a Literary Journal,"I’m trying. I’m not giving up. I know I’m on Medicare (just joined) and closer to my death than my birth. I’ve spent more time living alone than being with someone. But I’m working on it. I’m working on finding someone by using all the possibilities out there — OkCupid, Tinder, Bumble, Match and now theNew York Review of Books. And it’s all because I bumped into someone I went to college with back in the 1970s, Bob, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.Bob was walking with his wife behind his son’s hospital bed as they were wheeling him down the hall. I had just finished speaking with my brother’s back surgeon when I spotted them. At the time, Bob’s boy looked healthy, as did my brother. They were both just diagnosed with metastatic cancer.After that, Bob and I stayed in touch, wanting to know how each of our loved ones was doing. It was on Facebook where I discovered his son lost his battle. My brother was still in the ring at that time.As we had a few things in common, Bob suggested we have dinner — and so we did. Bob had retired from a business he founded and ran with his wife. They sold it for millions. As I updated him on my life, Bob’s ears perked up when I told him I was still single. He didn’t seem to care much about my work career but was concerned that I was alone.Having been married for many years, Bob was clearly a great advocate of having a partner. And so I did what many people have advised me to: ask if he had any single friends. “I don’t,” he responded. “But I do have a suggestion. Why don’t you run an ad in theNew York Review of Books?”Before I could respond, Bob continued, “I subscribe to the paper and will send you the personals page.”He did just that. And, indeed, there were ads. Only one was from a man looking for a woman. He described himself as a New York City attorney, well read and well traveled, vigorous, eclectic, a good listener. He was seeking a woman to share the adventure. He wasseeking “femmes francophones appréciées”(francophone women appreciated).Although I am not a francophone, I am a francophile, and was soon headed back to France for a vacation. I decided to write him.“Appreciated your personal ad. I, too, enjoy reading and am well traveled. What’s important for me is communication. Moved by your words that you’re a good listener.”Although other ads had email addresses, this attorney only included a mailing address. I printed a few photos of myself and slipped them in the envelope with my letter.Nothing came of it. And so nearly a year later, I was ready to take Bob’s advice and run an ad of my own in theNew York Review of Books. As someone who relishes reading, smarts and worldliness, I was sure this publication had the perfect audience and that Mr. Right would finally find me.I gave myself a budget to work with. As it cost $5.85 per word, I made my ad short and sweet. This past Feb. 28, I was surprised to receive an email from a potential suitor. As I began reading, I kept thinking that perhaps I’ve finally found my soul mate. He was well educated, in his late 50s, living in Philadelphia but willing to relocate. He was a lawyer and writer, fit and well dressed.He wrote: “I’m mature and sophisticated, sweet-tempered, tenderhearted, devoted, and sexy. Very passionate, very romantic. I’m supportive, loyal and mature. I always ensure my partner is well cared for. I am neither jealous nor controlling. I’m empathetic and feel others’ emotions.”It all sounded so good until I read this: “I love being nursed, and being changed. Means the world to me, and the bonding is incomparable.”Being changed? When I questioned him about this he indicated he was AB/DL, which I immediately looked up. It stands for adult baby and diaper lover. I had never heard of this. He elaborated by writing, “My needing and wearing diapers is partly fetishistic, partly out of physical need, and partly out of emotional need.”When I wrote back to say that I was not “into changing” diapers, he snapped back that I had hurt his feelings and typed “blocked.” Others wrote, but not many, as COVID-19 hit and events were canceled and we were all sheltering in place. The few emails that did come were from men who proved not to be a match. Why? No one else shared a fetish with me. But no one interested me.Today I wonder why men in their 80s respond to an ad that says I’m looking for someone in their 50s or 60s. At this rate, I might be doing the same at that age. I wonder if I’ve become so set in my ways that I have little tolerance for another’s fetishes. Or have I just not found my match? The jury is out. Stay tuned.","I’m trying. I’m not giving up. I know I’m on Medicare (just joined) and closer to my death than my birth. I’ve spent more time living alone than being with someone.

",21-02-2022,I Admit it. I'm Retired and Have Started to Feel Irrelevant,"I recently rescued a dying plant from the clearance rack at my local garden store. It was marked $1, but the nice cashier charged me only 25 cents when he saw the pathetic specimen. And, yes, I dropped another $40 to buy the plant a pot with better drainage, some fresh potting soil, fertilizer and a big bottle of Neem oil.The thing is, Ihadto buy this plant (and all its rescue accoutrements) because I am determined to save it. I want to watch it flourish and bloom, as I’m sure it did once upon a time ago, perhaps when it was just a seedling and the world saw its potential.Why do I have such a burning need to rescue a plant? I think it’s because I am retired and have started to feel irrelevant.I had a high-energy 40-year career as a journalist trying to make a difference, hoping to right wrongs, effect change where I could and hold the rich and famous accountable for whatever they did to those who weren’t just like them. There was no injustice too small for me not to want to fix it. And now? Now there is a vast emptiness where my relevance used to live.For me, it is at the core of what’s wrong with being retired. Sure, I know how to keep busy and I enjoy my midday naps as much as the next retiree. But I would be lying if I didn’t admit that I simply don’t matter as much as I once did. I see how my opinions are given less weight — if they are even sought at all. My contributions make less of an impact. I don’t feel necessary or, on many days, that I even have a purpose.As a journalist, I spent a lifetime hoping to make the world a better place. Today, going to the supermarket is the focal point of my day. See what I mean? Staying relevant, to me, means feeling connected across generations to the news of the world and being in a position to help others in a meaningful way. It means I live my life in a manner that bestows value to it. I want it to matter that I still occupy space on this planet.Doesn’t everyone want that? And if they are retired, how do they get that sense of purpose? So, yes, I still want to be seen, to be counted. And truth be told, I miss feeling current — the kind of hip awareness that can come only from having younger people in your life. Our culture is rapidly changing, and despite being a voracious reader, I feel some days like the world is charging forward without me.I don’t want to be the last person alive to understand why pronouns matter so much or that TikTok tweens and K-pop fans are a clever and growing force to be reckoned with on the world political stage.I am very aware that to some people this essay will sound like a frivolous whine. After all, I’m in good health and am financially comfortable, and many other people my age can’t say the same. But the problem is that when we prepare for our retirement, the bulk of the planning focuses on just those two factors — health and wealth — and very little thought is given to the emotional adjustment required when we step off the playing field and move to the sidelines.I fear that I left my relevance back on the field. I am apparently not alone in this. A Transamerica retirement study in 2017 found that 97 percent of retirees who said they were happy also said they still had a strong sense of purpose. And, in a nutshell, that’s what’s missing from mine.Let’s face it: Only the diehards want to play golf or go fishing every day. Sure, it’s nice to be free of the daily grind and the constant exhausting effort it took to juggle family and work. No, I do not miss the rat race. Volunteering, I’m told, isn’t a bad route to take if it satisfies your itch. Sure, we all could get more involved in our communities: work for elected officials who share our agendas, deliver meals and cheerful banter to shut-ins, join the ranks of those who read to children, walk shelter dogs or clean up the beaches and hiking trails from the slobs who leave it a mess.But some of us are too impatient for any of those things and/or don’t want to be a small cog in the big wheel. (And personally speaking, I have yet to meet a charity-thrift-store volunteer who wasn’t there primarily to get first dibs on the good donated stuff.)Without question, the world still needs improvement — and so do I. My pledge to myself in this new year is to fill the hole in my life that retirement created. Anyone can stay busy, but not everyone can stay relevant. I’m going to stick to writing to make a difference and have dusted off my old book proposal in the hope of finding an agent. And clearly, it’s not a minute too soon: Sadly, the plant has died.","I recently rescued a dying plant from the clearance rack at my local garden store.

I see how my opinions are given less weight — if they are even sought at all. My contributions make less of an impact. I don’t feel necessary or, on many days, that I even have a purpose.As a journalist, I spent a lifetime hoping to make the world a better place. Today, going to the supermarket is the focal point of my day. See what I mean? Staying relevant, to me, means feeling connected across generations to the news of the world and being in a position to help others in a meaningful way. It means I live my life in a manner that bestows value to it. I want it to matter that I still occupy space on this planet.Doesn’t everyone want that? And if they are retired, how do they get that sense of purpose? So, yes, I still want to be seen, to be counted. And truth be told, I miss feeling current — the kind of hip awareness that can come only from having younger people in your life. Our culture is rapidly changing, and despite being a voracious reader, I feel some days like the world is charging forward without me.I don’t want to be the last person alive to understand why pronouns matter so much or that TikTok tweens and K-pop fans are a clever and growing force to be reckoned with on the world political stage.I am very aware that to some people this essay will sound like a frivolous whine. After all, I’m in good health and am financially comfortable, and many other people my age can’t say the same. But the problem is that when we prepare for our retirement, the bulk of the planning focuses on just those two factors — health and wealth — and very little thought is given to the emotional adjustment required when we step off the playing field and move to the sidelines.I fear that I left my relevance back on the field. I am apparently not alone in this. A Transamerica retirement study in 2017 found that 97 percent of retirees who said they were happy also said they still had a strong sense of purpose. And, in a nutshell, that’s what’s missing from mine.Let’s face it: Only the diehards want to play golf or go fishing every day. Sure, it’s nice to be free of the daily grind and the constant exhausting effort it took to juggle family and work. No, I do not miss the rat race. Volunteering, I’m told, isn’t a bad route to take if it satisfies your itch. Sure, we all could get more involved in our communities: work for elected officials who share our agendas, deliver meals and cheerful banter to shut-ins, join the ranks of those who read to children, walk shelter dogs or clean up the beaches and hiking trails from the slobs who leave it a mess.But some of us are too impatient for any of those things and/or don’t want to be a small cog in the big wheel. (And personally speaking, I have yet to meet a charity-thrift-store volunteer who wasn’t there primarily to get first dibs on the good donated stuff.)Without question, the world still needs improvement — and so do I. My pledge to myself in this new year is to fill the hole in my life that retirement created. Anyone can stay busy, but not everyone can stay relevant. I’m going to stick to writing to make a difference and have dusted off my old book proposal in the hope of finding an agent. And clearly, it’s not a minute too soon: Sadly, the plant has died."

",8/7/2020,It's Time to Stop Using the Term 'Senior Citizen',"On a recent visit to a local big box store, I needed assistance to find an electronics item for my son. The young adult behind the counter wasn't able to help with my request and he told me he'd find a manager to assist me. As I waited and browsed an aisle away, I saw the manager arrive to the service desk. He asked who needed help and I heard the salesman say, “That older lady over there,” while pointing toward me.""That older lady over there” immediately realized I was living in the moment that I knew would come eventually: that moment when society saw me in an older state than I feel. That moment when my outward appearance didn't match my inward feelings of youthfulness.And, like it or not, that moment when you go from a “miss” to a “ma'am” happens to all of us.Sure, the argument can be made that someone is always going to be the oldest in the room and we are all older than someone, but the fact is, these days those who are 50-plus are no longer willing to be identified as “senior citizens.” In fact, most of us would agree that the only time we were excited to be called “senior” was when we were graduating from high school and college. Back then, being a senior meant we ruled the school. Nowadays, “senior citizen” conjures images of nursing homes, walkers and dentures.When I was growing up, I used to dream of spending my retirement years living my best life in Florida with my three best friends, like the characters from “The Golden Girls.” I wanted a lanai and I wanted to speak my mind like Estelle Getty's character, Sophia. But, now that retirement is looming in the not so distant future, I realize that I don't want to be seen “old” or “golden” any time soon. I still want to live in Florida, though.Now that I'm marching toward my 50s and beyond, the word “senior” makes my toes curl. Sure, I want the discounts that come with my age but can't we find a better way to define our generation? Can we all agree that it's time to freshen up the lingo for those over 50? And, the last time I checked, I'm a long way from dentures so you can miss me with the word “aged.""And I'm not alone in my desire to avoid being described as “geriatric” some day.There's a movement across the U.S. to update the language used to identify those in our population who are no longer spring chickens, if you will.Words like “senior citizen, “elderly” and “geriatric” are being kicked to the curb because the over-50 set is demanding to be identified in the way that they actually feel: vibrant and productive. “Old fart,” “codger” and “Q-tip” have largely been abandoned, thank goodness.But, what are the words we should use instead? What should replace terms like “aging communities” and “in their golden years""?Gen Xers and boomers have been so vocal in their revolt againstageist termsthat theAMA Manual of Stylehas corrected the preferred word usage when referring to older people. The manual states that while “elderly” can still be used to describe an issue specific to that population of people, “Terms such as older persons, older people, elderly patients, geriatric patients, older adults, older patients, aging adults, persons 65 years and older, or the older population are preferred.""The Journal of the American Geriatrics Society has changed its lingo, too. In aneditorial post in June 2017, the editors stated, “As a result, despite years of progress in our own understanding of aging, public perceptions are still mired in a ‘swamp’ that treats aging as undesirable. The public associates aging almost exclusively with decline and deterioration.""So, basically, it's the wild Wild West out there and it's up to us to start a revolution. Some are switching to “older people""; others are going with “olders.” Maureen Connors, a retail consultant in San Francisco recentlytold the Boston Globethat she's coined the term “perennials” as a play on “millennials.”When my son was small, I referred to him as “threenager” so I don't see any reason why we can't throw “third-ager” into the mix. However, I'm hoping to live into my “fourth-ager” and “fifth-ager” years, so that might get confusing. For now, I'm going to start telling people that I'm “chronologically superior” and see if that catches on.","On a recent visit to a local big box store, I needed assistance to find an electronics item for my son.

62,"https://www.aarpethel.com/ageism/heres-the-real-reason-older-women-dont-want-to-be-invisible
",8/7/2020,Here's the Real Reason Older Women Don't Want to Be Invisible,"I have a special superpower: I am invisible. I am a 69-year-old woman and didn't discover that I had this “gift” until I was in my early 50s.Lots of women know precisely what I'm talking about. As they age, they feel increasingly unseen — marginalized by the younger, the newer, the fresher fruit in the basket. I'd opine that at the core of this phenomenon is an overall broader lack of respect for the elderly except that many older men seem to stay visible pretty much all the way down the Depends aisle. Women? Not so much. And I suspect it's a contributing factor as to why more older women than men live in poverty, which the National Institute on Retirement Security says we do in spades.After all, if we aren't being seen, we aren't being hired, promoted, given raises, or valued.Invisibility hurts, and not just our feelings. When younger people can't see me, they behave as if I no longer have anything worthwhile to contribute to civilization as they know it. Yeah, that part gets old fast. I remember when, at age 59 and newly unemployed, I went on a job interview to be the marketing director for a startup in Santa Monica, California. With my hair freshly coiffed and wearing my best interview suit, I climbed the three flights of steps up to the “office” and knocked on the door. I knew from the minute the door opened that I wasn't who this company wanted. The young woman hiring manager asked me where I saw myself in five years, and I bit my tongue so as not to blurt out “dead with my ashes scattered at sea.” On the way down the three flights of steps, I kicked off the stilettos and knew I would never hear from that company again. All they seemed to see was someone older than their mothers. They appeared blind to my abilities.Invisibility doesn't just mean that as a woman I can now walk past the construction site at the corner and no longer be subjected to catcalls and whistles. (And a pox on the head of any person who ever thought that felt good or took it as a compliment.)No, invisibility cloaks my ability to be validated in meaningful ways. Instead of seeing me for who I am, younger people make broad — and often false — assumptions about my skills, my institutional knowledge and pretty much everything else that I can bring to the table.Remember the highly identifiableepisode ofGrace & Frankiewhen the duo fails to get a sales clerk's attention as they try to buy a pack of cigarettes? Instead of waiting on them, the clerk provides service to a younger woman who waltzed in after them and asks for lottery tickets. Grace's meltdown is replete with the anger and language of the invisible. “Do you not see me???” she beseeches the clerk.Bingo. No Grace, he does not see you, even though you have accomplished more than many as a successful business person, community leader and mother. Your indignation is righteous; your hurt feelings, justifiable. We have all been there. And we applaud Frankie's revenge — pinching the pack of cigarettes because, as previously noted, being invisible does have some upsides.Another upside are my feet, which personally walked their last pair of heels to the trash bin and have been much more pleasant to be around since I became invisible. No one sees the clodhopper sneakers on them or notices that giving up pedicures is a seriously great way to save money.Here's the thing: As long as appearance is the yardstick used to measure a woman's value, older women will get the short end of it. Blame Hollywood for often portraying older women in an unflattering manner; blame our beauty-is-defined-by-youth culture for leaving us out; blame the entire cottage industry that exists because it convinced us that the only way to age gracefully was to actually not age at all. Aging gracefully is just a marketing slogan to sell us products that fuel the hope that we can become visible again. I'm not buying any of it, literally.Here's a crazy idea: Let's flip the script on older people, especially women. Instead of looking for the nearest pasture to send us out to graze with our knitting needles, why not offer us some respect? Instead of pushing us aside, make room for us at the table and hear our thoughts.If, for no other reason, the surest way to make money going forward will be to figure out what boomers are going to need for the next 20 or so years and then produce it. And you need us to tell you what those things are. I would start with “stop treating me like I'm invisible.” A pair of stylish comfortable shoes wouldn't be bad either.","I have a special superpower: I am invisible.

The two are beaming, holding a strip of ultrasound photos and a sign that says, “Made with lots of love…and a little bit of science.”On the left, joining hands with Breanna, is their gestational surrogate, Julie Loving.

But when followers of Breanna’s@ivf.surrogacy.diaryread the caption, they’re treated to a jaw-dropping surprise:“[T]his little miracle’s carrier is quite a special one. MY MOM. My mom will be carrying and delivering our baby!”The story of how Julie, 51, became one of the few women nationwide to carry her own grandchild via gestational surrogacy starts with heartache and hundreds of injections. Breanna, a dental hygienist, and Aaron, who works in computer network security, tried to conceive for nearly four years, enduring eight IVF attempts and multiple miscarriages. After the Manteno, Illinois, couple suffered the loss of twins and Breanna underwent a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove tissue from inside the uterus, she was diagnosed with Asherman syndrome, a rare condition in which scar tissue forms inside the uterus, rendering conception extremely difficult.After the Lockwoods received this devastating news, infertility specialistBrian Kaplan, M.D.,of Fertility Centers of Illinois, mentioned gestational surrogacy as an option. In this situation, the surrogate carries an embryo created with someone else’s egg and sperm.“I started looking into it,” Breanna says, “but there was a big sticker shock. It’s not covered by insurance and costs upward of $100,000, $150,000 to go through an agency.” Her fertility doctor mentioned that those costs can be significantly reduced if a family member or friend serves as a surrogate, but no one sprung to Breanna’s mind. “I don’t have any sisters, and my friends have had complicated pregnancies,” she explains.That’s when Breanna’s mom started thinking about the possibility of filling the role. “When she lost her twins, I said to my husband, ‘I would be her surrogate,’ ” Julie says. “I’m healthy. I feel like I’m in my 30s. My two pregnancies, including a 9.5-pound son, were easy.”Julie is also a two-time Boston marathon finisher (2016 and 2018) who’s in incredible shape. (She first took up running in her 40s, “when I moved off to college when they became empty nesters,” Breanna writes on an Instagram post dedicated to her mom. “Some people just get a puppy; my parents decided they wanted to qualify for Boston.”Julie texted Breanna, “Give me a chance. Let me be your surrogate.” Breanna’s answer? A hard no. “I didn’t think it was possible. I thought I’d be shut down by the doctor, and I was afraid to even mentally get on board with [the idea],” Breanna explains. She was also concerned about the health ramifications of a 51-year-old woman carrying and delivering a baby. (Julie says her daughter’s exact words were, “Mom, no. You’re crazy. You’re old.”)But Julie kept at it. “I purely wanted to help my daughter,” she reveals. “I was on this ride with her, experiencing her losses, her hurt. And as parents, we felt helpless.”Breanna started to get annoyed, complaining to her colleagues, “My mom will not stop.” But they thought she should do it. “They said, ‘Give her a try.’ But I was worried about my mom. And you put a lot of work into creating these embryos. These embryos are gold. You want to put them somewhere they’ll thrive.”In July of 2019, Julie accompanied her daughter to a routine fertility appointment. As they walked in, Breanna whispered to her mom, “Donotsay anything about being a surrogate—donot.” But her mom didn’t listen. And much to Breanna’s surprise, Dr. Kaplan responded positively. The notion that he even thought it might be an option made Breanna reconsider.What followed was a half year of consultations and tests. Julie needed to be cleared by her primary physician, a high-risk ob-gyn, a psychologist and more specialists. She passed all the tests with flying colors. Interestingly, one of them revealed that Julie was postmenopausal, which came as a shock to her considering she hadn’t experienced traditional symptoms like hot flashes. But, fortunately, menopause doesn’t necessarily matter when you’re a surrogate.This past February, one of Breanna and Aaron’s embryos was implanted in Julie. Another was transferred into Breanna herself on the same day, a sort of last-hurrah effort to see if it might stick. A little over a week later, Breanna and her mom took home-pregnancy tests together. Both tests were positive, so for a moment it seemed as if mother and daughter would be pregnant together. Sadly, Breanna’s ended up being an ectopic pregnancy, meaning the embryo implanted in her fallopian tube and was not viable. But mom’s stuck.For Julie, pregnancy is a bit different this time around. Now she’s enjoying “cute, fitted maternity clothes. …We used to wear our stuff really baggy back in the 90s.” Aside from some first-trimester nausea and fatigue, she feels great, walking 2 to 3 miles a day. “Now that I can feel the baby kicking,” she says, “it’s really bringing back the memories.”COVID-19 has certainly thrown wrenches into their plans, but, fortunately, Breanna has been able to join Julie for nearly every prenatal appointment. (When she can’t, Julie FaceTimes her in.) Friends and family, including Breanna’s dad/Julie’s husband, are all supportive.Baby Lockwood, a girl, is due in November. While Breanna and Aaron haven’t decided on her first name, they know that her middle name will be Juliette, in honor of her grandma. Mother and daughter recently attended a 3D ultrasound together, where they were treated to images of the baby’s face, fingers and toes. When Breanna burst into tears, Julie jumped into mom mode, rubbing her back and embracing her with love. “Forever there for her babies,” Breanna says, “just like I plan to be.”","There are three people featured in Breanna Lockwood’s Instagram baby announcement. On the right stands Breanna, 29, and her husband, Aaron. The two are beaming, holding a strip of ultrasound photos and a sign that says, “Made with lots of love…and a little bit of science.”On the left, joining hands with Breanna, is their gestational surrogate, Julie Loving. Wearing a formfitting dress that perfectly hugs her bump, Julie, at first glance, looks like she could be Breanna’s sister.

",21-06-2021,How 'Seinfeld' Changed My Life,"My agent called one day to tell me about an audition for a few lines on a new sitcom. A better-known actress had turned down the role, saying it was too small for her. In Hollywood the general rule is “Don't ever accept a job as a bit player, because then you will always be stuck in that category.” Self-respect was not a luxury I could afford, so I went in and got the job. OnSeinfeld!When the show aired, my husband, Benni, didn’t get it.“It’s not about anything,”he said.How right he was. My few lines turned into the recurring character of Doris Klompus, a neighbor at Jerry’s parents’ Florida condo complex. My TV husband, Jack Klompus, was always fighting with Jerry’s father.I’m in some of the classic episodes: “The Pen,” “The Cadillac,” “ Raincoats.” My role was so minor that the audience didn’t even notice when I played a second character: the obnoxious lady sitting next to Elaine on an airplane. I can be pretty blunt in real life, so the nagging wife and the busybody passenger were easy fits.The atmosphere on the set was very New York Jewish. There were always containers of Chinese takeout lying around, and on the first day of the Jewish New Year, Jerry was very concerned about getting to temple on time for services.Jerry is known for being very loyal to his friends, and I saw proof of that one day when he anxiously checked his messages every half hour to get word on the pending birth of his buddy Larry Miller’s baby. Eventually, I got friendly with the cast — which mostly meant listening to stories about their sex lives — definitely my idea of a good time.Liz Sheridan, who played Jerry’s mom, told me about her affair with James Dean. Jason Alexander claimed to be the world’s best kisser. And Sandy Baron, who played my husband, shared every salacious detail about the time he was set up on a blind date with a woman who turned out to be actually blind. Best sex he ever had.One of my favorite actors was Jerry Stiller, who in real life was nothing at all like Frank Costanza. Jerry was a devoted family man and an accomplished Shakespearean actor. I once ran into him at a Chekhov play, and he awed me with an erudite analysis of the piece. Next, he posed the question that serious thespians have been asking one another since time began:“So? You workin’?”The sad truth was that I was still a mostly unemployed bit player — until the day I realized that I was sort of famous. I was at a party and met one of thoseSeinfeldfanatics who watches every re-run. Not only did he know who both my insignificant characters were, but he could quote all of my insignificant lines. Another guest was impressed, even though it was clear that she’d never seen the show.“You were onSteinfield? Could I get an autograph for my nephew?”Then I went to Australia to perform one of my solo shows and the newspaper headline said, “Seinfeldactress coming to Sydney!”We have a friend who is a Major Hollywood Player. This guy was so uninterested in me that he introduced me as an afterthought: “Oh, and this is Benni’s wife.”We were eating with him in a showbiz deli, which means that I chewed my brisket in silence while Mr. Hollywood spoke exclusively to my husband. Suddenly I spotted someone waving at me and calling my name. I went over, and it was Jerry, who — nice guy that he is — just wanted to say hello. Everyone in the restaurant stared, and I could sense them thinking,Who is that woman schmoozing with Jerry Seinfeld? She must be Somebody.When I returned to our table, Mr. Hollywood began to include me in the conversation. He now introduces me by saying, “And this is my very dear friend Annie Korzen. You’ve probably seen her onSeinfeld.”Now comes the bad news. At first, I was pretty comfortable with Jerry andSeinfeldcocreator and head writer Larry David. Then the show became a global phenomenon, and I got intimidated by their fame. They hadn’t really changed, but I became shy and awkward in their presence. When most people get shy and awkward, they get tongue-tied. I have the opposite reaction: I get tongue-untied and can’t stop chattering. Each time I ran into them, I launched into a crazed, desperate, nonstop, inappropriate monologue. My brain would say, “Shut your stupid mouth — you are making a gigantic ass of yourself.”But I just yammered on, even though I saw the glazed look in their eyes. Two men I admire now probably think I’m a total nutcase, but I’m still glad I took the job.I sometimes think about the actress who turned down the role because it was too small. It certainly was. I had only a few lines in each of four episodes. But those tiny residual checks keep trickling in, and over the years,Seinfeldhas earned me well over $80,000. Plus, my association with the show — however modest — has opened all kinds of doors for me.When I pitched a humorous essay to the venerableNew York Times,the editor wrote back immediately that he wanted the piece. The very next thing he said was, “So, tell me — what was it like to work onSeinfeld?”Igot really lucky here because no one could have possibly predicted this sitcom’s spectacular success. After all, the characters are, for the most part, whiny, dishonest and manipulative.Why would we want to spend time with these shallow fools?I think I know the answer. We all want to be accepted for who we are, and that’s what Jerry and George and Elaine and Kramer provide. No matter what crazy-ass things they say to each other, no matter what crazy-ass things they do to each other, they always just let it go and move on: They forgive and forget — which is how we should treat people we love. So, the TV show that’s “not about anything” is really about a big, fat F-word called Family, and I will be forever grateful that I got to be a part of that miracle.ANNIE KORZEN has written humorous essays for NPR’sMorning Edition, The New York Times,Los Angeles Timesand many other media outlets.  She has performed her solo shows on three continents and is a Moth Mainstage storyteller.

",7/10/2020,I Fired My Boss and Quit My Job,"The phone meeting with my boss and the new agency we hired didn’t go well. Understatement.As soon as the meeting was over, my boss, let’s call her “B,” called to offer me some feedback. I had put in a little over a year at this job and felt like I was getting nothing but feedback.My colleagues got their fair share, too, but they seemed more Teflon-coated than me. In truth, I rarely saw B, who traveled 85 percent of the time. Yet I was developing a severe allergic reaction to our interactions. I had three choices — to glean how to meet her expectations, grow a thicker skin or get a new job — because the constant criticism was wearing me down.The next day I arrived at the office early. My team was overdue giving feedback to a client on a project. We needed B’s approval before sending and had given it to her for review five days  earlier. Finally, that morning, she sent it back. I opened her email and started reading her notes.In bold, she listed eight things I had done correctly but 28 things that I had done wrong. Twenty-eight! My eyes started to swim with the demands that we were expected to pull off ... yesterday.I took a deep breath and hit print.Zsing,I could hear the printer start working down the hall. I scrolled down and down, and the email just kept going ... seven, eight, nine pages. I felt like a can of carbonated soda had been shaken up and cracked open inside of me. My head was going to explode.No paycheck was worth this. Right then and there I decided to fire my boss. That’s right. Give her a pink slip and replace her with a superior superior.So what if that technically meant I had to find a new job?Just then my colleague, whom I adore, appeared in my office with a dozen pink tulips. They were the fancy kind, with the double petals, and wrapped in brown butcher paper. Her arm was outstretched.“For you,” she said. “I heard yesterday’s meeting was rough.”Zsing, the printer continued. “Do you hear that?” I asked her.Zsing. “That’s the printer,” I continued. “B wants us to do 28 things before we can get back to the client.""My colleague’s jaw dropped.Zsing, zsing, zsing, the printer continued its death march of helpful hints.“I’m quitting,” I told my colleague.She nodded sympathetically. We looked at each other for a moment.Zsing.And then quiet. That printer must have been exhausted.“I’ll close your door,” she said, backing out.I picked up the phone and dialed my boss. B answered chirpily, with forced cheer. She must have known I was calling about the 28-pointer.“I’m calling to resign,” I said. “I don’t think I’m a good fit for this job.”“OK,” she said in a high voice.“OK?” I repeated, taken aback. “Is this what you wanted?”“No,” she said, her voice still higher than usual.Was she for real? I had a junior high school flashback of when a boyfriend manipulated me into breaking up with him, because he was too chicken to do it himself. B and I then started bickering about what would and would not be possible to accomplish in a single day.“I was trying to help you, but I guess it’s not coming across in that way,” she said. We made an agreement to speak later in the day about a mutually beneficial end date. I would be the third departure within a month, which didn’t look good for the organization, and I didn’t have a job lined up, which wasn’t optimal for me. So, there were advantages to make this a “conscious uncoupling,” to borrow Gwyneth Paltrow’s divorce euphemism.We hung up. All joking aside, this felt very much like a breakup. I respected my boss, but we had irreconcilable creative differences about management and motivation.Once the tingling in my body started to dissipate, I tried to catalog my emotions. First of all, shock and awe. Quitting had not been on that day’s to-do List. I was disappointed to not be able to carry out the complicated reorg that had recently won board approval. Also, I loved my team and would miss them.Another part of me felt defeated. A born pleaser, I had become adept over the years about intuiting a boss’s needs, and yet I was unable to crack B’s code. Was I losing my touch?Still, an exhilarating relief was rising within me. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. I was never going to change B. And to be fair, maybe B didn’t need changing. She was the boss, and it was her prerogative to treat people as she liked. But I had to admit, the premise of finding a leader who would appreciate my skills, experience and ideas filled me with giddy hope.The last time I fired my boss, it was world-rocking. After years of being judged by my inner critic, I finally woke up to the self-flagellation and sent her packing. Thanks to years of therapy, solid girlfriends, and even my yoga and meditation practices, I slowly but surely learned how to switch the voice in my mind from harsh to encouraging. Amazingly, it enabled me to accomplish even more.Little did I know, however, that the coronavirus would strike the following week. The country would head into the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Unemployment rates would soar to unprecedented heights. Finding any new boss was suddenly a daunting prospect.And still, I’ve had no regrets. Sometimes, you just have to take a leap of faith.","The phone meeting with my boss and the new agency we hired didn’t go well.

I was never going to change B. And to be fair, maybe B didn’t need changing. She was the boss, and it was her prerogative to treat people as she liked. But I had to admit, the premise of finding a leader who would appreciate my skills, experience and ideas filled me with giddy hope.The last time I fired my boss, it was world-rocking. After years of being judged by my inner critic, I finally woke up to the self-flagellation and sent her packing. Thanks to years of therapy, solid girlfriends, and even my yoga and meditation practices, I slowly but surely learned how to switch the voice in my mind from harsh to encouraging. Amazingly, it enabled me to accomplish even more.Little did I know, however, that the coronavirus would strike the following week. The country would head into the worst economic recession since the Great Depression. Unemployment rates would soar to unprecedented heights. Finding any new boss was suddenly a daunting prospect.And still, I’ve had no regrets. Sometimes, you just have to take a leap of faith."

",1/9/2020,I’m 56 and My Partner Is 68. Here Are the Challenges We Face,"A May-December romance: when two people with a considerable age difference are romantically involved. Sure, there are many considerations when one engages in this type of relationship, but it’s important to realize that an age gap in one’s 20s or 30s varies markedly from that same gap later in life.Oddly enough, there is an actual definition of what constitutes a May-December romance. According to Psychology Today, divide your age by 2 and add 7. This gives you the minimum “acceptable” age difference between two romantic partners. So, if I’m 40, I “shouldn’t” date anyone younger than 27. Kind of like the dog-years formula for human relationships.In my personal situation, I am 56 and my significant other is 68 — 12 or sometimes 13 years apart. Let’s do the math. Yup, we’re technically okay but I’m not sure I agree that being a 68-year-old partnered with a 41-year-old doesn’t come with some very real challenges. And there’s also a difference, I contend, between a large age gap when you’re younger and when you’re older.Retirement is one of the most obvious differences in that my SO is retired while I am not. So, there are times when he wants to do something fun, travel or just be spontaneous and I can’t because of work constraints. Taking that a step further, even after work hours, I’m tired and have responsibilities to tend to that he has unlimited free time to tackle. And although he tries, it’s sometimes hard for him to understand when I need to vent about a horrible workday. And it’s equally hard sometimes for me to hear about what luxurious activity he’s been savoring.Health is perhaps the most significant difference with an age gap in the golden years. While I might be battling typical middle age health challenges — menopause, etc. — he is certainly facing more significant ones. Our levels of stamina differ, for sure. And sexual desire and ability disparities can be significant.There’s more. He’s lost more friends and therefore tends to rely on my company more. His children are in different phases of their lives from mine. The reality of planning for end-of-life arrangements seems to be more pressing. Our financial situations vary. He’s been exposed to a greater variety of life experiences and possesses the wisdom that comes with that. Even our sleeping patterns and eating habits are different. Patience is required as memory issues and the like arise.So, while age gaps come with their own consequences for the younger couples, from differing musical tastes to varying childhood experiences, the differences become more pronounced and significant later in life. Surely, the bigger the divide, the bigger the issues, and the older we get, the more obvious those differences will become.And, just for fun, if you want to do some quick calculations: Legendary songwriter David Foster and actress Katharine McPhee have a 34-year age difference; Dennis Quaid and his new wife sport a 39-year age chasm. Also — notice a trend here? Yup. The May is usually the woman, the December the man, but that’s a whole other story!So, while we can’t always help who we fall in love with, it’s important to be aware that age differences pose a whole new set of challenges later in life. Nonetheless, I say, follow your heart! Nothing in life is guaranteed, so enjoy that special someone regardless of your age.","A May-December romance: when two people with a considerable age difference are romantically involved.

ON EARTH. GOT INTO ME?The thought of me withered, needy, in a wheelchair, and eating pureed pears for dinner, that’s what.Perception Is Everything—and Means NothingI’m not alone. As it turns out, most Americans perceive aging as a negative thing. That perception takes root when we’re kids . . . and never leaves.An articlein theJournals of Gerontologyrevealed that the stereotypes that kids internalize about it absolutely “carry with them expectations about their own aging process. When asked how they would feel about becoming an elderly person, 60% of these children gave responses rated as negative, including ‘I would feel awful.’” A study quoted in the article found that “among children aged four to seven, 66% mentioned that they prefer not to become old.”Childhood is when this stereotype begins, but our culture reinforces the idea throughout our lives, and we continue to buy in. From the same article: “When individuals reach old age, the aging stereotypes internalized in childhood, and then reinforced for decades, become self-stereotypes.”In other words, you’ve become that old person you were frightened of becoming.But it doesn’t have to be that way.The truth is that even when Nana was in her 60s, and still had 40-plus years to live, she seemed old to me. That was partly because of her habit of wearing homemade “housecoats” and open-toed shoes regardless of the season, and partly because of her hair color. But mostly, because she was just, well, old-fashioned.If You Want to Live Longer, Think HappierI wish I understood then what I do now: She may have looked old, but she never felt old. She was too busy living.And that’s a good thing. According toBecca Levy, professor of public health (social and behavioral sciences) and psychology at Yale, you live longer if you have positive beliefs about aging. In fact,those who have negative beliefs die 7.5 years earlier than those who don’t.Experts say that if  you look at aging in a negative light even beginning in early adulthood, you’re more likely to develop major illnesses as early as your 60s.Illness? Nana didn’t even get cavities. Okay, that’s not strictly true—she got one (seriously: one), and had it filled when she was in her 90s.Could her longevity have been all in her genes? That might have had something to do with it.But I’m thinking it was mostly in her thinking. Here are some women who have found original ways to be positive about aging:Tell Yourself You’re 60 Before You AreFor me, around the eighth year of each decade, I think, in a resigned fashion, I’m 30, I’m 40, I’m 50. I may be resistant to “I’m 60,” but I have another year till I’m closing in on 58. The result is, by the time I actually do turn that age, I don’t really think about it too much.LouiseCelebrate Every MilestoneWhen I turned 30, I was sad that I wasn’t married, didn’t have children, and didn’t own a house. When I turned 40, I was glad I only owned a house. When I turned 50 and 60, I made them great celebrations—because that’s what they are! I like to think that I”m living my life to the fullest and will celebrate all these terrific milestones.SherrieLie About Your Age, in ReverseWhen I turned 59 all I could see was 60 right around the corner. How did that happen so fast? I knew I had to be in a “good place” by my 60th or it would be one of those soul-crushing milestones. Now I lie and tell people I’m 74...(even though I’m only 64)...it’s always good for an “OMG, you look fabulous” type of response.BarbaraHave Sex on the BeachI celebrated my 60th in New Zealand, swimming with dolphins and wondering if this was really me doing that. I’m not an enthusiastic traveler, but I really wanted to go far away and do something way out of my comfort zone. Did I fret about turning 60? Probably, but I was more excited about 60 than I was about 40 or 50. Even though I was away from family and friends for this big one, my husband and I have fond memories of sharing dinner with strangers who would become friends in the moment. I swam, I hiked on a glacier, had sex on the (deserted!) beach, saw the stars of the Southern Hemisphere, and was surrounded by beauty every single day. Not sure how to top that for the next big one, but I have a year and a half to think about it. But in light of current events, 70 will mean some serious evaluation and reflection. When does “old” really start? Are we there yet? Should I get another tattoo? Will I need another hip? Lots to think about.RisaThe Hardest Part Is the PartBeforeThe night before I turned 60, I called my older brother.“I can’t believe I’m turning 60,” I said.“The day before is torture,” he said. “You’ll feel better tomorrow.”I waited up until midnight. I didn’t feel any different. So I wondered what time, exactly, I was born. I called my mother, now well into her 80s, to ask. She couldn’t recall. “Maybe around 2 a.m.?”she said.I stayed up until 2 a.m.AfterIs a Piece of CakeAt 2 a.m., it was like New Year’s Eve.

I guess I needed something to prove I had control over my body.We are mortal. And mortals decline. But we don’t need to fear it. We just need to remind ourselves that we are mighty, we are stronger than we think, and, as long as we keep moving forward, we are lucky as hell to have the chance.","It’s All RelativeWhen I think of my age relative to my maternal grandmother’s when she passed away at 107, I’m good.When I think of it relative to the average lifespan of a woman in the U.S. — 81 years — I’m still good.So, with Nana as a role model for aging, why then was I anything butgoodin the years, days, and hours leading up to my 60th birthday?

",10/7/2020,I Don't Lament My Kids Growing Older,"Recently, I made my film debut. Well, sort of. My daughter is a first-year film student, and she asked me to act in her most recent movie. Although I am a mom of a film student, I had never before seen with my own eyes what making a movie entails. What I witnessed that day was eye-opening. My daughter was in charge of an entire set, managing every aspect of the production, from choreographing the actors’ movements to ensuring that the shoot stayed on schedule, given the limited time she had at that location. For half a day, Isaw my daughter not as my little girlwho once depended on me for her every need but as a grown woman capable of managing a film production from start to finish. Most notably, though, instead of my directing her, she was directing me.I should feel old.A week earlier, I had made a grueling five-hour drive to Boston and back, to visit the college that my second daughter will be attending in the fall. It meant that I now have two grown daughters andmy house will be much quieterthan it already is.I should feel old.My son, my baby, is starting high school in the fall, and, all of a sudden, he is taller than I and needs to learn how to shave soon.I should feel really old.But I don't. Instead, I feel invigorated. Yes, I have two grown children and a third almost grown, which would likely lead one to the conclusion that I am on the downswing. Perhaps, by the numbers, but psychologically, I feel young, even renewed. My children are in the midst of the most exciting, memorable time of their lives, and because I am there right alongside them, I get to share the memories they make. A product of growing older, it is the energy and thrill of these experiences that keep me from feeling old.Before participating in my daughter's film the other day, I hadn't done any acting since my sixth-grade elementary school play. Acting would not have been something I had ever thought to seek out at this point in my life (or ever), but my daughter offered me the opportunity to be in her film, and I accepted. As a result, I got to spend the day seeing her in action, doing what she loves. I received the blessing of seeing her smile when she filmed a scene just the way she wanted and radiate satisfaction and accomplishment after she wrapped for the day. We don't often think of emotions and feelings as being something we exude, but I have found that to be the case. I have absorbed the positivity and energy that my children radiate and now feel younger than I am.My daughter and I are also working on a project together. I had discussed with friends and family for years that I wanted to create a screenplay, but I never had the energy or patience to write one. I often thought of myself as aworking motherwho did not have another second to spare. That was until, one day, I approached my daughter and said I finally wanted to write that screenplay — with her. So, a couple of months ago, we sat down and began cowriting it, with the hope of producing it once we finish. Part of me never thought I would get to write that story, but my daughter influenced me to go for it, and now we are working together, mother and daughter, which is an even bigger, better dream.With my second daughter, whom I recently accompanied to Boston, I had the experience of waking up at 3:30 a.m. to make this trek, after which I spent the day touring the college she will be attending for the next four years. A mere seven hours later, I embarked on the long drive home. Driving 10 hours in one day is typically a feat that only a young person, not amiddle-aged womanlike me, would have the patience to endure. I felt mentally and physically drained, but the experience made me flash back to when I was my daughter's age and regularly did this drive to meet my then boyfriend, who, later, became my husband and the father of my children. And so, I felt young again, like time and age could not deter me from doing the things I once had done, just because nearly 30 years had passed. I still have it in me.I don't lament the fact that my children are growing older and the inevitability of my growing older. Instead, I am celebrating that I successfully raised (and am raising) three happy, responsible young adults. After all, running a production set by yourself is no minor feat, and being a part of my daughter's was an opportunity I am grateful to have experienced, even at my ripe “old” age of 46. Age, as it turns out, reflects simply the number of times the Earth has revolved around the sun since we were born. It is our mind, though, that defines the quality of our lives as the Earth keeps moving. The key to preserving our youth is, therefore,rejecting the notionthat aging means feeling deprived of energy, positivity and new experiences.

74,"https://www.aarpethel.com/fulfillment/a-man-explains-what-he-loves-most-about-women-over-60
",12/7/2021,A Man Explains What He Loves Most About Women Over 60 ,"A woman in her 60s looks at you differently. It’s not better or worse than the look one gets from a woman of any other age, it’s just … different. She’s a woman who has lived through much of the 20st century and all of the 21st century, and so she has seen, done, encountered, endured, been challenged by, luxuriated in, put up with and relished a whole hell of a lot.Six decades along, she no longer needs to apologize for, boast about, be dragged down by, wonder if or, really, put up with anything else.Not anymore. She is woman, and she has roared.That’s the backstory that powers the gleam from within that a man sees when he gets “the look” from a woman who is over 60. It is so in the moment and plainly expressed that it’s impossible to ignore or resist. If you’re working with her (or working for her), it commands respect without instilling fear — a neat trick that too few men, of any age, seem able to pull off.If you’re visiting her as a friend, “the look” understands you without patronizing you; she’s been patronized plenty enough over the years to know you have no use for that. And if you’re loving her, living with her, it simply welcomes you in. It’s able to absorb and comfort and excite you without resorting to guile.It’s straight up. It’s warm. It’s generous. It’s sexy.Our culture doesn’t celebrate these qualities nearly enough. In fact, it usually dismisses them. Hollywood has always had a hard time capturing women 60-plus except when it wraps them in the context of motherhood.I was reminded of this recently while watching the actress Frances McDormand do her amazing thing in the movieNomadland.I’ve been a fan of hers forever. It started in 1996, withFargo,the dark comedy in which she portrayed the hugely pregnant, doggedly plain-thinking police chief Marge Gunderson (“I guess,” she began her most iconic line, “that was your accomplice in the wood chipper.”)McDormand was in her late 30s then. Most of her screen time she spent bundled up against an arctic Minnesota winter in a heavy coat, outsized mittens and a big hat with ear flaps. She was in pursuit of two gruesomely bungling hit men and the small-potatoes car salesman who hired them.Yet the scene that stayed with me, and cemented my admiration for McDormand, had nothing to do with the murder Marge was charged with investigating. Instead, it was an almost throwaway scene of her in bed after a long day, talking about art on a three-cent stamp with her balding husband, Norm.You could already see by the inner light emanating from McDormand’s clear, round eyes that she was going to age well on-screen without ever worrying about aging – that one day she would possess “the look.” Fast-forward a quarter century. I’m sprawled on my living room couch one night with my wife, who is 60, streamingNomadlandon Netflix. McDormand dominates the screen with a stark depiction of aging on the edge. She plays Fern, a recession-scarred modern-day nomad roaming the American West while living in her DIY customized van.It’s a leading role but hardly a glam one. McDormand sports perhaps the best bad hair ever. Virtually everything she owns is secondhand.

Neither can the movie’s other characters, both women and men, including Dave, played by a smitten silver-haired David Strathairn.Why? “The look.” It glows with the understanding that Fern has been through it all, learned from it all and, finally, is at peace with it all. Fern’s circumstances hardly make her representative of older women. They’re too extreme. But the in-the-moment, plain-thinking visage that McDormand employs to portray her does represent the special beauty of the over-60 set. I see it every day when I wake up to my wife. So as soon as the final credits rolled, I googled McDormand’s age. So did my wife, also drawn by McDormand’s portrayal of something so singularly attractive. She beat me to it. McDormand is 63.Nomadlandis only a movie, of course, and McDormand was acting — sort of. She has long been outspoken about women aging, on-screen and off.“You are someone who, beneath that white hair, has a card catalog of valuable information,” she once said of older women. “I need to represent publicly what I’ve chosen to represent privately, which is a woman who is proud and more powerful than I was when I was younger. And I think that I can carry that pride and power on my face and in my body.”McDormand’s performance inNomadlandunderscored basic truths about the women in my life — my wife, my friends, my colleagues, the editor who assigned me this story — who are in their 60s and beyond.You can be elegant or frumpy or anything in between. You can touch up your hair, or you can let it go a gorgeous gray. You can work out and keep the pep in your step, or you can walk down the grocery store aisle with a little limp — fallout from that damn knee replacement. It doesn’t matter. You are 60. Give me “the look” and I still hear you roar.Photo credits: Benjamin Madgwick/August; Getty Images; Ari Michelson/Augustn(2); Stephanie Rausser/Trunk Archive","A woman in her 60s looks at you differently. It’s not better or worse than the look one gets from a woman of any other age, it’s just … different. She’s a woman who has lived through much of the 20st century and all of the 21st century, and so she has seen, done, encountered, endured, been challenged by, luxuriated in, put up with and relished a whole hell of a lot.Six decades along, she no longer needs to apologize for, boast about, be dragged down by, wonder if or, really, put up with anything else.Not anymore. She is woman, and she has roared.That’s the backstory that powers the gleam from within that a man sees when he gets “the look” from a woman who is over 60. It is so in the moment and plainly expressed that it’s impossible to ignore or resist. If you’re working with her (or working for her), it commands respect without instilling fear — a neat trick that too few men, of any age, seem able to pull off.If you’re visiting her as a friend, “the look” understands you without patronizing you; she’s been patronized plenty enough over the years to know you have no use for that. And if you’re loving her, living with her, it simply welcomes you in. It’s able to absorb and comfort and excite you without resorting to guile.It’s straight up. It’s warm. It’s generous. It’s sexy.Our culture doesn’t celebrate these qualities nearly enough. In fact, it usually dismisses them. Hollywood has always had a hard time capturing women 60-plus except when it wraps them in the context of motherhood.I was reminded of this recently while watching the actress Frances McDormand do her amazing thing in the movieNomadland.I’ve been a fan of hers forever. It started in 1996, withFargo,the dark comedy in which she portrayed the hugely pregnant, doggedly plain-thinking police chief Marge Gunderson (“I guess,” she began her most iconic line, “that was your accomplice in the wood chipper.”)McDormand was in her late 30s then. Most of her screen time she spent bundled up against an arctic Minnesota winter in a heavy coat, outsized mittens and a big hat with ear flaps. She was in pursuit of two gruesomely bungling hit men and the small-potatoes car salesman who hired them.Yet the scene that stayed with me, and cemented my admiration for McDormand, had nothing to do with the murder Marge was charged with investigating. Instead, it was an almost throwaway scene of her in bed after a long day, talking about art on a three-cent stamp with her balding husband, Norm.You could already see by the inner light emanating from McDormand’s clear, round eyes that she was going to age well on-screen without ever worrying about aging – that one day she would possess “the look.” Fast-forward a quarter century. I’m sprawled on my living room couch one night with my wife, who is 60, streamingNomadlandon Netflix. McDormand dominates the screen with a stark depiction of aging on the edge. She plays Fern, a recession-scarred modern-day nomad roaming the American West while living in her DIY customized van.It’s a leading role but hardly a glam one. McDormand sports perhaps the best bad hair ever. Virtually everything she owns is secondhand.

",26-07-2021,Why Older Women Are Opting for Longer Hair,"When I was 6 years old, my mother took me to the beauty parlor and instructed the hairdresser to give me a pixie cut. I never forgave her. My hair was so short there was little to tuck into a bathing cap, though we were still forced to wear those awful rubber head coverings anyway. And the quarter-inch-long bangs led some critics to liken the look to a haircut someone who had not yet mastered the use of scissors had given herself.The pixie was inspired by the gamine movie star Audrey Hepburn, and again a few years later by the willowy, waifish Mia Farrow. To a pudgy little girl whose cousin had nicknamed her Butterball, the pixie just reinforced I was anything but.Thus began my lifelong love affair with long, luscious locks. Since grade school, my hair has never been higher than my shoulders.  I was not alone, of course. But through the years, busy lives and social pressures led lots of women to trim their tresses whether short hair looked good on them or not.But a funny thing happened on the way out of the pandemic. As we emerged from our yearlong COVID-19 cocoons, it seemed that women everywhere had had a metamorphosis. Their hair had grown longer than it was in years because of a hiatus on visiting hair salons.What’s more, so many of them liked what they saw, they decided to keep it that way.Susan Feldman has noticed the trend as well from her perch as founder of GetInTheGroove.com, a digital fashion, beauty and health magazine for women 50 and older. “The pandemic gave us opportunities to do and try things we had not been willing to do in normal times,” Feldman says. “It was a perfect time in that way. You were by yourself; you could see how it feels. A lot of older women thought they had to cut their hair as they aged. They now realized, ‘No, I like it long.’”In my 1973 high school yearbook, practically every girl in my graduating class wore her hair nearly down to her waist. Some of us thought it looked sexy; for others it offered a peace-love-rock-’n’-roll vibe. From Rapunzel and Cleopatra to Christie Brinkley and Farrah Fawcett, long hair lovers had lots of inspiration. At least for a while.As my female brethren began to move into the work world en masse for the first time in history and take on serious jobs, many turned to serious hairdos to match — shorter and more practical — especially after they began juggling jobs and children.By middle age, even the long hair holdouts began mirroring their moms and shearing off their hair because that is what mature women did, lest they be accused of trying to look like their daughters.But the pandemic and a burgeoning new take on what aging means to a generation of women who have been pioneers in everything they have done has given them license to experiment.Take Nina Cortell, for example. A prominent Texas lawyer and mother of three grown daughters, Nina assiduously avoided visiting the hair salon for 11 months. Having a physician husband and daughter encouraged her to be extra vigilant. By the time Cortell got her second vaccination, her hair cascaded over her shoulders. It hadn’t been that long since her third year in law school — the year all female law students chopped their tresses no longer than ear length as they began interviewing for jobs. “It’s very freeing and a lot of fun,” she says of her new look. “It makes me regret I didn’t do it sooner.”For Jean Hobby, the former chief operating officer of accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, her newfound, post-pandemic long hair was a welcome surprise. Turns out, long hair was easier for her to manage than the short cut she had worn the past 20 years. It was flattering, as well. With all the new products on the market, even the thickest and waviest manes like Jean’s are no longer a chore, she says. She also discovered the ease of the ponytail after workouts. Previously, she washed her hair every day after exercising.Without the pandemic, Hobby might never have gotten over the societal message that middle-aged women should wear their hair short like their mothers did, whether it suited them or not. That is the reason Jean had cut hers short when she turned 40. “I didn’t want to look like a silly middle-aged woman trying too hard to look young,” says Hobby, who is 60.To some cultural observers, this new longer hair wave among mature women signifies something larger than just a beauty trend. Feldman, of GetInTheGroove.com, sees it as a metaphor for this generation’s effort to redefine a lot of outdated rules for aging in general and for aging women in particular.“Women have heard a lot of ‘you should do this’ and ‘you should do that,’ but they are learning to do what makes them feel good and whattheythink looks good,” says Feldman. “That’s been a silver lining of the pandemic.”Black women have been undergoing a hair transformation that definitely picked up speed during the pandemic, says Teri Agins, 68, a former senior fashion writer forThe Wall Street Journal.“For many it began as a racial pride sort of thing, but during the pandemic everyone had to avoid the salon,” she said.Agins embraced natural hair during the past year and never looked back. She used to go to the salon for chemical straightening every 10 to 12 weeks. Since she stopped, her hair has never been healthier and she now often wears it in two braids.“COVID-19 has been such a traumatic experience,” she adds. “We are coming out of it with different values. I hope they’re lasting.”","When I was 6 years old, my mother took me to the beauty parlor and instructed the hairdresser to give me a pixie cut. I never forgave her.

",18-10-2021,Older Women Actors Who Eternally Inspire Us,"There’s nothing like watching a movie or television show and seeing the face of a contemporary staring back. It is heartening and hopeful that women age 60-plus are represented by female actors who are still powerhouses on- and offscreen. Here are some of their accomplishments and reflections, ascertained from the actors’ profiles on the Internet Movie Database (IMDb), except for Debbie Allen’s and Jane Fonda’s, which are from Quote Fancy and AZ Quotes, respectively.Debbie Allen, 71: “I’m always moving forward,” Allen says of a career that started electrifying audiences when she starred in the 1980 filmFame—a production she also choreographed. The Emmy, Tony and Golden Globe Award winner is currently producing and starring inGrey’s Anatomy,all while empowering Black and Latino dancers via her nonprofit, the Debbie Allen Dance Academy in Los Angeles. She received one of the highest honors in the entertainment field in 2020, as a Kennedy Center honoree cited for her career as a multidisciplinary artist, choreographer and actress. Allen moves seamlessly through artistic disciplines and is a cultural ambassador for all. The woman who danced into our hearts inFameis indeed always moving forward.Frances McDormand, 64: “I’ve got a rubber face. It has always served me very well and really helps, especially as I get older, because I still have all my road map intact, and I can use it at will.” As an opponent of plastic surgery, the wife and mother is saddened when others muck with their road maps: “Joel [Coen, her director husband] has to stop me physically from saying something to people.” For the Oscar winner forFargo(1997) andThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri(2018), three times was the charm in 2021, when she took home another Academy Award forNomadland.Angela Bassett, 63:“I am content that the work that I’ve done is wonderful.” Confidence like this is merited, given that the Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee has built a career out of playing pioneering Black women such as Tina Turner, Betty Shabazz and Jackson 5 matriarch, Katherine. The mother and wife of Courtney B. Vance can be seen on the small screen on9-1-1and will be reprising her role as Ramonda in theBlack PanthersequelWakanda Forever.Catherine O’Hara, 67:“Actors like me want to do a bunch of different characters. Don’t fence me in! Don’t lock me down!” That’s been the MO of this Emmy winner ever since she was introduced to us as the chameleon ofSCTV,impersonating everyone from Tammy Faye Bakker to Katharine Hepburn. It’s no wonder the married mother of two was drawn to the wig-wearing Moira Rose onSchitt’s Creek,the acclaimed sitcom about inclusion, family and bouncing back from hardship.Christine Baranski, 69:“I still feel like I have so much left to do. I don’t feel there’s a period at the end of this sentence yet.” The Emmy- and Tony Award–winning character actress has had a 40-year career so far, during which she’s played the friend, mom, boss and best friend. At age 65, though, the widow and mother of two garnered her own show, transitioning her supporting role as Diane Lockhart onThe Good Wifeinto the starring role onThe Good Fight.Dame Helen Mirren, 76:“The trick in life is learning how to deal with it.” The tattooed Oscar winner began her international career right after graduating from high school, and she has since spanned stage, film and television, in myriad challenging and diverse roles. At age 69, Mirren became a L’Oréal Paris ambassador for the Age Perfect line. Married to director Taylor Hackford, the English actor decided against the “encumbrance” of motherhood because she wished to maintain her freedom.Alfre Woodard, 69:“I’m a mom and a wife. That’s what I do in the world. That’s my identity. Second, I’m an actor.” And what an actor she is. Beginning in 1978, the Emmy winner and Oscar nominee, who is starring in HBO’sSee,left Broadway for Hollywood. She has acting and producing projects lined up beyond 2022. At age 58, she was named byPeoplemagazine as one of the world’s most beautiful people.Michelle Pfeiffer, 63:“I can’t see myself ever retiring. Ever. I feel like I always need to be productive in some way.” The grocery cashier with no formal training took on Hollywood to become an Oscar-nominated actress and Golden Globe winner (as well as called out by Bruno Mars in his hit song “Uptown Funk”). Along with acting and producing for her company, Via Rosa Productions, the mother of two and wife of David E. Kelley makes time for charity work, including the American Cancer Society. At 61, she launched a collection of fragrances named for her children, Henry Rose.Diane Keaton, 75: “When I was younger, I had these enormous vanities about what I expected from myself. Now I see [life] for what it is, so I can be braver and more spontaneous and say to myself,Oh, screw it; just go out there and do it.And the Oscar winner has done quite a bit. Eccentric and free-spirited, she revived the style of women dressing in traditionally male clothing, as seen inAnnie Hall,giving what is considered one of the 100 greatest performances of all time byPremiereMagazine.She is an actor, producer and a pioneer director (a job still few women do). The mother of two has never married: “I never wanted to give up my independence.”All these extraordinary women have one thing in common: They haven’t slowed down. They are seizing opportunities, as they would have when they were younger, but taking with them everything they’ve learned along the way—most importantly, their sense of self.

77,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/why-i-am-getting-remarried-at-71
",22-03-2021,Why I Am Getting Remarried at 71,"By the time you read this, I will be a married woman again. I just giggled when I wrote that sentence and I’m still smiling. I smile quite a lot these days because I’m pretty darn happy, but it wasn’t always like this.I am a wife-turned-caregiver-turned-widow and Charlie, my soon-to-be new husband, had an almost identical journey. We met on an online dating site mere months after our respective longtime spouses died and pretty much knew from the get-go that we were each other’s “it.”It was defining what that “it” was that gave us pause. What do you call two people our ages — 71 and 72 — who fall madly in love? Were we soulmates? Partners? Lovers? Best friends? Companions? Confidants? Crazy?We were all of those things and then some. We both felt we were meant to be together, for now and forever.We began using the L-word pretty early in our courtship and met each other’s grown children and old friends quickly and uneventfully. I even showed up on his arm at his small-town 50th high school reunion, and a few months later, he traveled 3,000 miles to join me at mine.The only raised eyebrows we encountered came from a few well-intended people who thought we were rushing things. They told us that our spouses had been dead for only a few months and that the rules are that we needed to grieve for at least a year.Yeah, well, that didn’t happen. We are living proof that hearts can expand to love new people without pushing out any feelings for those we loved before. I hadn’t cleared out my late-husband’s clothes from the closet before Charlie began coming around.Charlie and I fell deeply in love, and we did so effortlessly. I don’t quite understand it myself, except to say that we both knew what we wanted and we found it in each other. We like to do the same things — hike and eat great food and drink wine —and we share similar political perspectives. Through our caregiving experiences we had a heightened appreciation for the reality that life is short and a healthy life even shorter.Before we knew it, our pillow talk shifted to marriage.Initially, I held up a stop sign. I’m a child of the ’60s; who needs marriage, right? Plus, honestly, to promise anyone that I could again be a caregiver was a promise I wasn’t sure I could make, let alone keep.Could we have a wedding vow that left out the “in sickness” part? Charlie, being Charlie, knew I needed more time to heal the caregiving scars.So, we waited. We will be married this Spring, four years after our first date. In truth, I have always loved the institution of marriage. I love its absoluteness, its pledge to keep believing, its insistence that working things out trumps the ability to bolt even when you want to.

I’m guessing we will pop open some champagne and invite folks at home to join us in a toast to our future.And please, no gifts are necessary because we both have everything we need: Each other.Photo enhancement by Elena Scotti","By the time you read this, I will be a married woman again. I just giggled when I wrote that sentence and I’m still smiling. I smile quite a lot these days because I’m pretty darn happy, but it wasn’t always like this.I am a wife-turned-caregiver-turned-widow and Charlie, my soon-to-be new husband, had an almost identical journey. We met on an online dating site mere months after our respective longtime spouses died and pretty much knew from the get-go that we were each other’s “it.”It was defining what that “it” was that gave us pause. What do you call two people our ages — 71 and 72 — who fall madly in love? Were we soulmates? Partners? Lovers? Best friends? Companions? Confidants? Crazy?We were all of those things and then some. We both felt we were meant to be together, for now and forever.We began using the L-word pretty early in our courtship and met each other’s grown children and old friends quickly and uneventfully. I even showed up on his arm at his small-town 50th high school reunion, and a few months later, he traveled 3,000 miles to join me at mine.The only raised eyebrows we encountered came from a few well-intended people who thought we were rushing things. They told us that our spouses had been dead for only a few months and that the rules are that we needed to grieve for at least a year.Yeah, well, that didn’t happen. We are living proof that hearts can expand to love new people without pushing out any feelings for those we loved before. I hadn’t cleared out my late-husband’s clothes from the closet before Charlie began coming around.Charlie and I fell deeply in love, and we did so effortlessly. I don’t quite understand it myself, except to say that we both knew what we wanted and we found it in each other. We like to do the same things — hike and eat great food and drink wine —and we share similar political perspectives. Through our caregiving experiences we had a heightened appreciation for the reality that life is short and a healthy life even shorter.Before we knew it, our pillow talk shifted to marriage.Initially, I held up a stop sign. I’m a child of the ’60s; who needs marriage, right? Plus, honestly, to promise anyone that I could again be a caregiver was a promise I wasn’t sure I could make, let alone keep.Could we have a wedding vow that left out the “in sickness” part? Charlie, being Charlie, knew I needed more time to heal the caregiving scars.So, we waited. We will be married this Spring, four years after our first date. In truth, I have always loved the institution of marriage. I love its absoluteness, its pledge to keep believing, its insistence that working things out trumps the ability to bolt even when you want to. But getting married at an older age is complicated, finances and family being the biggest hurdles.We tackled those two right off the bat: What each of us brings to the marriage remains our own.

",9/7/2020,Thinking of Retiring Abroad?,"The last time we were in Phuket (Thailand), about a decade ago, my husband and I discussed buying a home there for retirement. We had been living in Thailand for two years and had fallen in love with the country. We weren't only hooked by the endlessly warm weather, delectable food and fascinating culture. Those were all huge factors, but the real selling point for us wasfirst-class health careavailable at bargain-basement prices.Thailand was the fifth country my husband and I lived in together, having met in South Africa in 1996 when we were both young expatriates in search of adventure. From South Africa we moved to his native Holland and then back to South Africa. After our daughter was born in 2000, we decided to try living in my home country and relocated to Connecticut, but after 9/11 we were desperate to move overseas again.It took four years, but when my husband was offered a position at an international bank in Singapore, we jumped. Two years later we were transferred to Bangkok. With our daughter and son (born in 2003) in tow, our tidy family of four had become intrepid travelers and cultural explorers. Having learned firsthand that many countries offer luxurious lifestyles at a fraction of the cost of living in the U.S., retiring abroad seemed like a no-brainer.Ten years later, the dream endures. Unfortunately, the marriage doesn't. In 2012 my husband left me for another woman. By that time we had been back in the U.S. for a year, living in my small New England hometown. My now-single status hasn't dimmed my enthusiasm for retiring abroad, however. In fact, my divorce — and accompanying socioeconomic slide — have only strengthened my desire to move overseas. My ex-husband and I wanted to live abroad so we could have a luxurious lifestyle; post-divorce I'm looking for a way to afford both health care and food in old age.When I first thought of retiring abroad it was a relatively radical idea; now it's mainstream, according to Jennifer Stevens, executive director ofInternational Living, a website and publication that advises people on living, working and retiring overseas. The government currently sends more than693,000 Social Security payments overseas— a 40 percent increase over the past 10 years — but Stevens says the majority of retirees continue to bank in the U.S., so the number of retirees abroad is far higher. Then there are the growing number of Americans who retire abroad long before they are eligible to collect Social Security.Why are the numbers increasing? For the same reasons I want to retire abroad: lower cost of living and good, affordable health care. I have Thailand in mind because it ticks both those boxes and is familiar, not to mention warm.International Livingdoes a yearly ranking of the25 best places to retirebased on considerations such as safety, climate, cost of living, access to health care, entertainment and amenities, visas and ease of fitting in. This year, the top three are Panama, Costa Rica and Mexico (Thailand comes in at number 9). Stevens says the recommendations are the same for singles as for couples, but there may be some nuance when it comes to specific towns or cities.""If you're considering going overseas alone — and many of our readers do — then you'll find it easiest to get settled and connect with a community if you head to a place where there's already a well-established expat presence, particularly if you don't speak the local language well,” Stevens told me in an email, adding that she always recommends learning enough of the language to be polite and make a few local friends.As an example, she cited San Miguel de Allende, Mexico, a popular destination for single (and coupled) American retirees.""It's an easy place to drop into because there are plenty of networking opportunities — restaurants where expats gather, organized volunteer activities, a great Spanish-language school, classes for yoga, salsa, art, and more. All that's useful whether you're part of a couple or single. But as a single, it gives you an instant safety net and can make your transition abroad alone less potentially isolating or lonely,” Stevens says.Another popular destination is Ecuador (number 4 on the list). Stevens says a nicely furnished two-bedroom apartment in the historic district ofCuencarents for less than $500 per month. A meal at a café costs about $6, you'll pay $15-$20 for an entrée at a high-end international restaurant, and a housekeeper will set you back $15 a day.""The kinds of comforts and luxuries the 1% benefit from at home, the average Joe can access in the best-value spots abroad,” Stevens says.Unfortunately, for some Americans, health care falls into the luxury category, which is why retiring abroad is such an attractive option. During a visit to Thailand in 2016, I had an age spot on my face removed with a laser. My dermatologist in the U.S. quoted about $2,000 for the procedure. I had it done at an upscale hospital in Bangkok for roughly $60 — plus $3 for the nurse. I paid out of pocket, which is what many expats do abroad, according to Stevens.There are many health care options overseas, from hospital-based subscription insurance plans, to global health insurance (which typically don't cover the U.S.), to enrolling in the local health care program. In Ecuador, it can cost as little as $100 per month per person, and in Mexico under $400 per month, for example.""This gives you access to state-run hospitals where you'll rarely pay more than a few dollars for care and where expats report the care is good,” Stevens says.It's worth noting that expatscan't use Medicare as insurance overseas, but most Medicare Advantage plans include worldwide emergency medical coverage. Stevens advises folks who plan to live part time in the U.S., or who may move back eventually, to continue paying their premiums.Like many women in my position, I have a compelling financial reason to retire overseas (actually, I plan to continue working), but even if economics weren't a factor, I would do it for the sheer adventure. I moved to South Africa alone when I was 30 and it was one of the best decisions I ever made. Over 20 years later — older but infinitely wiser — I am looking forward to the next great adventure. Who knows? I might even end up on Phuket.Jaimie Seaton has been a journalist for over 20 years, and is a former Newsweek correspondent in Thailand.

",22-10-2020,What Happens When You’re 55 and Still Getting Sexually Harassed?,"One morning last October, I had oral surgery. Years of chewing on hard candies had left me with teeth that needed a root canal and crowns. Eventually, the crowns cracked. My dentist sent me to the oral surgeon, who said I would need not only implants but also a sinus lift in the process.The morning of the sinus lift, I wore a short-sleeved shirt so the IV for the anesthesia could be easily inserted. Afterwards, I remember nothing except that I was cold. I went home and felt weirdly great. I had one cup of coffee and then another. I sat in front of my laptop for hours and worked. I barely checked my email or texts; I did not check social media at all.We’ve reached the end of the nice part of our story.The next morning, the surgeon called and asked how I was feeling. “You’re a genius,” I said, “because I feel no pain. I’m just on my way to the gym.”“Whoa, that’s not a good idea,” he said. “You have to give that hot little body of yours a rest.”The surgeon had always been flirtatious. Occasionally, when I asked him a question about a procedure, he'd respond, “Well, if you were my wife...” and place his hand too long on my arm. I had warned friends whose daughters saw him that they shouldn't wear anything snug or revealing for their visits. Like the book I had read when we first got our puppy that advised us to ignore bad behavior, I had decided to ignore his bad behavior. But his most recent comment bothered me.I was going back to see him for a checkup and then an X-ray and implants. I could switch doctors, but we were halfway through the process and I felt, uncomfortably, at his mercy. Plus, he was good at his job. My teeth had presented many problems to him over the years and he had never been confounded by them. But he did say inappropriate things. I remembered that the morning of my surgery, as the nurse inserted the IV, he had said, “You look great! Do you do Pilates? I bet you do kickboxing...”I know that men of a certain age will pay you a compliment and think they’re being kind. Courtly even. I worked at a business magazine for 10 years and an investment bank before that. An old boss had once called out, “Great dress!” as he looked at me appreciatively. I had become used to men commenting on my appearance even when they shouldn’t. Though do you ever get used to it?Because there was almost always a nurse in the room while the oral surgeon worked on my teeth, I mostly felt fine with him. I told my husband. He asked, “How would you feel if your trainer said that to you?”""I don’t have a trainer,” I said, “but in the work place, people should not comment on each other’s appearances.”Two days after surgery, my cheek was swollen and my mouth was twisted. There was a green-and-blue mark blooming on my cheek. I looked beaten up. The surgeon’s remarks nagged at me. I had been unconscious while he worked on my mouth. I wondered what else he was saying and who he was saying it to.I was raised to want to be attractive, by a beautiful mother and an exquisitely dressed grandmother. When I was working as a business reporter in my 20s and 30s, I often appeared on TV. I knew that attractiveness translated into a certain power. But as I edged into my 50s, barely anyone noticed what I looked like anymore. In middle age, you stop thinking your appearance is going to provoke people. Though that is probably wishful thinking. People in positions of power can behave badly no matter how old you are.I told my dentist what happened. He offered to call the surgeon's practice and switch me to the younger doctor.The morning of the second surgery, a hot summer day, I dressed as if it were fall, in a long sweater and pants. On our way there, my husband said, “Do you want me to say anything if we see the guy?”“What are you going to say? Don’t look at my wife?”The whole thing made me angry. Why did I have to think about this when getting oral surgery? Why should anyone have to think about this? I was brought into the operating room. The younger surgeon walked in, his mouth covered by a mask. His eyes were kind. The nurse swabbed my arm to ready it for the IV. The surgeon warned there might be a prick. While he inserted the IV, he asked me how many miles I ran.A week later, I returned for a check-up. A friend texted: “Yikes, the oral surgeon, hopefully you don't have to wear a tent!” I thought about the other doctors I see — internist, gynecologist, dermatologist, radiologist, therapist — all women. None had ever said anything inappropriate. The younger surgeon said the implants were healing nicely. He was lovely and competent, but as I walked out of his office into the hot sun, I doubted I would ever see him or his partner again.","One morning last October, I had oral surgery.

80,"https://www.aarpethel.com/fulfillment/the-six-big-life-lessons-i-learned-from-millennials
",4/10/2021,The Six Big Life Lessons I Learned From Millennials,"My kids, 30 and 33, live across the country from their dad and me. When we could not be together in person, they invited us and their friends to an online game. We played Quiplash, where you vote on each other’s answers to silly questions. I didn’t do terribly well at the game but learned a lot from these youngsters. They talked about the challenges of their careers, their favorite pastimes and hopes for the future.A New OutlookMy children grew up in a safe suburban neighborhood because that is where my parents told me to raise kids. I was further instructed to start having them before age 30. I bought a house, got a reliable car and followed the script given by my predecessors.By contrast, my son and daughter live in Seattle apartments and show no signs of procreating. Neither owns a car — they walk or take public transportation everywhere. This generation is writing its own script.Who are the millennials? Born between 1980 and 1994, millennials came of age during the turn of the last century. Also known as Generation Y, they have seen sweeping changes in technology, gender liberation and public policy. They adjust easily to cultural shifts and may have something to teach their elders.What Can We Learn? Here are six major attributes of Gen Y, and what we Boomers might learn from them: Millennials adapt to change. Because they have seen so much transformation in their short lifetimes, millennials tend to embrace it. Whether it is the latest technology or a new job, this age group jumps in with both feet. While I might dread learning a new phone, my kids act like it’s the best toy in the world. If a job does not lead to growth, they find one that does. Since the only certainty in life is change, it makes sense to examine our lives and keep moving forward so we don’t get left behind. Millennials value experiences over material goods. I saved memorabilia for my kids to go through on their last visit and couldn’t believe what they discarded! Don’t worry, I rescued some of it, but they tend to live in smaller spaces and do not want great-grandma’s china. At half my age, however, they have taken more trips outside the country than I ever will. Let’s create memories, not storage problems. Gen Y pursues passion. Millennials talk about “side hustles” which means using skills to create an extra money stream. Many of them, like my juggling, unicycle-riding son, spend time and energy on hobbies. Is there a skill you can share or something you’ve always wanted to learn? It’s a real morale boost to acquire new know-how and it keeps those brain neurons firing. 30-Somethings believe in self-care. Millennials spend time and money on fitness and other healthy pursuits but it doesn’t stop there. Mental health is important to them and, fortunately, seeking help for personal issues has lost its stigma. Everyone struggles now and then. Look at your insurance card; chances are a counselor is a phone call away. You’d want your kids to seek aid if they needed it. They want that for you, too. Open-mindedness is a hallmark of this group. Our children’s generation, when talking about nontraditional marriage, are fond of the expression “Love is love.” Gone are the days of thinking everyone should be attracted to a member of the opposite sex or someone of the same race. Remember, changing your stance is a sign of growth, not weakness. Let’s keep growing. Social responsibility is something our children take seriously.

When we could not be together in person, they invited us and their friends to an online game. We played Quiplash, where you vote on each other’s answers to silly questions. I didn’t do terribly well at the game but learned a lot from these youngsters. They talked about the challenges of their careers, their favorite pastimes and hopes for the future.A New OutlookMy children grew up in a safe suburban neighborhood because that is where my parents told me to raise kids. I was further instructed to start having them before age 30. I bought a house, got a reliable car and followed the script given by my predecessors.By contrast, my son and daughter live in Seattle apartments and show no signs of procreating. Neither owns a car — they walk or take public transportation everywhere. This generation is writing its own script.Who are the millennials? Born between 1980 and 1994, millennials came of age during the turn of the last century. Also known as Generation Y, they have seen sweeping changes in technology, gender liberation and public policy. They adjust easily to cultural shifts and may have something to teach their elders.What Can We Learn? Here are six major attributes of Gen Y, and what we Boomers might learn from them: Millennials adapt to change. Because they have seen so much transformation in their short lifetimes, millennials tend to embrace it. Whether it is the latest technology or a new job, this age group jumps in with both feet. While I might dread learning a new phone, my kids act like it’s the best toy in the world. If a job does not lead to growth, they find one that does. Since the only certainty in life is change, it makes sense to examine our lives and keep moving forward so we don’t get left behind. Millennials value experiences over material goods. I saved memorabilia for my kids to go through on their last visit and couldn’t believe what they discarded! Don’t worry, I rescued some of it, but they tend to live in smaller spaces and do not want great-grandma’s china. At half my age, however, they have taken more trips outside the country than I ever will. Let’s create memories, not storage problems. Gen Y pursues passion. Millennials talk about “side hustles” which means using skills to create an extra money stream. Many of them, like my juggling, unicycle-riding son, spend time and energy on hobbies. Is there a skill you can share or something you’ve always wanted to learn? It’s a real morale boost to acquire new know-how and it keeps those brain neurons firing. 30-Somethings believe in self-care. Millennials spend time and money on fitness and other healthy pursuits but it doesn’t stop there. Mental health is important to them and, fortunately, seeking help for personal issues has lost its stigma. Everyone struggles now and then. Look at your insurance card; chances are a counselor is a phone call away. You’d want your kids to seek aid if they needed it. They want that for you, too. Open-mindedness is a hallmark of this group. Our children’s generation, when talking about nontraditional marriage, are fond of the expression “Love is love.” Gone are the days of thinking everyone should be attracted to a member of the opposite sex or someone of the same race.

",8/7/2020,Cleavage Reboot: How to Smooth Out Chest Wrinkles,"Last summer, around the Fourth of July, Francesca Castagnoli saw fireworks — but not the kind she was hoping for. “I looked down and saw this spray of wrinkles starting in my cleavage and erupting up my chest,” describes the 48-year-old journalist from Montclair, N.J.Growing up, Castagnoli loved being tan. In her 40s, she became diligent about protecting her face, wearing sunscreen and a hat on the regular. But she neglected her chest, as most of us do. The fallout? Cleavage wrinkles, aka “clinkles” (or its crasser moniker, cougar cleavage). While they may evoke images of Magda inThere’s Something About Mary,the truth is that many women entering their 40s are starting to see the results of ignoring the clavicle-to-nipple region.Most wrinkles are the result of sun damage, but even the most vigilant among us often forget to slather our décolletage with SPF anything before heading out the door. Because chest skin is thinner than the skin on the rest of the body, it’s even more prone to sun damage. Complicating matters, it’s about 10 to 15 times more sensitive than other skin, too, notes dermatologist Samantha Conrad, clinical practice director at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, so it doesn’t tolerate aggressive treatments very well.Large-busted? You might notice vertical lines faster, especially if you're a chronic side-sleeper, Conrad says, as gravity causes a compression-like effect between the breasts.Still, there are some steps you can take to iron out cleavage wrinkles.Level the playing field“A wrinkle is a depression in the skin, and we want to bring down the sides of the wrinkles so everything is the same depth,” explains J. Timothy Katzen, a board-certified plastic surgeon and owner of Body by Katzen in Beverly Hills, Las Vegas and Dubai. He says beginner patients can start with a glycolic acid chemical peel. Skin will turn red after application and may feel like it has a deep sunburn, but you can return to work immediately. The acid helps slough out the outermost layers of skin, improving texture but only yielding about a 20 percent reduction in wrinkles, Katzen estimates. (Cost: $250 to $1,000)Lasers can even things out even more. Katzen likes the Nd:YAG laser for crepey décolletage. (You’ll likely need three treatments, spaced six weeks apart from each other, costing $1,000 to 1,500 per treatment.) Once again, expect a sunburned look; downtime is usually a day. The payoff: an 80 percent reduction in wrinkles.You could also try the PicoSure laser, says Johanna S. Youner, a certified laser specialist and owner of Park Avenue Laser Treatment in New York City. Often used for tattoo removal, this laser has a faster speed and feels like the snap of a rubber band. It doesn’t get very hot, meaning minimal redness. This one, too, requires multiple treatments; expect three, spaced six weeks apart, for a 65 to 70 percent reduction, with no downtime. ($750 per visit on average)Fill ‘er upAnother way to attack deeper, discrete lines is to fill up the valleys so that they’re flush with the rest of the skin. That’s what Castagnoli opted for a few years ago when she tackled her chest wrinkles. Her doctor warned her that because chest skin is relatively thin, traditional hyaluronic acid fillers like Restylane and Juvéderm can result in a bumpy-looking texture, and their bluish tint can even show through fair skin. Instead, he suggested Belotero, at the time a newer, colorless, ultra-thin filler that can be massaged and molded, once injected, for a smooth result. After applying a topical anesthetic, her doctor added lidocaine to the syringe full of filler to help prevent burning during injection. “When I walked out, you could barely see the wrinkles,” she says.Belotero costs about $650 per syringe and should last six months to a year. Newly recommitted to dulling her fireworks display, Castagnoli says she’s planning on creating a “décolletage budget” for 2019, on top of her facial filler budget, as well as investing in a rash guard to wear when she hits the beach with her family.Get pricklyConrad recommends microneedling to stimulate collagen production and improve texture. Your dermatologist will use a tool that creates teeny, sterile pinpricks in your skin. As the punctures heal, they encourage the skin to remodel, improving the appearance of wrinkles — but not getting rid of them. (You’ll likely need three treatments, spaced one month apart from each other, costing $1,000 total.)Buy a boobie pillowYou heard right. Pillows exist just for your breasts, separating and supporting them so that when you sleep on your side, they don’t smush together. This results in deep morning wrinkles that, over time, can become permanent etchings. Conrad said they may be worth a shot for large-breasted women. Two models on the market include theIntimia Pillow Bra($34.95) and theBosom Buddy($34.95).Minimize damage moving forwardEvery expert interviewed for this story emphasized using sunblock daily to minimize further wrinkling.Conrad also suggests a multipronged skin care regimen that includes an antioxidant product in the morning and a retrinol-containing one at night. “Antioxidant products provide protection from the free radical damage that occurs as a result of sun exposure, radiation and pollution, helping sunscreens work better,” she says. She likesSkinCeuticalsC E Ferulic ($166) orSkinBetter’sAlto Defense Serum ($145).“Then at night, I like retrinols — they’re like the gentler cousin to tretinoin (Retin A) and don’t need a prescription.

",24-05-2021,Secrets to Better Sleep After Menopause,"According to the results of my sleep chronotype quiz, I am a dolphin, which is surprising. My kids would classify me more as a bear — at least until I’ve had my first cup of coffee in the morning.“Everyone has a different biological clock … that sets your day’s hormones, energy levels and has an incredible influence on your daily success,” explains Michael Breus, a clinical psychologist and a fellow of the American Academy of Sleep, in his video on the dolphin chronotype.  “At what time your clock runs is called your chronotype,” he adds, which can be classified into four categories — dolphin, lion, bear and wolf. Knowing which you are can help you understand how to work with your body to get a good night’s sleep, rather than fight against it.But even if I do everything that might help me as a dolphin, a light sleeper, statistics around sleep problems aren’t encouraging. According to The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation (SWAN), sleep disturbances range from 16 to 42 percent in premenopausal women and then climb to 35 to 60 percent when we’re postmenopausal. These sleep difficulties postmenopause run the gamut — from problems falling asleep, to staying asleep, to waking early and not feeling rested. Insomnia can wreak havoc on our lives, causing problems with everything from memory to increased risk for cardiovascular disease, to greater anxiety and irritability, to lower quality of life.However, the good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way, In fact, “There is recent data to show if you are not sleeping well as you get older, it is more of a sign of your health status than your sleep status,” according to Breus, speaking in his master class, “Why Am I So Exhausted? How Your Sleep Has Changed and What You Can Do About it.” In other words, as we age “we should not be sleeping poorly,” he continues.However, there are more challenges as we age, particularly for women. The reason for women’s postmenopausal sleep problems include, in large part, the fact that estrogen and progesterone hit rock bottom after menopause, and the ratio of these two hormones to testosterone is also thrown off balance, says Abhinav Singh, M.D. medical director of the Indiana Sleep Center. This imbalance may be one of the reasons thatsleep apnea(a sleep disorder in which breathing stops and starts), tends to become more common in postmenopause, and closer to its prevalence in men.This is also a time when snoring and weight both tend to increase.Hot flashes(or sudden intense heat in the upper body) andnight sweats(the ones that occur at night) are also linked to insomnia as we age.  It’s not clear whether it’s the hot flashes that trigger the night waking, or the other way around, says Singh, although likely hot flashes cause the sleep disruption early in the night, during deep sleep, while later in the night, during REM sleep, it’s more likely that the sleep disruption happens first and then the hot flash.I can certainly attest to the ravages these hot flashes have on my sleep. I often wake in the night drenched, and end up hyperalert at 3 a.m., reading a novel with my phone light under the covers in what my husband refers to as our “humid bed.” This can be very anxiety-provoking.“Mood disorders and sleep disorders are good friends,” explains Singh. But which comes first is hard to say. He believes that any discussion of medication therapy with your doctor should incorporate a discussion of both sleep and mood issues, rather than treating each one separately. For example, symptoms of restless or twitching legs can be exacerbated by medications such as SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, the antidepressants often prescribed to treat depression and anxiety.Fortunately, we can improve both the quality of our sleep and the length of time we get shut-eye.Here are some recommendations from the sleep experts.Get into good daytime habits.Exercise is good for many things, and that includes sleep. Do about 20 minutes of cardio per day, but avoid vigorous exercise late in the day. Eat around the same time each day. And cut down on coffee and alcohol! If you drink coffee, stop by 2 p.m.Prepare yourself for bed. This is what Singh refers to as sleep 4-play. He divides the hour before bed into four parts, each 10 to 15 minutes: Have a warm shower to dilate the skin, which will facilitate heat loss and in turn cool down your core.Journal or write down anything that you need to stop circulating in your brain, whether it’s worries or a to-do list for the next day.Read something relaxing.Meditate or do yoga to anchor the mind and calm your breathing. There are many free meditation apps, such as Insight Timer, that you can use. You also need to dim the lights well before bed. Bright lights suppress the production of melatonin, a hormone that helps us sleep. In his master class, Breus recommends wearing blue-light-blocking glasses when we’re using smartphones and online devices in the evening to help protect us from the harmful effects of blue wavelength light.If you wake in the night,with a hot flash, and are feeling stressed, use a cognitive-behavioral approach to calm yourself down, says Kate Panter, M.D., a gynecologist and obstetrician in the United Kingdom. So instead of freaking out about being tired the next day, you can use more positive self-talk. For example, you could ask yourself, “What would my best friend or someone I love say? “You’ll get back to sleep. Millions of people around the world struggle with this.”Start your morning right. “If I could give everyone one tip, it would be wake up at the same time every single day,” Breus says. He then recommends that you take five deep breaths to wake up the respiratory system, and have 20 to 30 ounces of room temperature water next to you when you sit up, because sleep is very dehydrating. Then “get light into your eyeballs.” Ideally, getting outside into sunlight is optimal, but if it’s still dark outside, artificial light (such as a light box) will help to get rid of the brain fog. Also, get blood tests to check that you are not deficient iniron, magnesium, Vitamin Dormelatonin.Finally, Singh suggests minimizing the use of sleep aids (over the counter or prescription) in favor of behavioral and cognitive approaches to improving sleep. “Making changes to how you prepare and think about sleep will be the best approach over the long term,” he says.","According to the results of my sleep chronotype quiz, I am a dolphin, which is surprising.

83,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/as-we-grow-older-my-husband-seems-older-than-me
",7/6/2021,"As We Grow Older, My Husband Seems Older Than Me","I used to be married to a handyman. If I ran over the sprinkler head, my husband would get down on his hands and knees to fix it. If the garbage disposal puked up last night’s dinner, he crawled under the sink and unclogged the elbow. When the earthquake moved our patio a few inches to the north, he mixed up the concrete and repaired the damage.Granted, I’m still married to that same man, but the years and a rare form of brain cancer have taken a toll on his physical abilities. And contrary to popular belief, 60 isnotthe new 40.Once a six-foot-tall, straight-backed man with a head of gorgeous hair, due to the weakness in his right side caused by his tumor, he currently spends most of his days in a wheelchair. I spend hours pushing him, studying the lines on his bald head. When he does walk, he is hunched over and it’s all I can do not to yell at him. “Posture. Look up!”I’m looking at how this man has transformed. One minute I’m hunched under the weight of my sadness. The next, I’m ready to shout at whoever will listen. Aging is inevitable, but this isn’t fair. I feel cheated out of the future we never had time to plan. I, too, have aged.But never having been as active as my husband, I haven’t lost as much in the way of “how it used to be.” When he sits in his wheelchair watching baseball, his facial expressions tell me he yearns for those days of hitting grand slams and running the bases. He gave his golf clubs to our grandson. And his guitars sit in the closet, the strings collecting dust.I go for shorter walks, perform less sit-ups and take an occasional nap. Unlike my husband, I have a core group of girlfriends with whom I share my feelings. I’m content and accept the changes to my body. And now as I start my seventh decade, I have the confidence I lacked as a young woman. Consequently, I have gladly accepted the household tasks which have fallen on me. Although, most of the time I don’t know what I’m doing. My husband’s inabilities have brought to lightmyinadequacies in taking care of our home.In my youth, as I was taught, I relied on my father. In my early 20s, nothing seemed to ever need repairs, except for my love life. Once married, I relied on my husband. And now, although I’m doing the physical work, I’m still relying on his guidance. But I am learning that Icando these things myself.I’ve put on kneepads, once used for more pleasurable activities, and crawled under the kitchen sink to inspect a leaky faucet. I’ve climbed up ladders. Six feet high now feels like 60! When we had hard wood floor installed, I loaded books from the shelves and carried them to the garage. One cautious armful at a time.I felt empowered by what I had accomplished. I knew my actions were showing my daughter and granddaughter that women are just as capable as men. The old philosophy of relying on a strong man is as outdated as the rotary telephone.Still, old habits are hard to kill. With each task, I looked to my husband for advice.“You’re not turning the screwdriver in the right direction.” My husband would bark at me as I attempted these tasks. “Don’t use so much duct tape. What’s going on down there?”I often want to shout back, but what good would that do? I know he’s not angry with me. He’s frustrated with the situation. He wants to do it himself.And believe me, I wish he could do these things himself. It’s been painful to watch his decline. I try let him accomplish as much as possible.I remember the day my 85-year-old father used his band saw to mend the leg on a coffee table. He was as familiar with that dangerous tool as he was with the back of his hand. But that day his fingers shook and his mind wasn’t 100 percent on the task in front of him. I couldn’t believe my mom let him do it. But she knew. She knew his pride was involved. I was a nervous wreck. Better to wound his self-esteem than lose a finger.My mother is a wise woman. So, when my husband decided to change the ceiling fan, I thought about my mother’s words. And instead of insisting we ask our 40-something son-in-law to replace the fan, I agreed to help my husband.In order to accomplish this, he had to stand on our bed. No easy task, as he kept wobbling around. Eventually, I stood behind him, pressing my palms against his butt — no easy task either, as he is double my weight.Once he removed the old fan and assured me he had it under control, I turned my back for a second. That’s when I heard the crash. The new motor had slipped from his grasp and fallen onto the floor.My husband’s face said it all. He was pissed at the years for stripping away his strength. “I just couldn’t hold my arms up any longer.”“It’s OK,” I said. “You’ve been holding up your arms for a very long time.”Nothing could be more true. He had held up our daughter every year in order for her to see the fireworks. He caught his son summer after summer as he learned to swim. He held up my father when he became too weak to walk. He has held our family together with hard work and perseverance. And he is always there to catch me when my days spin too fast.I assured him that physical work did not make the man. As we age, just because we can’t hammer and pound does not mean we are useless. He still possesses the knowledge to repair anything andeverything,and with the years has come the wisdom to do it right, the first time.","I used to be married to a handyman. If I ran over the sprinkler head, my husband would get down on his hands and knees to fix it. If the garbage disposal puked up last night’s dinner, he crawled under the sink and unclogged the elbow. When the earthquake moved our patio a few inches to the north, he mixed up the concrete and repaired the damage.Granted, I’m still married to that same man, but the years and a rare form of brain cancer have taken a toll on his physical abilities. And contrary to popular belief, 60 isnotthe new 40.Once a six-foot-tall, straight-backed man with a head of gorgeous hair, due to the weakness in his right side caused by his tumor, he currently spends most of his days in a wheelchair. I spend hours pushing him, studying the lines on his bald head. When he does walk, he is hunched over and it’s all I can do not to yell at him. “Posture. Look up!”I’m looking at how this man has transformed. One minute I’m hunched under the weight of my sadness. The next, I’m ready to shout at whoever will listen. Aging is inevitable, but this isn’t fair. I feel cheated out of the future we never had time to plan. I, too, have aged.But never having been as active as my husband, I haven’t lost as much in the way of “how it used to be.” When he sits in his wheelchair watching baseball, his facial expressions tell me he yearns for those days of hitting grand slams and running the bases. He gave his golf clubs to our grandson. And his guitars sit in the closet, the strings collecting dust.I go for shorter walks, perform less sit-ups and take an occasional nap. Unlike my husband, I have a core group of girlfriends with whom I share my feelings. I’m content and accept the changes to my body. And now as I start my seventh decade, I have the confidence I lacked as a young woman. Consequently, I have gladly accepted the household tasks which have fallen on me. Although, most of the time I don’t know what I’m doing. My husband’s inabilities have brought to lightmyinadequacies in taking care of our home.In my youth, as I was taught, I relied on my father. In my early 20s, nothing seemed to ever need repairs, except for my love life. Once married, I relied on my husband. And now, although I’m doing the physical work, I’m still relying on his guidance. But I am learning that Icando these things myself.I’ve put on kneepads, once used for more pleasurable activities, and crawled under the kitchen sink to inspect a leaky faucet. I’ve climbed up ladders. Six feet high now feels like 60! When we had hard wood floor installed, I loaded books from the shelves and carried them to the garage. One cautious armful at a time.I felt empowered by what I had accomplished. I knew my actions were showing my daughter and granddaughter that women are just as capable as men. The old philosophy of relying on a strong man is as outdated as the rotary telephone.Still, old habits are hard to kill. With each task, I looked to my husband for advice.“You’re not turning the screwdriver in the right direction.” My husband would bark at me as I attempted these tasks. “Don’t use so much duct tape. What’s going on down there?”I often want to shout back, but what good would that do? I know he’s not angry with me. He’s frustrated with the situation. He wants to do it himself.And believe me, I wish he could do these things himself. It’s been painful to watch his decline. I try let him accomplish as much as possible.I remember the day my 85-year-old father used his band saw to mend the leg on a coffee table.

",29-11-2021,Why I Started Surfing at 61,"Do we all secretly wonder what will be our demise? Or is it just me? Conceivably, my undoing could have been at 61, from trying to learn to surf, on Maui. Thankfully, I lived to tell about it, and surfing is my latest sports addiction.During a morning walk on Kaanapali Beach in Hawaii with my husband and 18-year-old son, Tanner, I saw a “Learn to Surf” sign and signed up, immediately. Back in our hotel room, trying to cheat fate, I practiced all the moves in advance, while balancing on a cushy bed, and watching surfing-at-any-age videos. My son rolled his eyes. Author and her son pose with a surfboard.Alandra Porrazzo, Island Dream Production At high noon, we headed to the beachfront surf club, where my new classmates included two elementary school-age kids, Tanner and three other teenagers. As we practiced surfing on sand, the kids caught on immediately. Meanwhile, I tested the instructor’s patience. “Lie flat on the board on your stomach,” he practically screamed. “Arch your back!” … “Lift your chest off the board!” … “Lift one knee up at a 45-degree angle!” … “Jump up, staying low, and turn your body!”Each time I jumped up, according to him, my legs — longer than his, I might add — were “too far apart” … I wasn’t “balanced right” … I didn’t bend my knees … I was “too far forward” or “too far back.” And, “Stop looking down, because that’s where you’ll end up!” It felt like a surf club torture chamber.We finally headed to the ocean with our 9-foot-by-2-foot boards attached to our legs with an ankle leash. As the kids surfed in, my faulty ankle strap kept detaching, as the rough waters repeatedly catapulted me and the board, crashing backto the shoreline. Eventually, sheathed in more sand than swim attire, with bruised and bleeding shins, I scrambled to success. For two hours — in one of the best full-body workouts and most exhilarating experiences of my life — I paddled out, incessantly, and caught wave after wave.Spoiler alert:I never actually stood up fully, and surfed — I only continually crashed and burned. I felt foolish, like a girl at a high school cheerleading try out who couldn’t jump up with legs spread wide, put her arms in a big V and land on one knee. Either way, I’m hooked andhardwiredto return to Hawaii ASAP, and try again!So, why must I go back for more?My predilection for trying new sports started in elementary school, when my 6-foot-5-inch all-star-everything jock of a dad taught me to play baseball. One day, showing off for the neighborhood boys how I could switch hit, I slammed a baseball through our front window.“Just you wait until your dad gets home!” my mom screeched in her lovely Indonesian-Dutch accent. When my dad arrived, I got a big hug and kiss. “I’ve always wanted a baseball player in the family,” he said. “But I never knew it would be my little Tebbie Lynn.” That was his endearing nickname for me.Sports always equaled fun and adulation, although back then, kids were cut regularly from sports teams (and perhaps their dreams, too). In 1971, at 12 years old, 5 feet 5 inches and 105 pounds, I was devastated when cut from my junior high school basketball team.I’m thinking now how that coincided with my parents’ traumatic divorce.In 1975, before Title IX kicked in fully, opening up traditional males-only sports for women, I was one of the “10 most outstanding athletes” at my sizable inner-city high school. As a sophomore, I was number one and captain of my varsity tennis team. We weren’t given team uniforms but wore our own short shorts, or short tennis dresses, with matching frilly panties that showed. As a senior, I shared an MVP award on our varsity softball team, on which we wore hand-me-down junior varsity boys’ uniforms — including their used white “sanitary socks” and tattered belts.I recall feeling proud to wear the boys’ uniforms, and not short changed. I was empowered, and humored, wearing the boys’ clothes, while retaining ourCharlie’s Angelsphysiques, haircuts, makeup and frilly underthings — and still, unexpectedly, hitting the crap out of the ball.No one ever told me and my friends — many also raised by single moms — that college sport scholarships were available for girls, too. I was heartened to learn, though, that since the early 1970s when Title IX was enacted, girls’ participation in high school sports has grown from less than 300,000 to almost 3.5 million in the 2018–2019 school year. Girls now make up almost 43 percent of high school athletes, according to data from the National Federation of State High School Associations.And I persisted, long after those athletic teen years. In my early 50s, after completing two sprint triathlons consisting of a 2-mile swim, 13.5-mile hilly bike ride and a 3-mile run, my friends said, “Your kids must be proud.”The reaction from my kids, who were then ages 18, 14 and 8? “It’s not a big deal, Mom, you just do stuff like this.”In my late 50s, my United States Tennis Association tennis team made it to the sectionals championships in Oregon. Now in my 60s, when I asked my son Tanner what he thought of our learning to surf together: “You’ve normalized what moms do,” he said. “I never think about it.” In the end, in surfing and in life, I’ll continue to be motivated by Maria Shriver’s quote: “Stop being ashamed of how many times you’ve fallen, and start being proud of how many times you got up.” I will remain that girl who still wants to show off for the neighborhood boys.","Do we all secretly wonder what will be our demise?

",27-09-2021,Eye-Popping Beauty Secrets Every Mature Woman Should Know,"The eyes are everything, especially these days with frequent mask wearing. In my 20 years’ experience as a makeup artist and aesthetician whose clients mainly range in age from 50 to 90, I’ve found that accentuating the eyes is a central game changer.Here are a few time-trusted secrets that make your eyes pop, which is increasingly important as the years accumulate.The eyes tell a story of who we are—the mystery, the depth. And, yes, the cliché is true: “The eyes are the window to the soul.” First, a must-have is a super emollient eye serum. One of my proven go-tos is Cosmedix Opti Crystal ($95). This is the unicorn of eye creams because it treats all the areas—fine lines, dark circles and crow’s-feet.This product is 97.7 percent pure liquid-crystal technology, which gives the serum an iridescent color, and has so many benefits. Although pricey, a tube of this magic potion should provide at least 90 applications.Another favorite at a lower price point is balm for tired eyes: Olay Regenerist Retinol 24 Night Eye Cream. At around $45 (depending where you shop), this retinol-rich product is great for sensitive skin.I also recommend the Precision Eye Serum Applicator (also Cosmedix; $18), paired with the eye serum of your choice. This crystal-shaped tool allows you to evenly distribute the serum around the delicate under-eye skin. The cooling sensation of the applicator not only helps with puffiness and dryness but also reduces the risk of spreading bacteria.The next must-haves for fuller lashes and brows are Borboleta Lash Serum ($65) and Image Brow and Lash Enhancement Serum ($49). Add these products to your nightly routine by swiping your lashes. My clients see results within a few weeks. These are the only lash serums I have carried that have not caused eye irritation. And unlike some other brands, they won’t change the color of your eyelids or eyes.Both serums are fragrance-free and animal-cruelty-free formulas and offer super safe and nourishing fuller lashes and eyebrows.OK, let’s move up one step for a lasting eye-catching look: semipermanent eyelash extensions, a procedure that is $200 and up. This is definitely a supreme confidence and beauty booster if you are aware of increasing signs of aging in the eye area. I often hear from clients that lash extensions changed their mind about getting surgical eye lifts.Eyelash extensions, which mimic your natural lashes, offer myriad options of curvatures, lengths and thicknesses to achieve your chosen look. Each extension strand is applied to each single lash, resulting in a seamless and natural appearance. Touch-ups are necessary every few weeks and can run about $50 and up, depending on your salon.I cannot stress this enough: Make sure to go to a certified eyelash specialist. I personally am certified through Xtreme Eyelash Extensions by Jo Mousselli and have had excellent results with its adhesives, extensions and detailed instructions for aftercare. My clients check out the results in the mirror after my applications, and I see them batting their eyelashes with huge smiles.I am well aware of the cost and addiction of eyelash extensions, so if you want a more affordable alternative, turn to products that lift and tint lashes. This treatment is so low maintenance that you’ll wonder why you hadn’t done it sooner.Basically, it is a process that gives the appearance of longer, thicker and darker lashes by redirecting growth into a new lifted style. My favorite products for this treatment are by Elleebana and SugarLash. Once the lashes are lifted, in the same appointment your aesthetician can add a tint with a safe vegetable dye. The results typically last six to 12 weeks, depending on your natural lash shedding.Now get out there and treat yourself to some eye-popping treatments and tricks. I promise you, girlfriends will ask, “Did you get your eyes done?!”","The eyes are everything, especially these days with frequent mask wearing.

",8/7/2020,The Day I Stopped Being Attractive to Men,"I used to get free slices of cheese from the guy at the deli counter. This was how I knew I was still attractive to men. Hey! It's not the highest bar, but it was a bar. The deli guy would raise an eyebrow and say, “You wanna slice, gorgeous?” This was winning on both fronts — being called gorgeous, and also the free cheese.The free cheese stopped a few years ago. I'd like to think there was a policy change, but I'm not that naive.Back in the day — my 30s and 40s — men would (occasionally) offer to buy me a drink, hold the door, check out mycleavage. And then … they didn't. It just stopped. I kept up with the game, putting my hairstylist's grandchildren through college, wearing uncomfortable heels in an attempt at being chic, squashing myself into Spanx. It was exhausting. I'm ashamed to tell you how many antiaging skin care products I owned. How much money and time I spent every five weeks with Robert, sitting for eons with smelly gunk on my head so I could pretend I was still a brunette with chestnut highlights.And then … I stopped. I'm 54. My kids are both grown and wonderful, my husband thinks I'm beautiful and I have a great career. Why was I trying so hard? Spending so much money? I had never been the prettiest woman in the room, and I never would be. The whole “make the most of what you have” idea … meh. How about “be comfortable” instead? How about “Stop trying to look a decade younger than you are?""So Iwent gray. I didn't get a haircut for months. It was winter, I wore hats, and I waited until I had inches of roots showing. Then I presented myself to Robert and said, “Cut off all the brown.""He did. Suddenly, I wasn't a brunette anymore. I wasn't even salt-and-pepper. My hair has a shocking amount of silver, so much so that my little 4-year-old neighbor innocently asked, “Did snow fall on your head?” I waited a beat and said, “No. My hair is sparkly now.""My mom and sister are both redheads. Neither has gone gray the way I have. Mom's hair is strawberry blonde now, and my sister barely has any gray in her dark red hair. Me? I'm my father's child. I started going gray when I was 19, and after I had my kids, I don't think a single brown hair grew on my head again. Twenty years is a long time to pretend you're not aging.I like my silvery hair. I really do. I like being in my 50s, being proud of theadults my kids have become. I like being old enough to know things. The map of my life is written on my face in the wrinkles there, and I like it. I like being confident enough, after a mere four decades of playing with makeup, to wear bright red lipstick.And, strangely enough, men seem to notice me again. I think it's the laissez-faire attitude. Let's say the Popeye philosophy of “I am what I am.” The other day, as I was walking through Manhattan, a very young, very handsome shirtless Apollo of a man made a wonderful clicking sound and said, “Hey there, mami.""""Why hello!” said I. “Tell your mother she raised you right.” Oh shush, feminists! Feminism is about choice, and I chose to be utterly delighted at this young man's attention. Was he pity-flirting? I didn't care! He saw me. He saw a woman who was clearly middle-aged, slightly overweight, dressed in sensible shoes with silvery hair and a smile, and he clicked at me and made my frickin’ day.Later that same day, I was battling the barbarian hordes of Times Square on my way back to the hotel, and I caught eyes with a very tall, good-looking man probably in his 40s. He waved his finger up and down at me and said, “Fabulous!""Fabulous? “Thank you, sweetheart!” I said in my momlike way. Was he gay? Probably! And heck, even better, right? I mean, if a gay man thinks you're fabulous, who are you to question that?I've been a writer for a long time now. Nineteen books, the first of which came out when I was 41. I'm older than many women in my industry, and I'm hearing things like, “I want to be you when I grow up” and “I've been reading you since I was in high school.” I don't worry about who does or doesn't like me, and I find myself calling younger writers “sweetheart” and “darling” a lot, same as I call my kids. I am what I am. Older. Wiser. Sparkly.

My hair has a shocking amount of silver, so much so that my little 4-year-old neighbor innocently asked, “Did snow fall on your head?” I waited a beat and said, “No. My hair is sparkly now.""My mom and sister are both redheads. Neither has gone gray the way I have. Mom's hair is strawberry blonde now, and my sister barely has any gray in her dark red hair. Me? I'm my father's child. I started going gray when I was 19, and after I had my kids, I don't think a single brown hair grew on my head again. Twenty years is a long time to pretend you're not aging.I like my silvery hair. I really do. I like being in my 50s, being proud of theadults my kids have become. I like being old enough to know things. The map of my life is written on my face in the wrinkles there, and I like it. I like being confident enough, after a mere four decades of playing with makeup, to wear bright red lipstick.And, strangely enough, men seem to notice me again. I think it's the laissez-faire attitude. Let's say the Popeye philosophy of “I am what I am.” The other day, as I was walking through Manhattan, a very young, very handsome shirtless Apollo of a man made a wonderful clicking sound and said, “Hey there, mami.""""Why hello!” said I. “Tell your mother she raised you right.” Oh shush, feminists! Feminism is about choice, and I chose to be utterly delighted at this young man's attention. Was he pity-flirting? I didn't care! He saw me. He saw a woman who was clearly middle-aged, slightly overweight, dressed in sensible shoes with silvery hair and a smile, and he clicked at me and made my frickin’ day.Later that same day, I was battling the barbarian hordes of Times Square on my way back to the hotel, and I caught eyes with a very tall, good-looking man probably in his 40s. He waved his finger up and down at me and said, “Fabulous!""Fabulous? “Thank you, sweetheart!” I said in my momlike way. Was he gay? Probably! And heck, even better, right? I mean, if a gay man thinks you're fabulous, who are you to question that?I've been a writer for a long time now. Nineteen books, the first of which came out when I was 41. I'm older than many women in my industry, and I'm hearing things like, “I want to be you when I grow up” and “I've been reading you since I was in high school.” I don't worry about who does or doesn't like me, and I find myself calling younger writers “sweetheart” and “darling” a lot, same as I call my kids. I am what I am. Older. Wiser. Sparkly. You can see it from a mile away.New York Times best-selling author Kristan Higgins's new novel,Life and Other Inconveniences, is a story of love, loss and redemption..

",8/7/2020,A Gynecologist Answers Your Most Burning Menopause Questions,"Who knew we’d actually be nostalgic for those sex ed classes? Sure, they were awkward, but at least we were literally schooled on the ABCs surrounding our hormonal cycles. Decades later, we’re seemingly back to square one, wondering why our bodies and moods have once again started to betray us. And judging by the reaction of our loved ones, we’re not the only ones impacted by the changes.Make no mistake: The confusion and frustration about perimenopause and menopause are real. “Women are often in the dark because the symptoms aren’t that well understood,” says Sara Gottfried, a San Francisco-based gynecologist and best-selling author. (Her latest book,Brain Body Diet, was released March 5). “When we’re younger, we think of menopause as some cliff we must drop off from when we turn 50. The truth is, there’s a long preparation that our bodies go through before our final menstrual cycle.”To find out more, Gottfried answered our, uh, burning questions.What is really happening to me on the inside?Five hormones are in flux during perimenopause: estrogen, progesterone, cortisol, thyroid and testosterone (factor in insulin and leptin as well if there is weight gain). Perimenopause — the years of hormonal upheaval before the final menstrual period — begins with dropping progesterone levels and ends with dropping estrogen. During the first phase of perimenopause a woman runs out of ripe eggs and “the hallmark is shorter cycles and heavier bleeding,” Gottfried says. The second phase is defined by lower estrogen and skipped cycles. Despite the perception that there’s a continuous decline in estrogen en route to menopause, “it can fluctuate wildly,” she notes. In fact, excess estrogen is the reason why women experience breast discomfort.For the sake of my loves ones, how can I get a handle on my moodiness?Remember when you raged at your parents as a teen? During perimenopause, your partner and/or children become those public enemies. That’s because of heightened PMS symptoms from estrogen (read: irritability, anxiety, depression) and our rising stress levels from cortisol. Even more disheartening, the old methods of coping — a glass of wine and chocolate — won’t help because alcohol and caffeine raise cortisol levels and disrupt sleep . . . leading to more stress. Gottfried recommends prioritizing a deep sleep. “You need a minimum of 90 minutes every night [of deep sleep] so your brain gets refreshed and you can reduce anxiety and depression,” she says. Devices such as a Fitbit Versa can help track your zzz's.How long will the mood swings last?Good news: Menopause will resolve the moodiness. Bad news: The path to menopause can last up to a full decade. But regular exercise can reverse the trend of estrogen dominance, which can help your mood under stress. Foods with the fatty acid phosphatidylserine, such as soy beans, carrots and cabbage, can also improve your mood. Most important? “Having an honest discussion with your spouse and children about what you’re experiencing can nurture understanding,” she says. “It’s especially important to talk to your partner about a lower libido to help restore a loving relationship.”Ugh, I just stained my sheets. Why is the bleeding so heavy now and when will it stop?The excessive — and sometimes annoyingly constant — bleeding could be due to estrogen dominance, fibroids or even endometriosis. And though diet changes, exercise and supplements can deter the symptoms, Gottfried advises women to tread carefully and talk to their doctor for peace of mind. “Anyone with bleeding that occurs more frequently than 21 days, or heavy bleeding soaking a pad or tampon in less than three hours or bleeding that persists for seven days or longer should seek medical attention,” she cautions.What can I do about hot flashes?Once again, hormones are to blame. “The accompanying changes in hormones as the switch occurs from one menstrual cycle to the next can make the symptoms like hot flashes worse,” Gottfried says. They’re especially noticeable in the week leading up to your period because of the decline in progesterone. To help reduce the intensity of feeling like you’re in a sauna, try paced respiration: Breathe deeply for 20 minutes twice per day with a five-second inhale, a 10-second hold and a five-second exhale.Will my skin ever look dewy again?The problem is estrogen. Its reduction at menopause decreases the moisture content of the skin and its elasticity, leading to an increase inwrinkling and sagging, sigh. Lowered estrogen adds up to a decrease in skin collagen as well. But hope is not lost! “You can slow the skin-aging process by encouraging collagen to flourish in your body,” says Gottfried. For starters, instead of that a.m. caffeine fix, try a collagen latte: 1 cup of decaffeinated coffee or tea, 1-2 tablespoons of collagen powder and 1 tablespoon of coconut oil. Blend until frothy!Name one positive about the road to menopause. Go.As you stop juggling fluctuating hormones, “I believe perimenopause and menopause are the end of the accommodation that women are taught to do,” Gottfried notes. That means speaking your truth and stopping that need to feel responsible for the happiness of others. Besides, “So much of how you age is down to how well you take care of your health,” she adds. “If you take the steps to balance your hormones with how you eat, sleep, move and think, menopause can represent the start of a new phase of life rather than the end of one.” That’s better.","Who knew we’d actually be nostalgic for those sex ed classes?

",18-08-2020,The Evolution of a Fabulous Long Friendship,"The 2020 school closings and openings take me back to 1953 to first grade and a life-changing experience.At my dentist’s office for a checkup, I saw a picture of his cute, smiling daughter, Sally. He said she also would start first grade at PS #66 in Mrs. Miller’s class. Fearful of sitting at a desk all day — and not knowing which of my kindergarten classmates, if any, would be there — I rejoiced.Arriving early and recognizing Sally when she appeared, I motioned her to the desk I saved across from mine. “Are you Dr. Berman’s little girl?”She smiled easily, maybe because she also wanted to meet me, and possibly because my calling her a little girl amused her. We laughed at something Mrs. Miller said. We were the only ones. At recess we went to the playground together, and virtually everywhere else for years, sometimes in identical clothing — including blue and white middy blouses and black pedal pushers to perform “Side by Side” at our charity carnival at her house.Our classmates labeled us “the twins.”I knew we were not exactly alike. Relatives and unrelated grownups called Sally “cute” and “pretty” and me “good in math.” I swallowedthat.I loved our performances, imaginary worlds, made-up words and mischief. The day after Mary Martin flew across television screens as Peter Pan, Sally and I dragged her family’s housekeeper to the rec room, stood her on an expensive chair and attached a rope to the ceiling, tying the other end around her waist. She did not fly. The chair we broke was unfixable.At day camp, I overheard a male counselor tell ours that Sally was adorable. I pushed “little adorable” into the lake. By accident, I claimed. At age 11, when she came to my overnight camp, boys who had ignored me suddenly surrounded me the first night, wanting to meet my friend. My friend. What possessed me to share My Camp? Why, back home, did boys at dancing school race across the floor to Sally?Our distance widened in high school, as boys flocked to carry her books while I had lots of books to carry, and she became a cheerleader and loved partying. I did neither. In college, New York City and I became a fit. Sally became a Hare Krishna. Her boyfriend became her husband and a Krishna leader.“The music’s pretty. No meat is fine, but no sex?” my father said. “Imagine others’ rules governing your life.”I couldn’t. Not communal living, either. At age 38, Sally abandoned the orange robe. Divorced, still a Krishna, still exuding warmth and eager to get together — as was I, she visited. We picked up some pieces, not all. As a divorced single mother, teacher, writer, veteran of psychotherapy and happy with the life I created, I felt older. It irked me that she dallied dressing to go out, seemingly unaware of time and my waiting. It irked me, too, that she wanted to attend my class and did not understand my refusal and the confidentiality and trust with my students, whose personal writing and struggles were not to be shared. But our reminiscing, giggling and mainly not mincing words made me feel close to her. Bonded.After a brief time unattached, Sally dated Ben, who had loved her at camp. She moved to his Portland home with her children and married him. When I mentioned I visit my college roommate, Helen, in Portland yearly, she said, “Stay with me.”“No. We’ll play.” I reminded her she dawdled, and I wanted meals at a reasonable hour. Sally wore diamond stud earrings and looked very put-together when she and her family had dinner at Helen’s. We performed “Side by Side,” and laughed at things no one else found funny.“Mom talks about the great times you had together,” her daughter said. “You bring out each other’s spirit.”Years later, at a Portland bookstore event for my bookWriting from Personal Experience, Sally —  without asking — plopped herself beside me at the front table. Huh? “Go sit in the audience.”“I’ve known you forever. I should be up here,” she said. I told her to keep quiet during my presentation, then help me sell my book. She did. And I say nothing whenever she repeats a story. And nothing about the gap in our looks no longer existing. Or at least not in my eyes.In New York for our friend’s 50th birthday bash, Sally stayed with me and listened while I rehearsed the speech I was nervous to give. Walking up Park Avenue to the party backward like we used to walk to PS #66, sitting there together and seeing Sally smile when I spoke made me feel at home.When my father died, I called Sally right away. Her Krishna belief in an afterlife comforted me. So did her late-night reminders that “he’s in a better place” — knowing the challenges he had faced with my cognitively impaired mother. I asked her to help me clean out my father’s Florida closet, arranging a time when she would be at her mother’s nearby.When we finished, she accompanied me to the nursing home to see my mother. “Remember me?” Sally asked, bending over the wheelchair with a long, warm hug. “Remember you?” Mom said. “You two play together.” We do. We do.","The 2020 school closings and openings take me back to 1953 to first grade and a life-changing experience.At my dentist’s office for a checkup, I saw a picture of his cute, smiling daughter, Sally.

",4/11/2020,Why Grandparents Can — and Should — Leave the Parenting to Their Kids,"Grandparents are often considered a family’s source of wisdom. Most have learned a lot over their years of hard work, particularly in the parenting department. Raising their own kids into adulthood was no quick and easy accomplishment, so it’s natural for grandparents to feel they have expertise to impart on the subject of child-rearing. Yet times have changed, and the parenting styles and techniques today can seem ineffective or not strict enough. Grandparents may want to share their own ideas about parenting, particularly if they see an area of concern with a child’s behavior or well-being. But there may be a cost to getting involved with how grandkids are brought up. Nobody enjoys family tensions and divisions. Is there a “right” way or time to give parenting advice and still avoid family conflict?Before discussing parenting with their adult kids, grandparents first need to reflect on their reasons for doing so.“As long as the children are safe (no physical or emotional abuse), it's up to individual parents to decide what's best for their children,” explains Nicole Arzt, a licensed marriage and family therapist in Fullerton, California. “Seniors need to remind themselves that these aren’t their children. This can be hard; after all, they only want to help. Constantly bringing up how they disagree on something or how they would do things differently may create resentment between their adult children and them. It may impact the relationship they have with their grandchildren.” (Obviously physical or emotional abuse should always be dealt with by professionals trained to help and protect children.) Arzt raises an interesting question, though. Is it helpful versus overstepping boundaries? Perhaps there’s more behind a grandparent’s desire to weigh in.Leela Magavi, a physician and regional medical director forCommunity Psychiatrysays,  “Disparate parenting styles may induce anxiety in grandparents, and may lead to feelings of isolation and sadness. One of the most anxiety-inducing things an aging individual can experience is the loss of control. It is pivotal for grandparents to maintain their own identities and remain engaged in hobbies and their passions beyond just being a grandparent.”Clearly an active lifestyle with interests outside of their children and grandkids has multiple benefits to seniors themselves. Arzt recommends having a journal, or a therapist, as well as friends of a similar age range, particularly if grandparents need to grouse about their kids and grandkids with others who are likely to understand without being offended. However, grandparents also need to be sensitive to the needs and desires of their adult children and grandkids – there may still be specific times when their input actuallyiswanted or needed.Richard C. Horowitz, co-founder ofGrowing Great Relationships, a coaching/training practice, and author of the book,“Family Centered Parenting - Your Guide For Growing Great Families”advocates open communication and suggests, “If an [adult] child complains about the behavior of a grandchild, it would be OK to say, ‘Would you like any suggestions from me?’”When or if adult kids voluntarily seek advice, it’s received better as a suggestion or an “I found this worked for me as a parent” angle rather than as harsh criticism of current parental tactics. An occasional request for counsel doesn’t mean the door is permanently open for unsolicited opinions, though. Grandparents may have been invited to weigh in only on that specific topic shared and should respect that. If grandkids tell grandparents they’re upset with their parents, it’s better to suggest some approaches the grandchild can try to work out the matter with his or her parents independently if possible. Dangerous situations (like a pool gate left unlatched) also warrant grandparents speaking up, confirms Horowitz.Paul Greene, a psychologist and director at theManhattan Center for Cognitive-Behavioral Therapyin New York, has some helpful tips for grandparents. He advises: Pick your battles. If you offer nonstop parenting advice, it's more likely to be ignored.Practice acceptance. The reality is that your ability to impact your kids' parenting style at this point is limited. Viewing the situation as one you need to ""fix"" is likely to lead to unhappiness on both ends.Offer genuine praise for what you appreciate about your kids' parenting. This will help your suggestions be heard, and help your overall relationship too. What if seniors feel they’re entitled to have a say because their kids and grandkids are receiving financial benefit from them, which is becoming more common in the current economy?Raffi Bilek, family therapist and director atBaltimore Therapy Centersays, “It’s important for grandparents to recognize what is and is not in their control. If you are providing financial support and are not happy with where the money is going (e.g., video games instead of school supplies) you have the option of not sending money. That's in your control. What your children do with their own kids is not really in your control. If you're looking to be able toinfluencethe situation, you first have to come to terms with the fact that you can'tcontrolit.” Influence is always more easily accepted coming from a positive approach, Bilek counsels.What about when grandkids are alone with grandparents? Who’s in charge then? Greene says, “Be the fun-loving grandparents you are, andbe considerate of how your decisions will affect the parents. You'll set a powerful and healthy example for your grandkids. It's important to follow the parents' rules around bedtimes, especially if the parents are the ones who will need to deal with the kids the next day. It's okay to have your own rules for the kids in your own home, unless it clearly violates the wishes of the parents. You don't want to set an example of defying the parents' authority. Instead, set a healthy example of mature negotiation with the parents when it's necessary.”Dianne Grande, a psychologist in Batavia, Illinois and writer with Choosing Therapy, urges grandparents, “Let your adult children make their own mistakes — just like you did!”Perfection is not a necessity to raise well-rounded and compassionate children, says Magavi, so seniors can go easy on their adult kids trying to parent as best they can. Grandparents can simply enjoy their grandkids free of the responsibilities of raising them. The kids are no doubt already fantastic young people grandparents adore — even if they are parented differently than grandparents think they should be — and that’s what matters most.","Grandparents are often considered a family’s source of wisdom.

If you are providing financial support and are not happy with where the money is going (e.g., video games instead of school supplies) you have the option of not sending money. That's in your control. What your children do with their own kids is not really in your control. If you're looking to be able toinfluencethe situation, you first have to come to terms with the fact that you can'tcontrolit.” Influence is always more easily accepted coming from a positive approach, Bilek counsels.What about when grandkids are alone with grandparents? Who’s in charge then? Greene says, “Be the fun-loving grandparents you are, andbe considerate of how your decisions will affect the parents. You'll set a powerful and healthy example for your grandkids. It's important to follow the parents' rules around bedtimes, especially if the parents are the ones who will need to deal with the kids the next day. It's okay to have your own rules for the kids in your own home, unless it clearly violates the wishes of the parents. You don't want to set an example of defying the parents' authority. Instead, set a healthy example of mature negotiation with the parents when it's necessary.”Dianne Grande, a psychologist in Batavia, Illinois and writer with Choosing Therapy, urges grandparents, “Let your adult children make their own mistakes — just like you did!”Perfection is not a necessity to raise well-rounded and compassionate children, says Magavi, so seniors can go easy on their adult kids trying to parent as best they can. Grandparents can simply enjoy their grandkids free of the responsibilities of raising them. The kids are no doubt already fantastic young people grandparents adore — even if they are parented differently than grandparents think they should be — and that’s what matters most."

",12/4/2021,How You Can Fight Against Hair Loss,"Hair loss is a lonely battle. It can be embarrassing, so much so that it's often hard to ask for help. Many women notice changes during menopause, when hair may become finer and thinner. It might begin to feel more like baby hair. This happens because with age, hair follicles shrink. Hair grows more slowly and falls out more easily. It may lose some of its original density.Some women, however, don’t need to wait for menopause. Genetics, some medications, hormonal fluctuations and stress can be culprits in hair loss. So are thyroid disorders, autoimmune conditions and vitamin deficiencies. Hair loss is difficult to diagnose on your own, so it's helpful to speak to a doctor. A well-trained physician can analyze your pattern of hair loss and offer suggestions.Common Causes of Hair Loss——Telogen effluviam: If you have been fortunate to enjoy a thick head of hair most of your life and a sudden event causes an undue amount of stress, your hair may react by prematurely entering a stage called telogen effluvium. This is the phase of your hair’s growth cycle when natural shedding occurs. In times of stress overload, however, this stage may be jump-started. Instead of normal hair loss, you may suddenly start seeing hair everywhere: in your sink or on the pages of the book you’re reading. In difficult times like these, it’s not surprising for some women to find a lot of hair in the shower drain. If stress is causing this, it helps to know it will pass. It's important to note that the trigger can occur several months before the hair loss, and that it usually resolves within months. If you’re very concerned, check with a doctor. A dermatologist can be a good option, but other medical doctors specialize in hair loss.——Female-pattern hair loss:Female-pattern hair loss (FPHL) affects millions of women, so you are not alone. The first signs of FPHL are often a widening part or the impression that your hair doesn't feel as thick as it once did. The condition is hereditary and is more common after menopause, meaning hormones play a role.Typical SolutionsIf you’ve read this far, chances are you are hoping this article will offer some solutions other than the usual ones: Eat a balanced diet, try over-the-counter medications such as Rogaine 2% or 5% minoxidil topical solution, or take supplements such as biotin, Viviscal or Nutrofol. Or look into buying a wig or undergoing hair transplantation. All of these can help some women. But if you need more options, here’s what to know.——Experimental/off-label procedures:New procedures have helped thousands of women and men, and more are on the horizon. While not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), some of these procedures harness your own body to help interrupt the shedding process and help grow back your own hair. When choosing a physician, do plenty of research.—Platelet-rich plasma (PRP):Not all physicians perform this procedure in the same way, so results vary. In PRP, your own blood is drawn and centrifuged (spun around in a machine to siphon off the platelets). Some doctors add a substance called ACell to provide a quasi-scaffold for the platelets to adhere to. Your doctor will go over your scalp with a small roller full of tiny needles in a process called microneedling. (You won't feel a thing; local anesthesia is used.) This prepares your scalp to receive the platelets. The idea behind PRP is your body is tricked out of thinking your hair loss is chronic and ignoring it. Instead it perceives the microneedling as a new injury and rushes platelets and growth factor to your scalp to help repair it. If this treatment works for you, you may see regrowth in anywhere from two to six months.If you opt for PRP, ask the doctor if he or she performs microneedling, and whether anything is added to the PRP to increase its effectiveness.——Exosomes:The use of exosomes represents an exciting new technique that some hair-loss specialists are using. Exosomes are small, single-membrane, cell-like vesicles enriched in selected proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and other substances. They may be derived from many parts of the body, but results may vary depending on where they are extracted from. Renowned New York City hair-loss specialist Robin Unger, M.D., explains, “I have seen the best results with exosomes derived from mesenchymal cells extracted from bone-marrow donors. While still experimental, this technique offers very promising help to many patients and it is very simple to perform.” Depending on where you live, you may need to travel to find a qualified professional. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), or stromal stem cells, can differentiate into many different types of cells within the body, including hair cells. Don’t be afraid to ask a lot of questions.Patients with chronic illness or over a certain age may see better results with exosomes rather than with PRP. But then again not all exosomes are optimal. If you decide that exosome treatment is right for you, make sure to ask what part of the body the cells come from, as they can be harvested from placenta, marrow or other sites.""It is significant to point out that PRP is not permanent,"" Unger says. “You may have to refresh it every year. We don’t really know yet how long exosomes will last.” But the good news is that there are new possibilities where only a few years ago not much existed. Don’t lose hope.As always, consult your own doctor before trying any new procedure.","Hair loss is a lonely battle.

",7/6/2021,Surviving Being an Older Father Because of a Wise Wife,"Every Father's Day, I have flashbacks of the 2000 U.S. presidential election campaign's final days and averting what would have caused a lifetime of regret: not being with my wife, Maureen, for the birth of our son, Hank.With an increasing number of older women becoming mothers and older men becoming fathers, I was about to become a first-time dad at 52. But I wasn't quite ready. As a political reporter for Reuters, I needed at least a few more days.On Sunday, November 5, 2000, however — two days before voters went to the polls to decide between Democratic Vice President Al Gore and Texas Republican Governor George W. Bush as leader of the free world — my very pregnant wife shocked me.Maureen wasn’t due for another 17 days, but in a phone call from our Maryland home she said, “I may have the baby early.”“Oh, no,” I thought, sitting in the press bus of the Gore operation, then in Philadelphia, about to begin another day of campaigning. Polls showed Gore and Bush in a razor-close race.Maureen told me she seemed to be having labor pains. The baby might come soon. Any day. She made it clear she was nervous but didn't ask me to come home.I didn't want to leave the campaign. I had been covering it for a year, and Reuters had spent a ton for me to travel with Gore aboard Air Force Two — from New York City to Los Angeles, with countless stops in between. I'd feel guilty and disappointed by bailing out now.And I figured Maureen could handle it. She's smart and strong. She owned and ran a jewelry store, and before we wed in February, she was a single mom raising two young children.As Maureen spoke, I scrutinized Gore's schedule, which showed he'd be in his home state of Tennessee on Tuesday, where he would vote and await election returns.But Election Day came and went without a winner and without Maureen giving birth. More than three weeks later — amid a recount fight with Bush, up by only 537 votes in Florida, the state that would determine the election — she had our baby, on December 1.I was there when Hank arrived at 11:48 p.m. ET — 10 pounds, 15 ounces. At that moment — with our baby red-faced and crying, and Maureen sobbing and smiling — I knew I had erred in not coming home sooner.After covering big stories and traveling much of the country and the world for three decades, I was about to discover the most meaningful and challenging world of all — that of our child and all that came with him.Within minutes of Hank's bursting into our lives, I developed a new appreciation for mothers. It's a 24/7 job like no other and more important than any other.With the love of a mother, Maureen taught me all about parenthood — from 3 a.m. feedings and diaper changes to pacing the kitchen at midnight, waiting for a teenage Hank to drive home from a date.I also learned that being a father is far more rewarding than covering a campaign. I discovered that hosting your child's birthday party at a bowling alley beats going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I found that taking photos of your son’s high school graduation is more exciting than getting your picture taken with a president.And hearing Hank tell me ""I love you"" and ""Thanks, Dad"" is far better than any editor ever telling me ""Great story"" or ""Nice lead."" In 2012, for the first time in my career, I didn't ask to cover a presidential campaign. I didn't want to miss a day with my fast-growing son.The only drawback to being an older father is that many people have assumed, over the years, that I'm Hank's grandfather — particularly at his youth soccer and basketball games. I'm older than some of Hank's friends' grandfathers. But Hank doesn't seem to mind.Just days after Hank's birth, I answered the phone in our suddenly louder home.""Hello, this is the White House,"" the caller announced. ""Please hold for the vice president of the United States.""""Hello, Tom,"" Al Gore said. ""I hear you and Maureen just had a baby boy. Congratulations!""""Thank you, Mr. Vice President. We really appreciate your call,” I said. Then I quickly went back to holding my beautiful little boy.Maureen and I didn't plan to have Hank. But if we had, if I had done research, I would have had concerns. As with older mothers, babies of older fathers are more apt to have health problems at birth. I knew there could be problems because of Maureen's age, 40. But I didn't realize my age could also be a reason to worry.That worry was put to rest. Our big baby is now a big and healthy college sophomore, 6 feet 1 inch, 195 pounds. In high school, Hank made the honor roll and was a three-year starter on the basketball team.Yes, I became one of those annoying braggart fathers, a surprise since, earlier in life, while in other relationships, I wasn’t focused on getting married and having a child. I was more interested in being a reporter, free to accept any assignment and go anywhere.I didn't know what I was missing.As a bonus to getting Hank, in marrying Maureen, I also got two great stepchildren — Flynn and Callie, now 30 and 26 — a big brother and a big sister, ideal role models for Hank.I got a family.Every Father's Day, I call my good friend Iris, who introduced me to Maureen in 1997 on their mutual birthday, August 31.""Thanks again, Iris, for helping me become a father and have a far more meaningful life,"" I say. ""Hank thanks you, too.""","Every Father's Day, I have flashbacks of the 2000 U.S. presidential election campaign's final days and averting what would have caused a lifetime of regret: not being with my wife, Maureen, for the birth of our son, Hank.With an increasing number of older women becoming mothers and older men becoming fathers, I was about to become a first-time dad at 52.

",23-08-2021,The Best Part of Being 60-Something,"You do you. Women of all ages are told this via female-directed websites, magazines and self-help books.

",30-08-2021,How 'The Golden Girls' Revamped My Menopausal Sex Life,"I have been shocked out of a postmenopausal complacency about sex from watching vintage episodes ofThe Golden Girls,which aired on NBC from 1985 to 1992.That is a sentence I never, ever thought I would write.Like many comedies and dramedies,The Golden Girlstackled some serious real-world issues shrouded in irony, laughter and jokes. I didn’t tune in for every episode, but it was a reliable late-night standby, a companion after a double shift at a restaurant, eating a not-so-good frozen pizza, finally able to rest.What I didn’t expect when I began rewatching the series (pandemic binge-watching being the thing to do) was how the sassy character Blanche Devereaux would affect me.Played by Rue McClanahan, Blanche is a complicated, somewhat problematic TV character, especially when viewed through a modern lens. She’s proudly from plantation-style Southern roots, refers to people from the North as Yankees and has some opinions that are not only not progressive but also bigoted, such as her difficulty in accepting that one of her siblings is gay. But much like Karen Walker fromWill & Grace,Blanche is more of a caricature—a judgmental conservative who often changes her beliefs once she opens her heart to people who are different.But Blanche is also the pink flamingo of the pack of gal pals living in a Miami home—bold, bright and beautiful—with what we assume are (allegedly) enviably long and frequent orgasms. Where Karen Walker dotes on alcohol, Blanche loves sex. She wears eye-catching, flamboyant outfits that accentuate her body, instead of hiding its aging status. She is unabashedly flirtatious with every man and is proud of being a sexually active “older” person. Older is in quotes because Blanche, the youngest of the ladies, is estimated to be52at the show’s inception.I am also 52. I don’t feel like an “old” lady who would find it normal to live with three other senior citizens in a sleepy retirement community. But seniors are no longer expected to do nothing but play bridge or shuffleboard. With life expectancy rising, people over 50 live more active, engaged lives than ever before.Tell that to my libido, which began to fizzle throughout the hell of perimenopause. Hot flashes, lack of sleep and belly weight gain do not make you feel sexy.Sex has been a huge part of my identity. Like Blanche, I am known to be flirtatious with people of all genders (I’m pansexual). When I think back on my rich sexual history, I’ve had some encounters that would probably make even Blanche blush. But the march through menopause all but snuffed out that spark.The loss of estrogen does amazingly cruel things. I’m fatter, grayer, more wrinkled. My skin is rough in some places and puckering in others. I look at pictures of myself from only 10 years ago and can’t fathom what happened.I began raising concerns about my sporadic, beginning-to-sag libido with my gynecologist years ago. I am not a candidate for hormone replacement therapy, and herbal remedies have had limited success. In my mind, I still love sex and find all kinds of people attractive and sexy. I flirt with my partner, and we have always been affectionate, but getting things going has been like trying to start a jet engine with a rubber band and a string.Watching Blanche breeze into a room has been a revelation. Blanche doesn’t have a “perfect” body. She never pretends to be anything other than what she is—old, bold and beautiful. She embraces every curve, showing off her cleavage, playing up her assets, and is always proud of her erotic appeal and love of sexual activity.In most episodes, Blanche appears at least once in some sort of lingerie or enticing robe, even if she isn’t entertaining that night.I decided to embrace my inner Blanche. Too ashamed to take my body to a store where I’d have to strip down in front of those horrible mirrors, a mask hiding the aging face I could barely stand to look at any longer, I started ordering negligees, teddies, sexy robes and underwear online that I could try on in the privacy of my home.There are many beautiful, well-fitting items to accommodate my postmenopausal size. Cuts and styles that look great and make me feel beautiful again. I told my partner about embracing my inner Blanche—he’s been completely supportive, and the results have been awesome.I have a whole drawer of “Blanche outfits” and when I change into those clothes, the old, alluring me comes alive. I once again take great delight in seeing, out of the corner of my eye, a flash of lace or a piece of silk moving rhythmically when we get busy. I clutch a handful of satin while delightfully dirty things are done to me by my partner. I parade around (when my kid isn’t here or when he’s sleeping) getting a nightcap or making an evening herbal tea, my partner’s eyes following my every step, making me feel like getting sweaty with him.Sometimes I even adopt a Southern drawl and mimic the way Blanche sashays when she walks. Yes, I’m weird. Fortunately, my open-minded, loving life partner is also weird, and he’s all for it. It’s working for us. Get some Blanche clothes and see if it works for you.","I have been shocked out of a postmenopausal complacency about sex from watching vintage episodes ofThe Golden Girls,which aired on NBC from 1985 to 1992.That is a sentence I never, ever thought I would write.Like many comedies and dramedies,The Golden Girlstackled some serious real-world issues shrouded in irony, laughter and jokes.

",13-09-2021,My Husband and I Have a Great New Way to Bond,"In the darkness, my eyes flip open. A sudden alertness in my brain informs me that, for its own inscrutable reasons, my body is done with sleep for now. Glancing at the clock, which registers a depressing 3:12 a.m., I notice that my husband’s side of the bed is empty. Time for another pre-dawn rendezvous.I pad downstairs in my bathrobe, a pool of light from the living room illuminating my way. Sure enough, there’s my husband on the couch, his curly hair rumpled, reading glasses perched on his nose, a biography of Meriwether Lewis open on his lap. He looks up resignedly. “You, too?” I nod. “Me, too.”For years the medical issues in my marriage tended to stay separate. Pregnancy, childbirth and the odd inconclusive mammogram were my department. My husband dealt with back pain, tendonitis and a bike injury. But a funny thing happened as we hit our 50s: Our ailments began aligning. First I got reading glasses, then he did. We both began feeling creakier in the mornings. And then the insomnia started.Between us, we’ve tried all the remedies: staying off screens before bedtime, avoiding red wine, a white noise machine. I recommend them all. But when they don’t work, like tonight, I recommend a different approach: staying up together. Being awake in the middle of the night is depressing, but it doesn’t have to be lonely. And with a little understanding, two grumpy people can even find something to smile about. Now, as I join my husband on the couch, I want to complain. I want to mutter darkly about my doctor, who tempered her sympathy by noting matter-of-factly that sleeplessness “just tends to occur” after menopause — for more than half of us.The Study of Women’s Health Across the Nation shows “that the prevalence of sleep disturbance increases with increasing age. The prevalence in the premenopausal age group ranges from 16 percent to 42 percent; in perimenopausal women prevalence varies from 39 percent to 47 percent; in postmenopausal females, the prevalence ranges from 35 percent to 60 percent.”The first rule of getting along at 3 a.m. is empathy. My husband has clearly been awake longer than I have, and during our 26 years together, I’ve learned that for him, talking about physical problems only exacerbates them.“How many hours did you get?” I ask. It’s the only question he is willing to answer about the state of his sleep.“Four,” he says flatly.I take his hand. “Poor sweetie.”“At least I’m not trying to sleep in the rain, like these guys,” he says, gesturing to his book. He gives my hand a squeeze. “And I’ve got a nice warm wife to snuggle up with.”Snuggling is all we have the energy for right now, but when staying up together, who doesn’t appreciate being reminded that someone else considers them hot stuff?I roll my eyes but smile back at him. Pulling a quilt over us, I am thankful that after a year cooped up in this small house, we still like each other. The house is quiet, the only sound a faint hum from the refrigerator.“You know why you wake up so much?” my husband asks. I know exactly what he’s going to say, but if your guy is trying to cheer you up at three in the morning, you let him do his shtick.“Tell me.”“You don’t eat enough cereal.”A bowl of cereal before bed is my husband’s cherished evening ritual. Toasty Multi-Grain Squares didn’t avert insomnia tonight, but I refrain from pointing this out. “You’re so right. Definitely trying that tomorrow.” I laugh as he elbows me in mock outrage.Most nights, after warm milk with honey or reading until we feel sleepy, we go back upstairs together and manage to drift off again. But sometimes sleep eludes one of us. I tend to keep trying anyway; my husband prefers to accept his wakeful fate.Now he sets his book down with a thud, saying “What kind of scones do you want, raspberry or blueberry?” Yes, he actually bakes scones. Or muffins. Baking is his insomniac activity. I’m baffled by my husband’s yen for insomniac productivity. I used to try convincing him to come back to bed, but we’ve learned the importance of respecting each other’s middle-of-the-night survival tactics. Besides, how can I complain when his coping strategy involves baking?I lean into him and sigh. At some point I will attempt to sleep again. If I succeed, I will awaken to the smell of warm scones drifting up the stairs.I’m not sleepy enough to go back to bed, though. Not yet. I pull the quilt more snugly around us, remembering my husband’s insistence on getting up at night to change diapers when our children were babies so I could snooze just a bit longer. Later, I wrangled two kids under 5 during his long hours of weekend fieldwork in graduate school. A united front and our deep affection have seen us through middle school drama, teenage shenanigans, the isolation and sorrow of the pandemic — and now, these wakeful nights.Soon I will try to summon slumber one more time. For now, I wordlessly rest my head on my husband’s shoulder. As we sit in the pre-dawn quiet, I realize that by simply sharing our sleeplessness rather than retreating irritably to separate rooms, my husband and I have been unconsciously deepening our relationship, and all during a time we would least expect to.Take that, insomnia.","In the darkness, my eyes flip open.

96,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/lessons-i-learned-from-my-french-grandmothers-woods
",25-10-2021,Lessons I Learned From My French Grandmother’s Woods,"As a child, I loved Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and they made perfect sense. After all, my grandma lived in a little château in France.To visit her I crossed some woods, called La Garenne, and then trekked to the ancient farmhouse where I spent weekends. From grandeur to green darkness, La Garenne was the transitional space after the light and noise of the family living room.In the beginning, the woods seemed static. They were old and scraggly. Countless family feet had left roots and rocks exposed, making it easy to trip. My grandmother Nicole also seemed unchanging when I was little. She was very short and energetic, smelling of Chanel No. 5, Olay cream and Royale Bleue cigarettes. She wore cashmere sweaters, pearls and oversized green rain boots to garden and walk the muddy forest. The story of her life was the story of a woman who cared for others, with a warm smile and sparkling, playful eyes. Author's grandmother, Nicole Like my grandmother, the woods were both wildly familiar and full of secrets. When I was a 10-year-old carrying a wicker basket, my grandmother showed me how to look for mushrooms in hollows at the foot of trees and under matted leaves — telling me to leave one mushroom behind so more could grow.In and out of the woods, my grandmother knew all the secrets, unlatching concealed compartments in our heirloom secretary’s desk. Then she would open a hinged box full of Russian bonds issued by the czar before the revolution, one of the ways we had lost our family money.As in any popular fairy tale, our château symbolized romance. It was a wedding gift for my great-grandmother, and as a teen, I roamed into the ivy, walking carefully around holly, until I found what I called Sleeping Beauty’s Alley. Often, I went to this natural arcade made of overarching trees with a soft ivy carpet on the ground and green light streaming in.Grandma Nicole was playful but private. Though my grandparents were devout Catholics, as a teen I finally did the math — my father’s birth was less than nine months after the wedding. When I asked them, my grandfather said, “The Church has always understood the sins of the flesh.” I joked that everyone was amazed at her premature baby’s plump cheeks. I imagined her as an 18-year-old, forced into marriage after she got pregnant, dreaming of an independent life. Later my great-aunt told me about the party when my future grandparents had slept together. They had been pressured to marry by their proper bourgeois families.A complicated love had developed between my playful grandma and my serious grandfather. She had stayed in the marriage, after all. I was the first of the 40-some grandchildren. We each experienced my grandmother’s kindness, restless energy and occasional sharpness. After each shouting fit, she would take to her bed. Of course, the queen could also be a witch.Like Grandma Nicole, La Garenne was sometimes easy to experience, like in summertime, when the breeze rose late in the day. At other times, I trudged through the woods in a downpour, slipping every other step.My life was shaped by peace. My grandmother’s youth took place during World War II.

Yet, my grandma is indelible, in her oversized green gardening boots, walking among her roses.","As a child, I loved Grimm’s Fairy Tales, and they made perfect sense. After all, my grandma lived in a little château in France.To visit her I crossed some woods, called La Garenne, and then trekked to the ancient farmhouse where I spent weekends. From grandeur to green darkness, La Garenne was the transitional space after the light and noise of the family living room.In the beginning, the woods seemed static. They were old and scraggly. Countless family feet had left roots and rocks exposed, making it easy to trip. My grandmother Nicole also seemed unchanging when I was little. She was very short and energetic, smelling of Chanel No. 5, Olay cream and Royale Bleue cigarettes. She wore cashmere sweaters, pearls and oversized green rain boots to garden and walk the muddy forest. The story of her life was the story of a woman who cared for others, with a warm smile and sparkling, playful eyes. Author's grandmother, Nicole Like my grandmother, the woods were both wildly familiar and full of secrets. When I was a 10-year-old carrying a wicker basket, my grandmother showed me how to look for mushrooms in hollows at the foot of trees and under matted leaves — telling me to leave one mushroom behind so more could grow.In and out of the woods, my grandmother knew all the secrets, unlatching concealed compartments in our heirloom secretary’s desk. Then she would open a hinged box full of Russian bonds issued by the czar before the revolution, one of the ways we had lost our family money.As in any popular fairy tale, our château symbolized romance. It was a wedding gift for my great-grandmother, and as a teen, I roamed into the ivy, walking carefully around holly, until I found what I called Sleeping Beauty’s Alley. Often, I went to this natural arcade made of overarching trees with a soft ivy carpet on the ground and green light streaming in.Grandma Nicole was playful but private. Though my grandparents were devout Catholics, as a teen I finally did the math — my father’s birth was less than nine months after the wedding. When I asked them, my grandfather said, “The Church has always understood the sins of the flesh.” I joked that everyone was amazed at her premature baby’s plump cheeks. I imagined her as an 18-year-old, forced into marriage after she got pregnant, dreaming of an independent life. Later my great-aunt told me about the party when my future grandparents had slept together. They had been pressured to marry by their proper bourgeois families.A complicated love had developed between my playful grandma and my serious grandfather. She had stayed in the marriage, after all. I was the first of the 40-some grandchildren. We each experienced my grandmother’s kindness, restless energy and occasional sharpness. After each shouting fit, she would take to her bed. Of course, the queen could also be a witch.Like Grandma Nicole, La Garenne was sometimes easy to experience, like in summertime, when the breeze rose late in the day. At other times, I trudged through the woods in a downpour, slipping every other step.My life was shaped by peace. My grandmother’s youth took place during World War II. She had never looked a German soldier in the eye during the occupation. She had jumped into roadside ditches with her bicycle to evade German patrols after curfew.Like her woods, my grandmother deserved attentive respect. I was an adult before my great-aunt Alix told me Nicole would dance on the dining room table. Who had she been then, so joyful and unfettered?

",25-10-2021,Why We Can't Stop Obsessing About Our Hair,"Think back to any moment in your life, whether last month or decades ago. If you’re a woman, you probably know just how you were wearing your hair: whether it was long or short, light or dark, curly or straight, up or down. Many of us could organize a memoir through our hairstyles over the years and the effort (or not) it took to maintain them.This isn’t because we’re superficial but because, like it or not, our hair is part of our identity. Unlike other aspects of our identity, however, such as our height, weight, intelligence, and avocation, we can change our hairstyles quickly, effecting an instant transformation with a pair of scissors, a curling iron or a henna rinse. Or all three!When a woman in the movies goes on the lam, she usually applies a bottle of dye at the sink of a rest-stop bathroom, and—presto!—new person. So, while our hair is part of our identity, it’s a temporary part. We think about our hair a lot because we can always change it. And our continuing wish to be physically attractive (in every era and at every age!) means we dwell upon our hair. Even when it isn’t top of mind, one look in the mirror and — there it is — top of head!And when it comes to hair, we usually feel others have it better. The grass is always greener, or shinier, next door. In high school, girls with straight hair would admire my waves, while I wanted a sheet of hair to fall down my back like theirs. In college, I watched in bewilderment as Maura with the long straight hair tried to give body to her limp bangs. Limp bangs were what I craved.In 1969, I went to the Woodstock festival with burn marks on my arm from the iron. Yes, I actually laid my head down on the ironing board, with the iron on the “wool” setting! In the years that followed, there were occasional attempts at chemical straightening. There were bouts with the blow dryer, and touch-ups with the straightening iron. Everything worked … temporarily, and only when the air was dry. I once asked my husband, “How do you like my hair best? Curly or straight?” The question was fraught. If he said “straight,” he’d be disparaging my natural look; if he said “curly,” he’d be dismissing the hours I took making it straight! He paused. Then with diplomatic genius (send him to the Middle East!), he said, “I like that you can wear it both ways.”About a dozen years ago, keratin became widely available; my stylist calls it “the most important beauty product of the last 20 years.” It was the answer to my dreams. Every four or five months I would get a two-hour treatment at the salon, after which I did not style my hair at all: my hair would always be soft and straight. I cut my hair short, and a friend said, “You should have been wearing your hair like thatall your life.”I stopped thinking much about my hair. Then came COVID-19, and the keratin grew out. And I began to appreciate my waves.My 4-year-old granddaughter, who has a bend to her hair, told me solemnly, “I’ve always wanted straight hair.” The “always” killed me. So did the sentiment. I try to be curl-positive around her, scrunching my hair when wet, explaining, “so it will dry curly.” She takes it all in. And popular culture may be helping her accept her hair.Although curls have been said to be making a comeback at least once a decade since 1970, today curls do seem to reign. Never have I seen so many models and actresses with curly or wavy hair! Dead-straight hair (as in Rosamund Pike’s hairdo inI Care a Lot) is starting to look just … dead. After a mere 60 years or so, curls have finally recaptured the crown.Beyond being a personal source of frustration or (rarely) satisfaction, hair has sometimes signaled a person’s political or cultural views. During the English Civil War, Puritans wore their hair closely cropped and were derisively called “Roundheads.”This was in contrast to the royalist Cavaliers, who wore their hair in ringlets past their shoulders. During the 1960s, when college boys came home with long hair, their parents knew it signaled hippie beliefs and occasionally held down their sons to cut their hair.Today, one’s hair does not express one’s politics nor signify one’s profession. Sixty years ago, only “Beatnik chicks” wore their hair long and loose and to the waist. Today, the woman with that hair might be a corporate executive. The guy in a man bun might be a tax attorney.But hair can still bond us to each other. In the ’90s, in the Black community, women with unprocessed hair recognized each other with a smile and a nod. Going natural signaled authenticity. Now there are many ways to signal Black pride, from weaves to locks to buzz cuts to cornrows. This January, in a significant readjustment of its policy, the Army issued a new set of guidelines, allowing Black female soldiers much greater flexibility in how they wear their hair.Other people who have bonded through their hair are the “silver foxes”: attractive women who have let their hair go gray or white naturally. My friend Kathy started to go white at age 40; today, her shining, chin-length bob is not only convenient to maintain but signals an assurance, the confidence that she doesn’t need artifice to look good. When I walk in New York with her, I see other women with white hair and good clothes giving my friend “the look”: one of approval, commonality, sisterhood.I can’t join that sisterhood because I’m married to a much younger man and mustn’t be mistaken for his mother! But my cousin Jackie has joined the sorority. I recently saw her in person for the first time in a year. She’d stopped coloring her hair during the pandemic; her black hair now contains thick bands of silver. “It’s gorgeous,” I told her, sincerely.

",8/11/2021,A Divorcée’s Guide to Navigating the Holidays,"As the holidays approach, those of us who are divorced often brace for an emotional onslaught, especially when children are involved. Holidays are still challenging for me since my divorce. Our young adult children live in different cities but come to our hometown for Thanksgiving and Christmas. They attempt to split their time between our households, but adjustments and accommodations are not easy.Holidays are often laden with expectations, many of which were formed during our own childhoods. Divorce throws a monkey wrench into things. For me, having expectations breeds resentment. So I try to minimize them.According to 2019 census figures, 7.6 out of every 1,000 marriages in the U.S. ends in divorce.The majority ofthose divorces occur in families with children under the age of 18.For the welfare of their children, it is important that former spouses try to establish conflict-free parenting relationships to minimize any difficulties. Children should not be made to suffer for their parents’ decisions.Port-divorce co-parenting relationships run a wide gamut. Some couples do it seamlessly. Jacqueline “Jack” Perez, 57, of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and her ex-husband began by dividing up the holidays evenly. Once their son was old enough to voice his opinion, they tried to accommodate his wishes. “I have to say that I feel incredibly grateful that both my ex and I put the security and stability of our child’s life over ours,” Perez says. “We may not have been happy about missing out on a particular holiday, but we never griped about it to our son. Grownups need to be grown-up.”For others, however, anger seeps into their interactions and planning. I have very little contact with my ex-husband. We communicate by text, and only when necessary. I hope we can be friends in the future and possibly even spend time together with our children.My parents divorced when I was 6. When I was young, I was thrilled with my split household, thrilled to celebrate two Christmases, with multiple gifts at both houses. As I got older, I did not look forward to it as much. My ex, who has much more money than I do, often takes my children and their partners on an expensive post-Christmas trip, which rankles me. I have learned to be grateful that my kids get these opportunities and to recognize that there is enough love to go around. But it was not easy.I have checked in with some wise divorced women, who have children of various ages, for tips on the best way to handle the challenging holiday season. Clear communication is paramount, they say.“In the beginning, it was so stressful,” says Sue Sudbay, 59, of Palm Springs, California. “I think the key is really proactive and early communication between the two of you, and not via the kids. For example, send an email or give a call and say, ‘I’m planning on having the kids this year for Thanksgiving. How about they come to your place for dessert?’ The other thing that worked for us is when they didn’t come to my house, we’d have another Thanksgiving dinner on the Saturday or Sunday after. We’d sit around and watch football and just enjoy a nice day together. It felt just as good as the actual holiday, without the kids having to bounce back and forth.”Cecily Banks, 57, of Warren, Rhode Island, and her ex-husband made the decision together early in their separation to come together as a unit at important family and holiday events. “We told our two children that our marital situation was a painful loss, but not determinative of everything about who we are and will continue to be as a family,” says Banks “We told them that we will always be a loving, supportive unit. As my ex-husband and I moved into long-term relationships with significant others, we brought our partners into the fold and now celebrate most family and holiday occasions with them. That is not to say we don’t feel the deep loss of a marriage and a single-family unit, but we don’t feel the loss of these loving and joyful moments.”Denver, Colorado, resident, Erin Glover, 60, advises flexibility and not taking anything personally. She is considerate of her children when they leave to go to her ex-spouse’s home. “Remember, they are creating memories from both experiences, and you don’t want to make your children feel guilty for sharing time with your ex-husband,” advises Glover. “It’s all about being respectful of your children’s feelings. I coordinate times for holiday meals with my ex-husband, and try not to make my sons eat too much at my house, recognizing they have to visit their father. Above all else, always do things that bring your children closer to you rather than pushing them away with guilt or bad-mouthing their father. It also goes a long way to text or email your ex-husband on Father’s Day, saying thank you for fathering our beautiful children.”As I have found in navigating the holidays after divorce, you can succeed in making new traditions for yourself and for your children.But you must recognize what you can and cannot control. My ex hosts the children for a Thanksgiving brunch and I get them for Thanksgiving dinner. My ex gets the kids for Christmas Eve and I get them for Christmas Day. Now that my adult children have serious partners, I have to share their holiday time with those parents as well.Since so many people compete for time with my beloved children, I focus on the quality of the time we have together instead of the quantity. Be present and celebrate — while you have your children under your roof.","As the holidays approach, those of us who are divorced often brace for an emotional onslaught, especially when children are involved.

",8/11/2021,Do Mothers Over 100 Still Give Advice? Of Course!,"Vivien Yellin, aka my mom, was a champion advice giver. Maybe too much of a champion. But ever since she died, at 92, I’ve missed all that loving input — from “Never be financially dependent on a man” to “Always serve salmon patties with applesauce.”When my college roommate Stacy wasn’t sure what to wear to her 70th-birthday party, she knew that her mom, Shirley Dean, 102, would advise her. Or, as Stacy says, “Tell me what to do.”Get some sleep; pull your hair back; wear the striped dress.As of 2020, there are 90,000 centenarians in the United States — up from 50,000 at the beginning of the century — and 80 percent of them are women. Which must mean that a lot of “children” in their 70s and 80s are still getting maternal advice.“Do you ever stop feeling like a mom?” Stacy asked her mom.“No,” Shirley said. “A mother always feels like a mother.”My friend JoAnn was marrying for the first time at age 65. Her mom, Pearl Hirsh Tansman, had waited a long time to see JoAnn walk down that aisle. When her fiancé, Robert, encouraged moving the wedding up to January from the summer — “After all, your mother is100…” — JoAnn worried about the weather.“You’ll see,” Pearl told her, “the weather will be beautiful!”Pearl was right. Jan. 11, 2020, was sunny and 65 degrees in New York. Pearl sat in a front-row seat, wearing a sparkly cardigan and big corsage. The last advice she gave JoAnn was right after the ceremony, when she said, “Stack your rings.”Six days later, Pearl died in her sleep.“My mother was razor-sharp until her last day on earth,” JoAnn says. “Our biggest pleasures were the simplest ones — girlie lunches or just doing our nails together. She often said, ‘Here I am 100 and I feel like I'm 75!’ She did not believe in the wordretirement, and said ‘Retirement means retiring from life.’ I hold that advice dearly.”Brent Barrett, who starred on Broadway inPhantom of the OperaandChicago,grew up in Quinter, Kansas (population 800). Brent’s mother, Edith, baked pies for the only café in town. “She was a fantastic baker,” Brent says. Her specialty: gooseberry pie.Edith broke her hip washing her car in the middle of a cold December. She was tossing out a bucket of water and slipped on ice. She was 98 at the time. At 101, she moved to an assisted living residence in Hays, Kansas (population 14,000). At 102, to a standing ovation, she walked Brent down his wedding aisle. When the question was asked, “Who gives this man to be married?” Edith, who didn’t hear well, remained silent. So Brent turned and mouthed to her, “Now!” Edith smiled and called out, “I do!”During the rise of COVID-19, Edith moved to Las Vegas to live with the couple. Now 104, Edith broke her other hip last November and is in a wheelchair.“She’s never been one to question,” Brent says. “She takes whatever is dealt to her and moves forward. The only real advice she ever gives me is, ‘Just don’t expect much — then you won’t be too disappointed.’ ”Another quality he points to as the ticket for her longevity: “Kansas prairie living.”When I was in seventh grade, my best friend’s mother, Lea Beletz, was the fun, glamorous mom, with her bouffant hairdos, tight skirts and (always) high heels. Lea was 72 when Marcia’s dad passed away 35 years ago. Yes. Do the math. Lea is 107 and lives alone in her own apartment, with no aides, and because over the years her hamstrings have tightened so much, she canonlywear high heels.“Her doctors have a little heart attack every time they see her walking in her heels and wobbles a bit,” Marcia says. “But she tells them, ‘Oh, no worries, I’m just dancing a little!’ ”Lea stopped driving at 100 because of poor eyesight. “She was sad about that for ages,” Marcia says. “And she ran over one too many toes and terrorized too many people with the motorized shopping cart at Costco, so they took away the keys. She’ll tell me it’s not fun being this old, but the minute I think she’s down for the count, she’s back! Feisty and motivated.”Lea still gives Marcia cooking tips and shares her daily political thoughts. “Don’t even mention a medical issue,” Marcia says. “Because she’ll drive you crazy trying to fix it with her limited Google search abilities.”So, what’s the best part about having a mom who is over 100? Marcia responds quickly: “It’s hearing her voice first thing in the morning, calling to say, ‘I’m still alive.’ ”The other day I was debating what to serve at a baby shower, and my first instinct was to reach for the phone.Mom will know.My mother would be close to 100 now. Oh, how I wish I could call her and ask for advice.","Vivien Yellin, aka my mom, was a champion advice giver. Maybe too much of a champion. But ever since she died, at 92, I’ve missed all that loving input — from “Never be financially dependent on a man” to “Always serve salmon patties with applesauce.”When my college roommate Stacy wasn’t sure what to wear to her 70th-birthday party, she knew that her mom, Shirley Dean, 102, would advise her. Or, as Stacy says, “Tell me what to do.”Get some sleep; pull your hair back; wear the striped dress.As of 2020, there are 90,000 centenarians in the United States — up from 50,000 at the beginning of the century — and 80 percent of them are women. Which must mean that a lot of “children” in their 70s and 80s are still getting maternal advice.“Do you ever stop feeling like a mom?” Stacy asked her mom.“No,” Shirley said. “A mother always feels like a mother.”My friend JoAnn was marrying for the first time at age 65. Her mom, Pearl Hirsh Tansman, had waited a long time to see JoAnn walk down that aisle. When her fiancé, Robert, encouraged moving the wedding up to January from the summer — “After all, your mother is100…” — JoAnn worried about the weather.“You’ll see,” Pearl told her, “the weather will be beautiful!”Pearl was right. Jan. 11, 2020, was sunny and 65 degrees in New York. Pearl sat in a front-row seat, wearing a sparkly cardigan and big corsage. The last advice she gave JoAnn was right after the ceremony, when she said, “Stack your rings.”Six days later, Pearl died in her sleep.“My mother was razor-sharp until her last day on earth,” JoAnn says. “Our biggest pleasures were the simplest ones — girlie lunches or just doing our nails together. She often said, ‘Here I am 100 and I feel like I'm 75!’ She did not believe in the wordretirement, and said ‘Retirement means retiring from life.’ I hold that advice dearly.”Brent Barrett, who starred on Broadway inPhantom of the OperaandChicago,grew up in Quinter, Kansas (population 800). Brent’s mother, Edith, baked pies for the only café in town. “She was a fantastic baker,” Brent says. Her specialty: gooseberry pie.Edith broke her hip washing her car in the middle of a cold December. She was tossing out a bucket of water and slipped on ice. She was 98 at the time. At 101, she moved to an assisted living residence in Hays, Kansas (population 14,000). At 102, to a standing ovation, she walked Brent down his wedding aisle. When the question was asked, “Who gives this man to be married?” Edith, who didn’t hear well, remained silent. So Brent turned and mouthed to her, “Now!” Edith smiled and called out, “I do!”During the rise of COVID-19, Edith moved to Las Vegas to live with the couple. Now 104, Edith broke her other hip last November and is in a wheelchair.“She’s never been one to question,” Brent says. “She takes whatever is dealt to her and moves forward. The only real advice she ever gives me is, ‘Just don’t expect much — then you won’t be too disappointed.’ ”Another quality he points to as the ticket for her longevity: “Kansas prairie living.”When I was in seventh grade, my best friend’s mother, Lea Beletz, was the fun, glamorous mom, with her bouffant hairdos, tight skirts and (always) high heels. Lea was 72 when Marcia’s dad passed away 35 years ago. Yes. Do the math. Lea is 107 and lives alone in her own apartment, with no aides, and because over the years her hamstrings have tightened so much, she canonlywear high heels.“Her doctors have a little heart attack every time they see her walking in her heels and wobbles a bit,” Marcia says. “But she tells them, ‘Oh, no worries, I’m just dancing a little!’ ”Lea stopped driving at 100 because of poor eyesight. “She was sad about that for ages,” Marcia says. “And she ran over one too many toes and terrorized too many people with the motorized shopping cart at Costco, so they took away the keys. She’ll tell me it’s not fun being this old, but the minute I think she’s down for the count, she’s back! Feisty and motivated.”Lea still gives Marcia cooking tips and shares her daily political thoughts. “Don’t even mention a medical issue,” Marcia says. “Because she’ll drive you crazy trying to fix it with her limited Google search abilities.”So, what’s the best part about having a mom who is over 100? Marcia responds quickly: “It’s hearing her voice first thing in the morning, calling to say, ‘I’m still alive.’ ”The other day I was debating what to serve at a baby shower, and my first instinct was to reach for the phone.Mom will know.My mother would be close to 100 now. Oh, how I wish I could call her and ask for advice."

",15-11-2021,Celebrity Upkeep: The Top Beauty Secrets of the Stars  ,"The gorgeous Carmen Dell’Orefice, who’s still modeling at 90, compares going under the knife to having a tune-up. “I mean, if you had a ceiling fan falling down in your living room, would you not get it replaced?” she asks sensibly in the HBO documentaryAbout Face.I was an early adopter of Botox and I’ve written a novel calledThe Botox Diarieswhich tells you something about where I stand on keeping up my looks. Though surgery, hmm. I’m on Google so often, checking to see how celebrities who haven’t had face-lifts are holding up, that if at this very minute the police were to impound my computer, they’d conclude I’m a stalker. (Diane Keaton, Lauren Hutton and Diane von Furstenberg: I swear I’m not dangerous.)Still, how do the stars — whose looks can be their calling cards — deal with getting older? Here are some of their tips, culled from my own reporting as a long-time reporter on the celebrity beauty beat.Celebrity dermatologist Dendy Engelman, M.D., laughs as she recounts a favorite quote from superstar patient Sophia Vergara. “Sophia says, ‘If you told me to eat Crazy Glue I’d do it,’ ” Engelman says. “But, in fact, Sophia’s beauty comes from within, she’s a great human being. And she never looks overdone.” Vergara, who was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in her 20s, believes it’s important to take care of your body. She’s never smoked and, although as a Columbian she loves the sun, she never goes outside without sunscreen. (She uses bronzer to get a natural-looking glow.) The 49-year-oldModern Familystar is “committed to health and wellness,’ Engelman says. And she also indulges in a few favorite beauty treatments.Vergara enjoys regular LED/Oxylight facials, a 60- to 90-minute noninvasive treatment that combines micro currents, oxygen and LED lights to tone and tighten skin and give it a temporary glow. The actress also employs EM-SCULPT treatments, which use magnetic fields, similar to those in an MRI machine, to build and define muscle tone. In Vergara’s case, it also helped heal a knee injury more quickly.Vergara has also recently discovered the benefits of an Infrared Sauna blanket. Lying underneath the blanket, the body is engulfed with sauna-like heat, said to detox the body. Someone I know compared it to “climbing into a Hot Pocket,” but according to Engelman, the results are worth it. “It reduces muscle aches and increases white blood cell production to boost immunity,” she says. “Which is important, because as we age, our immunity wanes.”Just like the rest of us, when Madonna sleeps face down, she wakes up with puffy eyes. But unlike us, instead of reaching for a run-of-the-mill cold cream or slice of cucumber, the 62-year-old Queen of Pop dabs on her very own MDNA skin care line, which includes a $600 chrome clay mask that comes with a “magic wand” to remove the clay along with impurities. “Madonna’s very disciplined, “says her dermatologist and MDNA cocreator.Paul Jarrod Frank, M.D. “She eats healthy, she doesn’t drink, smoke, doesn’t go out in the sun, she gets a good night’s sleep and she comes into the office frequently for treatments.”And then there’s her rumored plastic surgery. As a performer, Madonna spends a lot of time wearing heavy makeup and sweating under hot lights, which is extra taxing on her skin. So when she’s on tour, her entourage includes an aesthetician who gives her daily facials. She also swears by the same Oxylight facials that Sophia Vergara and other red-carpet celebrities love — but Madonna being Madonna, while others go into their derm’s offices for treatments, Madonna bought her own Oxylight machine to use at home.I first met Ali McGraw at the height of herLove Storyfame, and yes, she was conventionally gorgeous. When I interviewed her 20-odd years later, she was coming to terms with no longer being the “it” girl.“There’s such a staggering emphasis placed on looks as a measure of whether you’re still worth counting in the human race,” she said.Still McGraw decided to “age gracefully.” After her Los Angeles house burned down, she moved to Santa Fe where she said, “I meet traffic-stopping-ly beautiful women in their 80s. What they have in common is curiosity, knowing what matters.”After her move, the 50-something McGraw produced the videoAli McGraw Yoga Mind and Body, which became a best seller. On her 75th birthday, McGraw let her dark locks go silvery grey, and because she remains a fashion icon, the news went viral.Today, at 82, McGraw has found a serenity that she wasn’t accorded in Hollywood. “I’ll never look 18 again,” she said. “I’ve arrived at a point in my life where, if there are bags under my eyes, I don’t want to be around people who are going to tell me I look lousy. I want someone to say, ‘You look tired. Is there something I can do to help?’ ”And then, just as I was finishing this article, came the news that 58-year-old fashion designer Marc Jacobs was posting pictures on Instagram of his facelift. Jacobs, who’s talked about having Botox, thread lifts and a hair transplant, was equally transparent about going under the knife. “No shame in being vain,” he captioned pictures of his very swollen face wrapped in bandages. Definitely no shame. But what about the pain? While I admire Jacobs’ honesty seeing those pictures gave me the willies — and I think I’ve finally come to a decision. Sophia, Ali, Dr. Engelman, thank you for leading the way.

",10/5/2021,7 Stellar Beauty Products for Women 50 and Beyond,"As any handyman will tell you, having the right tools for the job makes all the difference. Cooks say the same thing about their utensils. And, although we women over 50, 60 and 70 may hesitate to admit it, the same is true of our beauty kits. The makeup and hair products we latched onto two or three decades ago may not satisfy our current needs — or wants. We have changed …  and so must our beauty tools.I’ve compiled a list of seven items for your updated beauty kit. Use these suggestions to create a personalized swag bag to gift yourself for any special occasion and to lift your best spirits going forward.1. If it’sall about the eyesthis pandemic season, you definitely need the right mascara to turn fading lashes into a lush frame for your smiling eyes. Too Faced’s Better Than Sex Volumizing Mascara delivers dramatic volume and length. At $26, it may be a little pricey for everyone but, hey, the name itself gives it cachet.Casie Lucas, an award-winning makeup artist with 20-plus years of experience working in the fashion, entertainment and film industries, recommends Benefit’s They’re Real! Lengthening & Volumizing Mascara ($13 to $26). Its ability to plump up and lengthen — along with a rich, jet black color — creates the appearance of false lashes. For hooded eyes, the water-resistant formula keeps the mascara from smudging or transferring onto eyelids.Less expensive options that yield impressive results are Essence’s Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara ($5) and my longtime standby — L’Oréal’s Voluminous Original Mascara ($9). Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 2. The jogger, gardener or Zumba class star canwork the knotsout while soaking in a tub liberally sprinkled with fragrant CBD Formula Bath Salts by Lord Jones. Scented with evergreen and citrus, the mix of pink Himalayan and Epsom salts soothingly erases any stress with fewer calories than a glass of wine. It’s a rejuvenating way to celebrate some me time on self-care Sundays — or any other day of the week.In this relaxed state of perfect calm after my own soak, I promise it’s worth the $65 price tag; you are worth it.For a less expensive option, check out Herbivore’s Natural Soaking Bath Salts (Calm) for $18. Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 3.Gray hair,whether it'sau naturelor dyed, tends to be coarse and wiry. Smooth the kinks out with TiGi Bed Head’s magical hair balm called After Party Smoothing Cream ($8 to $18). All it takes is a pea-size amount on dry hair to tame fly-aways, static electricity and any frizz that pops up at your tropical vacation or on any damp city street. Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 4. But then there’s the opposite challenge —thin hair that gets flatteras the day goes by. Experts like Lucas know that using dry shampoo can add volume and texture without the stickiness of hair spray. Sectioning dry hair and spraying shampoo on the underside from root to mid-length in a zigzag pattern can add elusive body.Although there are more expensive options out there (such as Wella’s Eimi Dry Me Dry Shampoo at $19.50), the one Lucas prefers is Batiste Original Dry Shampoo Clean & Classic Original ($6.50). Backstage at fashion shows, she says, this is all you’ll see. Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 5. To keeprandom hairsfrom sprouting in all the wrong places, consider LED-lighted tweezers that help you home in on the target and quickly eliminate any invaders. After researching online and reading dozens of reviews, I opted for the Revlon Gold Series Lighted Slant Tweezer ($12.50).Their textured grip and bright light make easy work of plucking dark and white hairs alike. But be forewarned, short battery life is a common complaint for this type of product. That’s why the price and functionality of the Revlon tweezers hit the sweet spot — and they’re available at drugstore chains and online sellers.There are also Coco’s Closet Tweezers for Eyebrows for $9.95. Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 6. Over time, more and more things on ourfacesseem to need covering up. A broken capillary, age spots, dark circles under the eyes. They’re not going away on their own, but the right concealer can make them disappear for the day — or night. A personal favorite I found after a longstanding gem folded during the pandemic is Laura Mercier’s Flawless Fusion Ultra-Longwear Concealer ($29). The crease-resistant formula flexes with the skin and provides 12-hour coverage.Lucas is a fan of It Cosmetics’ Bye Bye Under Eye Anti-Aging Concealer ($12.50 to $28), because it doesn’t settle into fine lines or wrinkles as the hours tick by. Apply it anywhere on your face for a dewy, radiant finish that’s well-suited to mature skin. Anisha Sisodia (Prop Stylist: Nasim Lahbichi) 7. Finally, at night, doing this one thing is the surest path to ablemish-free complexion.Drier, mature skin requires special care that bar soaps and makeup-remover wipes can’t deliver. Too often they upset the skin’s natural pH balance, causing flakiness or oiliness. Instead, Lucas recommends two emollient-rich cleansers that are gentle enough to be used even around the eyes. On the costlier side is Lancôme’s Lait Galatée Confort cleansing milk ($31 to $54), which can be found at department store cosmetic counters.A less-pricey option is SheaMoisture’s 100% Virgin Coconut Oil Daily Hydration Face Milk Cleanser ($11), available at big-box retailers and national drugstore chains. Both cleansers are mild enough for mature skin, but they still remove the remnants of a day well lived.

",10/1/2022,Do Social Invitations Dwindle When You’re No Longer a Couple? ,"My first-marriage in-laws were bridge players. They spoke of people in pairs: Ed and Marge; Dave and Gwen. Their entire social life revolved around their couples’ friends. The 22-year-old me asked my mother-in-law what happened when someone was widowed and no longer had a bridge partner. Her answer—ever so blasé and with the flap of a hand—was, “Oh, the women never really fit in after that.”Yikes! Did my mother-in-law dump her widowed friends? In a world of cosmic justice, she would have been widowed herself and cut out of bridge games; instead, she lived to 98, dying two years before my father-in-law, who made it to 100.When husband No. 2, Randy, and I first became a couple,I began getting dinner-party invitations for the first time in years. I’d thought dinner parties had gone out of style, that nobody was doing that sort of entertaining anymore. Then I realized that, no, they just weren’t invitingme,uncoupled divorcée Linda. I had stopped fitting in.Randy and I have been together for over 25 years now. Without planning it this way, our social life is usually one of twosomes. We’re at the stage where unless we both get hit by a bus at the same time, one of us will outlive the other, with the odds in my favor. By age 85 and older, 70 percent of women are widowed—twice the number of widowed men at 85. I hate to admit how often I think about this. To reassure myself that things have improved, that uncoupling no longer means unfriending, I spoke with some of my favorite women, all of whom, in one way or another, are experts on the subject.“I miss the couples who haven’t stayed in touch,” said Wilma Classen, 85, a lyricist and former therapist who’s been widowed three years. “People project onto you like you’ll be too needy and vulnerable, when you’re fine!”“It never happens with the men,” added Bente Hirsch, 82, who was running a TV-commercial production company when she was widowed at age 47. “They can be a thousand years old, completely needy, and as long as they have a pulse, they get invited everywhere.”Married for over 40 years, Le Lieu Browne, 87, and her husband lived out of suitcases around the globe while he worked as a foreign correspondent and she as a photojournalist forThe New York Times. She misses the lively political discussions with all the associates who became friends but haven’t stayed in touch. And she isn’t comfortable contacting them. “They’re married,” she said. “I don’t want them thinking I want anything romantic.”So far, this wasn’t too encouraging.“People don’t like odd numbers,” said Debi Feinman, 65, who has spent most of her life single.In the past three years, Jackie Taub’s husband has slipped into dementia. “We used to go out with friends several nights a week,” she said. “But now the nights are quiet—too quiet. Maybe it helps that the single men insist on paying their own way. Men are always feeling like they have to pay for the women, but then it becomes a thingand you aren’t included. My first widowed friend figured that out fast and won’t let anyone pick up her check.”That night I asked Randy if he feels obligated to pick up checks for single women.“No,” he said, “I like picking up checks for single women.” Which explains why he was dating half of New York when I first met him.Le Lieu signed up for painting classes, where she’s made friends. Feinman is the queen of discovering fun activities—art fairs, food festivals, walking tours—and recruiting everyone. Classen decided to move to an independent living community closer to her son and daughter-in-law. She sees it as an opportunity to make friends in a place where everyone is new and looking for buddies.“Younger friends keep you on your toes,” Bente said, adding, “and, hopefully, won’t die on you.” I laughed—right after I grimaced. I am Bente’s younger friend.Unofficial survey complete, I regret to say that progress has been slow. I’m making double certain that I’m including my single friends in social outings. A change in partner status can affect friendships. But I’m prepared. I have a game plan: Don’t wait for invitations. Host dinners for all those insensitive couples. Pay your own restaurant check. Enroll in classes to meet new people. Build a social life around other single women, knowing that the pool of potential friends is growing daily.Twenty years ago, my Aunt Dorothy, now 97, moved into a senior community in Florida after my uncle died. She wanted to play mah-jongg , but there were no openings at any of the games. The community clubhouse was charging for lessons, so Aunt Dorothy posted a notice on the bulletin board,FREE Mah-jongg Lessons. Aunt Dorothy made friends fast. She’s my future role model. And in the meantime, I’ll make sure Randy looks both ways before stepping into traffic.","My first-marriage in-laws were bridge players. They spoke of people in pairs: Ed and Marge; Dave and Gwen. Their entire social life revolved around their couples’ friends. The 22-year-old me asked my mother-in-law what happened when someone was widowed and no longer had a bridge partner. Her answer—ever so blasé and with the flap of a hand—was, “Oh, the women never really fit in after that.”Yikes! Did my mother-in-law dump her widowed friends? In a world of cosmic justice, she would have been widowed herself and cut out of bridge games; instead, she lived to 98, dying two years before my father-in-law, who made it to 100.When husband No. 2, Randy, and I first became a couple,I began getting dinner-party invitations for the first time in years. I’d thought dinner parties had gone out of style, that nobody was doing that sort of entertaining anymore. Then I realized that, no, they just weren’t invitingme,uncoupled divorcée Linda. I had stopped fitting in.Randy and I have been together for over 25 years now. Without planning it this way, our social life is usually one of twosomes. We’re at the stage where unless we both get hit by a bus at the same time, one of us will outlive the other, with the odds in my favor. By age 85 and older, 70 percent of women are widowed—twice the number of widowed men at 85. I hate to admit how often I think about this. To reassure myself that things have improved, that uncoupling no longer means unfriending, I spoke with some of my favorite women, all of whom, in one way or another, are experts on the subject.“I miss the couples who haven’t stayed in touch,” said Wilma Classen, 85, a lyricist and former therapist who’s been widowed three years. “People project onto you like you’ll be too needy and vulnerable, when you’re fine!”“It never happens with the men,” added Bente Hirsch, 82, who was running a TV-commercial production company when she was widowed at age 47. “They can be a thousand years old, completely needy, and as long as they have a pulse, they get invited everywhere.”Married for over 40 years, Le Lieu Browne, 87, and her husband lived out of suitcases around the globe while he worked as a foreign correspondent and she as a photojournalist forThe New York Times. She misses the lively political discussions with all the associates who became friends but haven’t stayed in touch. And she isn’t comfortable contacting them. “They’re married,” she said. “I don’t want them thinking I want anything romantic.”So far, this wasn’t too encouraging.“People don’t like odd numbers,” said Debi Feinman, 65, who has spent most of her life single.In the past three years, Jackie Taub’s husband has slipped into dementia. “We used to go out with friends several nights a week,” she said. “But now the nights are quiet—too quiet. Maybe it helps that the single men insist on paying their own way. Men are always feeling like they have to pay for the women, but then it becomes a thingand you aren’t included. My first widowed friend figured that out fast and won’t let anyone pick up her check.”That night I asked Randy if he feels obligated to pick up checks for single women.“No,” he said, “I like picking up checks for single women.” Which explains why he was dating half of New York when I first met him.Le Lieu signed up for painting classes, where she’s made friends. Feinman is the queen of discovering fun activities—art fairs, food festivals, walking tours—and recruiting everyone. Classen decided to move to an independent living community closer to her son and daughter-in-law. She sees it as an opportunity to make friends in a place where everyone is new and looking for buddies.“Younger friends keep you on your toes,” Bente said, adding, “and, hopefully, won’t die on you.” I laughed—right after I grimaced. I am Bente’s younger friend.Unofficial survey complete, I regret to say that progress has been slow. I’m making double certain that I’m including my single friends in social outings. A change in partner status can affect friendships. But I’m prepared. I have a game plan: Don’t wait for invitations. Host dinners for all those insensitive couples. Pay your own restaurant check. Enroll in classes to meet new people. Build a social life around other single women, knowing that the pool of potential friends is growing daily.Twenty years ago, my Aunt Dorothy, now 97, moved into a senior community in Florida after my uncle died.

",14-02-2022,Mothering (Not Smothering) Adult Children,"After birthing, nursing, soothing, protecting and cheering every milestone, how do you let go when your kids reach adulthood? My epiphany arrived via an avocado, as I tried to encourage my 27-year-old daughter to take one perfectly ripe one from our home to her apartment, even though I knew her fridge was bursting with groceries.Other than signing in to our Netflix account, she was financially independent. She could buy a case of avocados, but I still needed togiveher things. Was it a symbol of my enduring love for her? I didn’t want to—and couldn’t—stop mothering her.The next week she sent me a TikTok, and I felt cool that she didn’t dismiss me as too clueless to enjoy the latest social media craze. This hilarious video featured comedian Leah Rudick as a satirical mom of an adult daughter before she flies away on a trip.“Here’s some fruit,” she begins, “take thewhole bowl.” Out come leftovers: “We’ll never eat them!” Next a huge tin of coffee, and she even pushes forward the coffeemaker: “We’ll never use it again.” By the time she was foisting 12 bottles of water and a suitcase of canned goods—in case the apocalypse arrived thousands of miles in the air—I wasn’t laughing anymore. “That’s you, Mom,”my daughter texted.I keep wanting to give. Increasingly, she needs not to receive.Transitioning from being a mother of young children to grown ones is a challenge. Legally, our children are adults when they reach their 18th birthday. Yet full brain maturity often doesn’t occur until age 25, according to current research, cited by Sandra Aamodt, neuroscientist and coauthor ofWelcome to Your Child’s Brain.Unlike our grandparents’ generation, our kids become adults much later.For perhaps the first time in history, we’ve raised “boomerang children,” many of whom return home after a period of independence. Millennials living at home soared from 15 percent in 2016 to 52 percent in 2020, according to the Pew Research Center. This may be due to economic necessity, especially prevalent during the first year of the pandemic.Eventually—we hope—they return their keys and go off on their own again. But even if your kids haven’t boomeranged back into your kitchen full-time, emerging adulthood is an in-between developmental stage of personal identity from age 18 to 29. The term was coined by Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, senior research scholar at Clark University in Massachusetts.No wonder it’s so hard to let go!As parents of young children, we are in charge of deciding where our kids will go to school, whom they’ll play with, which summer activities they’ll participate in. By adolescence, they have more power over certain choices, but parents still control much of what they do. In emerging adulthood, there is less that parents can control—other than paying for college, for example. Once our children become financially independent, there is a big shift.“The older they get, the less youdetermine the nature of the relationship and the more theydetermine it,” Arnett told me in an interview. “They will be very intent on deciding for themselves where to live, how they will live and how often they’ll have contact with you. They know what’s no longer in your control, and they like it that way.”This shift of control is the key change in dynamics between parents and children when they reach adulthood—and the most challenging part for parents. Even if you think you have the wisest advice to offer, your kids may not want to listen. Sure, you have experienced more of the complexities and pitfalls of life, and you only want the best for them. But by their mid-20s, adult children are determined to make their own decisions, from education to job choices to romantic partners. And they may conceal certain parts of their lives if they’re afraid we may not approve.“We have to let go of the control, even if we don’t want to, even when we think their decisions are not good ideas,” Arnett advises.Romantic partnerships are the least likely subject that adult children are willing to discuss with parents. “The harder you push, the less they want to hear,” Arnett says. “You don’t have a choice to give up control. You only have a choice on how to respond to it.”It’s tough to pull back after all those years of nurturing your children. An exception is if you think there is anything unhealthy or abusive going on in their lives or relationships. At those critical times, they’re more apt to listen, Arnett says, “if you haven’t previously intruded in things that are none of your business.”Fortunately, many decisions that parents may want to control and that may result in tension—like what kind of car to buy—won’t matter much later on. “You’ll be laughing about them years later because they’re so overblown,” Arnett predicts with a chuckle.I’ve learned to stop trying to send my daughter home with avocados. She knows I love her. I want to show her that I respect her ability to thrive on her own. Recently, we went out for ice cream and started wrestling over who should pay. She pulled out her phone more quickly than I could mine, pushing me aside and clicking “pay” for both of us.She’s not a little kid whom I’m treating to ice cream anymore, even though I’ll always remember her that way. Her small gesture is a huge display of her independence and maturity. I let her control it and admire her for it.

",18-08-2020,Men Over 55 Reveal the Best Sex They Ever Had,"Sex. We do it often. Or sometimes we don’t. We think about it. We (hopefully) remember our first time. We google it. We talk to our most trusted girlfriends or our sisters about it. We watch scenes of others doing it in movies and TV shows. We desire it. We sometimes feel ashamed of it or regret it or fantasize about having more of it. It is one of those things that is always there — even when we are not doing it. And even though I’m nearly 50, I have to be honest, I still have just as many questions as I did when I was 16.I recently had sex with my new, eh … friend-with-benefits shall we call him, and I was left speechless.That was great, I thought. I continued thinking about it for days to come and I couldn’t help but wonder —did he think it was great? If so, just how great was it? Like on a scale of 1 to 10, how would he rate our experience? Was I the best he ever had? If not, who was and why exactly was she so great?The questions lingered in my brain for days, but I just couldn’t bring myself to ask him. I feared that I would come across as jealous or lacking in the confidence department — or a little of both.And so, I decided to venture out and take an easier route to satisfy my curiosity: I asked men (whom I haven’t slept with) to tell me about the best sex they ever had — and what made it so darn good, because inquiring minds want to know. Naturally, I wanted to ask men with years of experience, so I headed to the 55-and-over crowd, and they were eager to share. The responses I received surprised me — and they may surprise you, too.Here is what they had to say.Giving and receiving are equally importantMen love to please a woman just about as much as they enjoy being pleased. Brad, 60, says, “My best sexual experience has lasted for 10 years with my current wife.” Well, hello Mr. Romance, nice to meet you. Isn’t that what we all want to hear from our significant others? He explains how a shift in perspective led to a more fulfilling sex life: “We grew up in an era [where] the woman's job was to satisfy her husband, whether she enjoyed it or not. That is a huge mistake.” Brad made a decision to take action and help change his wife’s perception of sex. He wanted to teach her that sex was not only about pleasing him — he wanted her to know and believe that she deserved to be pleased as well — so he made a commitment to completely end sex after she reached orgasm. For an entire year, he did not have one orgasm during sex. “By shifting my mindset to satisfying her, the experiences lasted longer, she was fully satisfied, and when I took the need to reciprocate away from her, everything changed. It took me a year to help her shift her mindset as she had been taught to satisfy her [partner] first.” That one year was the best thing they ever did for their sex life. In turn, their relationship is thriving, and their improved sex life has only increased his gratitude and admiration for his wife: “The truth of the matter is, I am mesmerized by her beauty. I believe she is more beautiful today than when I met her 20 years ago.”The mind-body connection is importantI think we can all agree on this one — headspace can make or break a sexual experience because mind and body are most definitely connected. When asked if location or position attributed to his best sexual experiences, Pablo, 58, responded “location [and position] weren’t as important as being of a carefree headspace with minimal reminders of daily obligations.”  Jerry, 57, shares a similar sentiment: “For me, when I turned 50, things changed a little. I have never been married and have had my share of girlfriends and experiences. When you are younger, looks and physical things are more important. After 50, I found that my mind was the most important thing in my love life. If my mind is not into it, the rest is not either. Being with someone I enjoy as a person and who challenges me is [always the best sex].” No arguments here, that’s for sure!True love never diesFred, 79, shares that his best sexual experiences live on forever in his memory — and they help to improve the current ones, too. He admits to not remembering the names of many of the women he slept with in his younger years, but adds, “the special times when you were [truly] in love linger on. They are intertwined by the settings in which they took place —  the time her father called upstairs and asked, ‘Are you up, Julie?’ and I couldn't resist saying ‘Yes’; or Rosie and her three Dobermans who interrupted us in bed. [ I get glimpses] of the nights [I had the best sex] on my yacht in the Aegean Sea. Those names I remember, so they have to be meaningful. During sex when getting older, those memories automatically creep back in.” They don’t take away from his current sexual experience at all; they enhance it. “I can be [grateful for] still having sex and for having sufficient memories to keep me going.” Imagine that! Your ex-lovers could be replaying your best moments in bed to this day — I suppose this could be good or bad news, depending on the ex.Medication helpsMark, 68, has been married to his wife for 37 years. “In many ways, our sex life now is as good as it’s ever been. I can say there have been challenges in my sexual performance as I have gotten older, particularly with ED.” Mark has used a variety of medications to assist with his ED and has had to change his medication regimen up a few times before finding the best treatment for him. And now, “the sex with my wife is terrific! In general, what makes for great sex is caring for and about your partner and their needs, and expressing that through intimate, passionate lovemaking.”A confident partnerPablo, 58, says that his top 10 sexual experiences were with women who were confident enough to initiate sex and “uninhibited and comfortable enough to explore [their] assertiveness, which matched my willingness to respond with an uninhibited, nonexpectation-driven desire to please.” We hear it again and again: Confidence is sexy and attractive, so love yourself on the inside and the out, and don’t be afraid to strut your stuff, both in and out of the bedroom, you beautiful thing, you!It's important to have healthy relationships, and tools like AARP's Community Connections can help. Join or renew AARP today to see all that membership has to offer.","Sex. We do it often. Or sometimes we don’t. We think about it. We (hopefully) remember our first time. We google it.

I feared that I would come across as jealous or lacking in the confidence department — or a little of both.And so, I decided to venture out and take an easier route to satisfy my curiosity: I asked men (whom I haven’t slept with) to tell me about the best sex they ever had — and what made it so darn good, because inquiring minds want to know. Naturally, I wanted to ask men with years of experience, so I headed to the 55-and-over crowd, and they were eager to share. The responses I received surprised me — and they may surprise you, too.Here is what they had to say.Giving and receiving are equally importantMen love to please a woman just about as much as they enjoy being pleased. Brad, 60, says, “My best sexual experience has lasted for 10 years with my current wife.” Well, hello Mr. Romance, nice to meet you. Isn’t that what we all want to hear from our significant others? He explains how a shift in perspective led to a more fulfilling sex life: “We grew up in an era [where] the woman's job was to satisfy her husband, whether she enjoyed it or not. That is a huge mistake.” Brad made a decision to take action and help change his wife’s perception of sex. He wanted to teach her that sex was not only about pleasing him — he wanted her to know and believe that she deserved to be pleased as well — so he made a commitment to completely end sex after she reached orgasm. For an entire year, he did not have one orgasm during sex. “By shifting my mindset to satisfying her, the experiences lasted longer, she was fully satisfied, and when I took the need to reciprocate away from her, everything changed. It took me a year to help her shift her mindset as she had been taught to satisfy her [partner] first.” That one year was the best thing they ever did for their sex life. In turn, their relationship is thriving, and their improved sex life has only increased his gratitude and admiration for his wife: “The truth of the matter is, I am mesmerized by her beauty. I believe she is more beautiful today than when I met her 20 years ago.”The mind-body connection is importantI think we can all agree on this one — headspace can make or break a sexual experience because mind and body are most definitely connected. When asked if location or position attributed to his best sexual experiences, Pablo, 58, responded “location [and position] weren’t as important as being of a carefree headspace with minimal reminders of daily obligations.”  Jerry, 57, shares a similar sentiment: “For me, when I turned 50, things changed a little. I have never been married and have had my share of girlfriends and experiences. When you are younger, looks and physical things are more important. After 50, I found that my mind was the most important thing in my love life. If my mind is not into it, the rest is not either. Being with someone I enjoy as a person and who challenges me is [always the best sex].” No arguments here, that’s for sure!True love never diesFred, 79, shares that his best sexual experiences live on forever in his memory — and they help to improve the current ones, too. He admits to not remembering the names of many of the women he slept with in his younger years, but adds, “the special times when you were [truly] in love linger on. They are intertwined by the settings in which they took place —  the time her father called upstairs and asked, ‘Are you up, Julie?’ and I couldn't resist saying ‘Yes’; or Rosie and her three Dobermans who interrupted us in bed. [ I get glimpses] of the nights [I had the best sex] on my yacht in the Aegean Sea. Those names I remember, so they have to be meaningful. During sex when getting older, those memories automatically creep back in.” They don’t take away from his current sexual experience at all; they enhance it. “I can be [grateful for] still having sex and for having sufficient memories to keep me going.” Imagine that! Your ex-lovers could be replaying your best moments in bed to this day — I suppose this could be good or bad news, depending on the ex.Medication helpsMark, 68, has been married to his wife for 37 years. “In many ways, our sex life now is as good as it’s ever been. I can say there have been challenges in my sexual performance as I have gotten older, particularly with ED.” Mark has used a variety of medications to assist with his ED and has had to change his medication regimen up a few times before finding the best treatment for him. And now, “the sex with my wife is terrific! In general, what makes for great sex is caring for and about your partner and their needs, and expressing that through intimate, passionate lovemaking.”A confident partnerPablo, 58, says that his top 10 sexual experiences were with women who were confident enough to initiate sex and “uninhibited and comfortable enough to explore [their] assertiveness, which matched my willingness to respond with an uninhibited, nonexpectation-driven desire to please.” We hear it again and again: Confidence is sexy and attractive, so love yourself on the inside and the out, and don’t be afraid to strut your stuff, both in and out of the bedroom, you beautiful thing, you!It's important to have healthy relationships, and tools like AARP's Community Connections can help.

",4/8/2020,Here’s How You Can Have Hip Gray Hair,"I am technically old enough to have teenage grandchildren who could be going off to college but I don’t, and am not into the traditional grandma look.After nine months in isolation, the first six due to an accident and then mandatory stay-at-home orders, I became very well acquainted with my true hair color. I discovered I had a fabulous silver streak going back from the center of my forehead. My hair had grown well below my shoulders in the 10 months since my last salon visit. The bottom half was brown with bold gold highlights. The top, my natural umber, had enough gray strands to read dark but dingy. A friend I hadn’t seen in months said, “I love your multicolored hair. It’s so cool.” I wondered if this could be a thing. However, I missed the look that had identified me in better times, pre-accident, pre-pandemic.Salons just opened and I made an appointment to visit one in the small town near where I was spending the quarantine. I told the proprietor that I wanted to keep the silver streak. She said that in her country they called the white in front the money piece. Sounded excellent. I was proud to have one. I emerged looking like the old me with blond instead of gray threads in my dark hair plus the streak.However, I, and the world, have changed in the last year, hopefully growing wiser and appreciating what we have. I realized, after altering it, I liked my hair of many colors. Itwasa thing I could embrace. When the gray strands grow out again I will add fewer blond ones, while waiting to become salt and pepper. I hadn’t been ready in the frenzy of getting back to normal to realize we are creating a new normal.Hair is your tell. An indicator of hipness, sometimes age. A big factor is how your gray grows in. Is it thickly silver at the roots all over your head? Do you fight it by dying it a solid color? There’s nothing hip about a brown scalp from years of coloring. Take the leap, let it grow out and see your natural patterns of light and darker. Every woman I know who gave up the old dyed scalp looks much better, more interesting, and not older. If you have naturally light hair, the gray will give you a cool multicolored look, which is much more lively than a one-color job.However, the keys to looking gray and hip are attitude and the cut. Get a good stylist. Gray has many shades that add movement and texture to hair. As an obsessive observer of people, seasoned by decades of riding the subway, my favorites are close-cropped for women with kinky, super curly or wiry hair to pixie cut with a few longer strands framing your face. There’s courage in those looks. Short, buzzed on the nape of the neck, fading into longer on top either falling to a side, slicked back or standing straight up is stunning. Play around with earring options, the more the better. Long silver locks are cool with enough product on them to minimize frizz. The versatility of length lends itself to a ponytail, high single braid or just up with a few locks trailing down. Pull it back into in a slick sophisticated bun balanced by wearing something black or very colorful that accentuates your body’s assets and with earrings you love.For the bold, join my friends who add a dark stripe or two to the gray. Another pal parts her hair on the side, keeping half of it gray and dyes the other half the color she’s been known for most of her adult life.White is the new platinum. Flaunt it, play with it, let it grow. Have it cut in a dramatic style that is perfect for your face. It’s your crowning glory and canvas to accentuate your eyes, with cool frames for glasses and some makeup. Maybe play with adding one streak of pink, red, blue, green or purple. A friend had white hair by the time she was in her 30s. You could always spot her in a crowd, as well as the woman walking across the beach with a short cap of white hair contrasting with her tanned skin. The gray-to-white spectrum is so much hipper than a flat color that has nothing to do with your face or all the things you’ve experienced and become.The Ethel is a great resource for older women.

108,"https://www.aarpethel.com/health/how-i-solved-my-hangover-woes
",4/11/2020,How I Solved My Hangover Woes,"The morning-after brain fog was what I dreaded most. After I indulged in more than one glass of wine, the next day my thoughts were completely muddled. I usually hadn’t slept well, either, waking up around 2:30 a.m. with a pounding headache and then being unable to fall back to sleep for hours.“Our bodies just can’t metabolize the alcohol anymore,” one fifty-something friend said with frustrating resignation when I whined to her. “I limit myself to only one drink now,” she said.Did I really have to break up with wine? Or exert superhuman willpower to cut myself off after merely one glass? That strength would be tough to summon during a pandemic in which that almost nightly elegant glass (or two) was my treasured reward after hours spent at my desk on Zoom calls.Then I remembered something another friend had mentioned at a holiday party last year. “Have you tried clean wines?” asked Kristen Coffield, a self-described “culinary disruptor” and owner of  theCulinary Cure, which advises women on how to eat (and drink) wisely and age well. Her newsletter also touted clean wines as a solution to “wine-overs,” as she calls them.So I did a little reflecting. My worst hangovers came after I consumed an array of random wines at a fundraiser auction, at a wine-tasting evening or during my book-group meetings. Since none of those events would happen anytime soon, however, I had plenty of space and time to research and experiment on my body. Would “clean” wines solve my hangover woes?Serendipitously — or because social media can read my mind — advertisements for cleaner or sustainable wine started appearing in my emails and on my Instagram feed. I ordered half a case of rosé fromThrive Market, a sustainable grocery purveyor that had just launched a clean-wine program and would deliver to my doorstep.Wineries that produce clean wines generally avoid using pesticides on their vines — which, as a serious tree hugger, I applauded — or they follow biodynamic or sustainable practices. I also learned that because Americans tend to have a sweet tooth, many wines destined for their palate have concentrated grape juice added to them, which is basically another name for sugar. Do I really need more of that in my life?The chilled, clean wine was delicious and such a lovely shade of pink, so I sipped two generous glasses. After sleeping that night all the way through, I woke up the next morning feeling … spectacular. I ordered more wine in several varieties. Apparently, though, I wasn’t the only one making this discovery, because the company soon ran out of my favorite vintages.I had to find other sources, so I jumped on the internet. As it turns out, the wine industry is in a bit of a kerfuffle about clean wines. First off, I soon realized that the term “clean” isn’t strictly defined or in any way enforceable. Wines — as I knew but hadn’t really thought about — aren’t required to have an ingredient list on those artfully designed labels. They have to disclose that they contain sulfites, because some people are sensitive or allergic, but that’s about all they have to say. Which doesn’t seem quite right, does it?During my research I also discovered that I have something in common with 48-year-old actress Cameron Diaz, who experienced similar frustrations when she drank any old wine. Unlike me, though, Diaz has the funds and friends to take more drastic action: She founded her own clean brands ofwhite and rosé wines,which are organic and vegan and claim to be free of 70 icky ingredients that vintners are allowed to add to their wines, including sulfites, sugar and other additives. (Avaline lists its ingredients on the website.)I haven’t yet tried Avaline’s $24-a-bottle wines, but I appreciate Diaz’s jumping into the fray. Some wine industry experts say that the whole clean-wine movement is a lot of hooey, but can they really argue with more clarity in labeling? Or using fewer pesticides and unnecessary additives?Coffield — who also reminds her clients to drink plenty of water while imbibing  — is a fan (and affiliate) ofScout & Cellar, a woman-owned clean-wine distribution company. I’ve also discovered theLodi Rules certificationin California, a label placed on wine bottles that means that the vineyard follows verified sustainable practices, which enhances my sipping experience in multiple ways.Naked Wines,a wine “angel” program that supports mainly smaller vintners, including many women, also will deliver several Lodi Rules-approved vintages. I now do my best to drink exclusively cleaner wines and have been known to bring my own bottle to a socially distanced gathering. I’d rather risk slightly offending my host than suffer a throbbing, time-sucking hangover.Salut!","The morning-after brain fog was what I dreaded most.

Since none of those events would happen anytime soon, however, I had plenty of space and time to research and experiment on my body. Would “clean” wines solve my hangover woes?Serendipitously — or because social media can read my mind — advertisements for cleaner or sustainable wine started appearing in my emails and on my Instagram feed. I ordered half a case of rosé fromThrive Market, a sustainable grocery purveyor that had just launched a clean-wine program and would deliver to my doorstep.Wineries that produce clean wines generally avoid using pesticides on their vines — which, as a serious tree hugger, I applauded — or they follow biodynamic or sustainable practices. I also learned that because Americans tend to have a sweet tooth, many wines destined for their palate have concentrated grape juice added to them, which is basically another name for sugar. Do I really need more of that in my life?The chilled, clean wine was delicious and such a lovely shade of pink, so I sipped two generous glasses. After sleeping that night all the way through, I woke up the next morning feeling … spectacular. I ordered more wine in several varieties. Apparently, though, I wasn’t the only one making this discovery, because the company soon ran out of my favorite vintages.I had to find other sources, so I jumped on the internet. As it turns out, the wine industry is in a bit of a kerfuffle about clean wines. First off, I soon realized that the term “clean” isn’t strictly defined or in any way enforceable. Wines — as I knew but hadn’t really thought about — aren’t required to have an ingredient list on those artfully designed labels. They have to disclose that they contain sulfites, because some people are sensitive or allergic, but that’s about all they have to say. Which doesn’t seem quite right, does it?During my research I also discovered that I have something in common with 48-year-old actress Cameron Diaz, who experienced similar frustrations when she drank any old wine. Unlike me, though, Diaz has the funds and friends to take more drastic action: She founded her own clean brands ofwhite and rosé wines,which are organic and vegan and claim to be free of 70 icky ingredients that vintners are allowed to add to their wines, including sulfites, sugar and other additives. (Avaline lists its ingredients on the website.)I haven’t yet tried Avaline’s $24-a-bottle wines, but I appreciate Diaz’s jumping into the fray. Some wine industry experts say that the whole clean-wine movement is a lot of hooey, but can they really argue with more clarity in labeling? Or using fewer pesticides and unnecessary additives?Coffield — who also reminds her clients to drink plenty of water while imbibing  — is a fan (and affiliate) ofScout & Cellar, a woman-owned clean-wine distribution company. I’ve also discovered theLodi Rules certificationin California, a label placed on wine bottles that means that the vineyard follows verified sustainable practices, which enhances my sipping experience in multiple ways.Naked Wines,a wine “angel” program that supports mainly smaller vintners, including many women, also will deliver several Lodi Rules-approved vintages. I now do my best to drink exclusively cleaner wines and have been known to bring my own bottle to a socially distanced gathering. I’d rather risk slightly offending my host than suffer a throbbing, time-sucking hangover.Salut!"

",22-10-2020,Thigh High: 4 Quick Fixes for Your Sagging Quads,"Wearing only a towel, I paused in front of a full-length mirror the other day. Guess what was frowning back at me like two petulant toddlers?My thighs.There, slightly drooping over my kneecaps, were two upside-down smiles. Closer examination revealed that my thigh muscles were sliding south with a crepe-y (not the good kind) texture.What the heck? For someone who spends a pretty decent amount of time sitting or lying down, gravity should have been kinder to my quads.Turns out, that may be the problem. So I turned to the one person with the wisdom, experience and energy to fix my problem area: Denise Austin!“As we age, we lose muscle tone,” she explained. “If you don't use it, you lose it!“When you exercise, you’re helping your entire body have more energy. Exercise is key. But muscles are the miracle workers that help lift, tone and add tautness. We need to target and condition them — that’s where we’ll see results.” QUAD LIFTER The first exercise to firm up the thighs so nothing droops above the knee is simple! Sit on the floor and prop yourself up on your elbows. Bend one knee and keep the other leg straight out in front of you. Flex your foot and lift your leg up and hold. Then bring it back down. You can also do this exercise in a chair. Sit up straight and keep one knee bent and straighten the other leg in front of you. Flex your foot and lift it three inches higher than your bent knee.The straighter you sit up, the more you’ll work the entire quad from the knee all the way up to the hip. This is one exercise I do every day because it also conditions my knees and keeps them healthy. That’s really important. Do 12 reps on each leg. INNER THIGH TONER The inner thighs are among the most underused muscles of the body even when we walk or climb stairs. It’s hard to target the inner thigh without specific exercises. Stand up nice and tall and bring your right leg out to the side. Then bring it back down and across the front of your other leg almost like a scissor. Hold and squeeze your inner thighs and take it back. Try to flex your foot and keep both legs nice and straight. Add in a resistance band or ankle weights for additional benefits! Do up to 12 reps on each leg. BACK-OF-THIGH FIRMER/BOOTY LIFTER Let’s defy gravity in five minutes a day — that’s truly what I’m all about. There are easy exercises you can do to strengthen the back of your thigh that will also lift that booty! Lie on your back, bend your knees. With feet planted on the floor, thrust your hips up. You’ll feel all the muscles in your thigh engage — the front, the back as well as your tushy. The more muscles you engage in your thighs, the better.This exercise is very knee friendly. That’s the whole thing, I want to exercise, but I don’t want anything to happen to my knees. This will help protect your knees and hips because joints are so important. Do 12 thrusts. OUTER THIGH/SADDLEBAG SLIMMER Stand up tall (hold onto a chair if you need to) and bring one leg out to the side and back down next to the other leg. I call this my saddlebag slimmer. It really works to firm up the outer thighs and hips. It’s great for hip mobility, too. It really works! Lift each leg to the side 12 times.You can get all these exercises and more ways to tone up your legs — including your thighs! — inDenise Austin’s Stop The Clock Workout Plan: Staying Fit and Fab After 40!.","Wearing only a towel, I paused in front of a full-length mirror the other day.

",15-09-2020,Keeping My Ambitions to Myself,"At my subway station, homeless people pushed carts, sat on benches, and propped themselves up against columns, seeking shelter and money on a freezing winter evening.I emerged from the train car, a middle-aged woman in sophisticated attire.Farther along the platform, a heap of a young man sat on the ground, his back hunched against the tile wall, head down, holding an artfully lettered sign saying “PLEASE HELP.” It was my 27-year-old son, filthy, wearing a long skirt, his hair curly and wild, with a placid expression of equanimity across his face. Jolted, I knew he didn’t have a permanent place to live, since we kept in touch at least once a week.Yet I’d never seen him homeless on a subway station, particularly mine.I called his name, and he smiled at my stricken face. “Mom!” he said enthusiastically. “Just getting out of the cold. I’m spending the night at my friends’ house later. When I get a cell, I’ll call you. Do you want to hang out a little?” he asked, his brown eyes hopeful.The situation took a layer off him being everything familiar to me in the world, but I still felt the pull of my love’s invisible tendrils.“I can’t.” I forced the words out.I wanted to buy him warm pants, let him use my shower, wash his clothes, give him healthy food as I had so many times in the past. Yet confronted by this latest level of his reality and exhausted from work, I couldn’t do it. Not this time. As I shakily climbed the subway stairs, overwhelmed by tough-love guilt and my own survival instinct, images swirled in my head.The blond, fair-skinned infant with Guarani Indian eyes smiled, one of 14 other babies in a cottage on a dirt road in rural Paraguay. A 12-year-old girl changed his diaper on a cockroach-studded table, and my (future) ex and I were so happy to become parents. The next day we wheeled him in his stroller through the outdoor markets of Asuncion. Small, dirty barefoot boys collected bottle caps to turn to coins. We’d make his life better.Then, when he was 10, I became a single, working mother with sole custody, and he was my focus. The small yellow bus took him to his school for smart kids with special needs, where he prepared for college. The violin lessons, classes at art schools, and filmmaking projects at the Jewish Museum made him and me proud of his creativity, as did the hours of drawing at his desk by the light of his computer.He locked himself in his room after turning down a full scholarship to his dream art school, too emotionally overwhelmed by a breakup with his girlfriend to attend classes. Had I pressured him too much to have a productive life? Did I make him afraid of failure?Substance abuse fed his impulsive anger and caused my building to prohibit him from living there. I had gone into debt, paying for 16 months of residential rehab for him. He was an adult. The week before, after cleaning up in my shower with scrub salts, I took him to a local bistro. I thought that when he ordered French onion soup and grilled octopus, it would jolt his memory to the past 25 years, when his meals were ones of sensate pleasures and nutrition rather than just for survival.His perfect table manners and restaurant demeanor, which he pointed out were a part of me he carried with him, were intact.Desperate to fix things, I could no longer provide a home for him, but I could offer to assist him in reapplying to art school. Shared housing and a structured learning life leading to a profession from his passion would be his for the effort. He wanted this, but it was too alien from the street lifestyle to which his boyfriend introduced him two years before. He liked the freedom of the urban outdoors.He hadn’t reached his bottom, my therapist told me. How much further was the spiral down, I thought, as I looked at his body, folded into itself on the platform. Instead of fantasizing, as I did when he was a child and had written a screenplay, that I would be sitting at the Oscars one day and watching him thank me, I now hoped he would find something productive to do that he enjoyed and that he would earn enough to pay for an apartment. I prayed for his good judgment. I learned to see him as a person, out in the world, who has most of my heart but is separate from me.His achievements — or lack of — are not part of my identity. As long as we are in touch, we’re OK. I live life for my own ambitions. We had rescued him from the streets of Paraguay 27 years ago, but for now, he’s chosen the ones of New York.","At my subway station, homeless people pushed carts, sat on benches, and propped themselves up against columns, seeking shelter and money on a freezing winter evening.I emerged from the train car, a middle-aged woman in sophisticated attire.Farther along the platform, a heap of a young man sat on the ground, his back hunched against the tile wall, head down, holding an artfully lettered sign saying “PLEASE HELP.” It was my 27-year-old son, filthy, wearing a long skirt, his hair curly and wild, with a placid expression of equanimity across his face.

Do you want to hang out a little?” he asked, his brown eyes hopeful.The situation took a layer off him being everything familiar to me in the world, but I still felt the pull of my love’s invisible tendrils.“I can’t.” I forced the words out.I wanted to buy him warm pants, let him use my shower, wash his clothes, give him healthy food as I had so many times in the past. Yet confronted by this latest level of his reality and exhausted from work, I couldn’t do it. Not this time. As I shakily climbed the subway stairs, overwhelmed by tough-love guilt and my own survival instinct, images swirled in my head.The blond, fair-skinned infant with Guarani Indian eyes smiled, one of 14 other babies in a cottage on a dirt road in rural Paraguay. A 12-year-old girl changed his diaper on a cockroach-studded table, and my (future) ex and I were so happy to become parents. The next day we wheeled him in his stroller through the outdoor markets of Asuncion. Small, dirty barefoot boys collected bottle caps to turn to coins. We’d make his life better.Then, when he was 10, I became a single, working mother with sole custody, and he was my focus. The small yellow bus took him to his school for smart kids with special needs, where he prepared for college. The violin lessons, classes at art schools, and filmmaking projects at the Jewish Museum made him and me proud of his creativity, as did the hours of drawing at his desk by the light of his computer.He locked himself in his room after turning down a full scholarship to his dream art school, too emotionally overwhelmed by a breakup with his girlfriend to attend classes. Had I pressured him too much to have a productive life? Did I make him afraid of failure?Substance abuse fed his impulsive anger and caused my building to prohibit him from living there. I had gone into debt, paying for 16 months of residential rehab for him. He was an adult. The week before, after cleaning up in my shower with scrub salts, I took him to a local bistro. I thought that when he ordered French onion soup and grilled octopus, it would jolt his memory to the past 25 years, when his meals were ones of sensate pleasures and nutrition rather than just for survival.His perfect table manners and restaurant demeanor, which he pointed out were a part of me he carried with him, were intact.Desperate to fix things, I could no longer provide a home for him, but I could offer to assist him in reapplying to art school. Shared housing and a structured learning life leading to a profession from his passion would be his for the effort. He wanted this, but it was too alien from the street lifestyle to which his boyfriend introduced him two years before. He liked the freedom of the urban outdoors.He hadn’t reached his bottom, my therapist told me. How much further was the spiral down, I thought, as I looked at his body, folded into itself on the platform. Instead of fantasizing, as I did when he was a child and had written a screenplay, that I would be sitting at the Oscars one day and watching him thank me, I now hoped he would find something productive to do that he enjoyed and that he would earn enough to pay for an apartment. I prayed for his good judgment. I learned to see him as a person, out in the world, who has most of my heart but is separate from me.His achievements — or lack of — are not part of my identity. As long as we are in touch, we’re OK. I live life for my own ambitions. We had rescued him from the streets of Paraguay 27 years ago, but for now, he’s chosen the ones of New York."

",17-01-2022,How to Rev Up Your Postmenopausal Orgasm,"Along with hot flashes and sandpaper sex, add the sudden inability to have an orgasm to the list of postmenopausal surprises your mother “forgot” to warn you about. But if you are one of the many women whose fireworks have turned into barely a flicker, I have good news for you — really good news. A functional penis, intercourse and estrogen are unnecessary requirements when it comes to the path to achieving orgasm.This should be a huge relief to millions of postmenopausal women who are wondering if they will ever have an orgasm again. Don’t get me wrong, estrogen helps, but it is not required. Plenty of women have orgasms without a drop of estrogen in their body. What is required for that “happy ending” is a healthy clitoris that responds to stimulation. Decreased blood flow because of aging, low estrogen and damage to blood vessels from other medical problems — such as diabetes, cancer treatments, multiple sclerosis or vascular disease — all sabotage the ability of nerve endings to respond. Those tiny clitoral nerves require adequate blood to function properly.The solution is to wake up those nerve endings, which can be accomplished using one — or all — of the following strategies.Increase clitoral blood flowWhile estrogen isn’t required, a little estrogen can make a big difference.Local vaginal estrogen increases blood flow not only to vaginal and vulvar tissue, but also to the clitoris. I advise women who are having difficulty with orgasm to routinely apply a dot of estrogen cream directly to the clitoris.Arginine, aminophylline, testosterone or other vasodilatorscan be compounded into a cream that can be applied directly to the clitoris. While not well studied, anecdotally these products seem to increase sensitivity. Your gynecologist may not be familiar with these creams — so you may need to seek out a menopause sexual medicine expert to get a prescription.Drugs that are intended for arousal, libido or vaginal lubricationsuch as systemic estrogen, testosterone, flibanserin, bremelanotide and DHEA are primarily intended for other purposes, but along the way may dramatically facilitate the ability to have an orgasm.CBD and other cannabinoids have not been tested, other than in bedrooms around the country, but cannabinoids are vasodilators so it stands to reason that they may be beneficial. I tell my patients to apply some CBD oil directly to the clitoris around 30 minutes prior to sexual stimulation. Don’t forget to slowly rub it in! I have gotten rave reviews, though there are no scientific studies yet that specifically look at effects of CBD applied to clitoris. This falls into the category of “try it to see if you like it.”Pelvic floor physical therapyThere is evidence that pelvic floor physical therapy not only enhances the ability to have a satisfying pelvic floor contraction during orgasm, but also facilitates the ability of the clitoris to respond by increasing blood flow to the genitals.Increase stimulationMakes sense, right? If nerve endings are not as responsive as they used to be, you just may need to stimulate them more. If you were always able to have an orgasm with clitoral pressure, oral or manual stimulation, those maneuvers may no longer be exciting enough for nerve endings that are tired, older or damaged. Your battery-operated boyfriend or girlfriend is reliable, always good to go and — most important — almost always triggers an orgasm. It is critical that your vibrator of choice gives you clitoral stimulation. If you already use a vibrator to climax but are reluctant to use one during partnered sexual activity, I promise that most partners want to give you pleasure and will be happy to accommodate a toy to help the process. There are many vibrators that are intended to be used during partner sexual activities and can also be used during intercourse.What about Viagra?It’s so tempting … his little blue pills are sitting there, just waiting for you. Viagra and other phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors such as daily Cialis have been shown to increase genital blood flow in men. But they are not approved by the Food and Drug Administration and have not been widely tested in women. Having said that, there is data to suggest that these drugs can be effective in some women and are particularly helpful in women who have difficulty having an orgasm because of their antidepressant, diabetes or multiple sclerosis.The important thing is if your orgasm is history, you do not have to give up.

",8/7/2020,This Is Not My Mother's Midlife,"When my mother turned 50, we had a family party for her in our backyard. At the time, I was recently married and had just started a new career in retail management. It felt like my adult life was beginning just as my mother's life was, well, not ending but slowing down. Her wish as she blew out the candles was to be able to retire from her job and move to Florida, like so many of her friends were doing. Although she had been an avid tennis player, she no longer played because her knees hurt when she ran. Instead, her goal was to learn canasta and mah-jongg so she could bond with women she planned to meet in her not-so-distant-future retirement community. And she hoped I would make her a grandmother soon.I remember thinking that my mother was “old” when she turned 50, and yet as I headed toward that magic number, I didn't feel old. As my birthday approached, friends and family kept asking me, “What are you going to do for 50?” and what they meant was, “How are you going to mark the occasion?” Family dinner, trip, big bash or hide under the covers hoping it wouldn't find me? And while I did choose the party, my concern wasn't so much about how to celebrate the day but how to embrace the new decade.Instead of a midlife crisis, I had a midlife revelation. I was ready to start finding out who I was beyond being a daughter, wife and mother. I started thinking of all the places I hadn't been, both literally and figuratively, that I still wanted to get to. But to make it to all those places, I had to start taking better care of myself through diet and exercise.Although I began writing professionally in my 40s, it was in my 50s that I became willing to take more risks in my career. I realize that part of the reason I had not yet reached my goal of being published in the New York Times was that I hadn't dared to submit anything because I feared my work wasn't good enough. Maybe it wasn't, but I would never know if I didn't hit the send button and find out. My fear of rejection — something that colored my actions before I turned 50 — became dwarfed by my fear of not even trying. And while I haven't been published in the Times (yet) and have gotten a lot of rejections, I've also never had more professional success.Do I miss being younger? Of course. I miss having all my kids living at home. Those days were great days. But these are great days, too. Car pools have been replaced by road trips with girlfriends and my husband. And rather than watching my kids participate in sports, I have more time to get in the game myself on my spin bike or yoga class.What's more, my husband, instead of watching my kids play sports, is participating himself, in a 50-and-over league.I loved reading bedtime stories to my kids, and I also love that I have more time to read more books for my own enjoyment.I look around at my peer group and see that so many women in their 50s, 60s and 70s feel the same way I do. We aren't thinking, Wow, we are old; we are thinking, Wow, this is our time. Our time to take the trips we put off, to invest in our marriage (or get out of it if we aren't happy), to make a career change or to do anything else that feels right. Naturally, we still have commitments, jobs and people who depend on us, but we can make ourselves a priority, too.The best example of the new 50s is my friend Renee. Although my mother and her peers looked at their 50s as a time to stop working and move to Florida, Renee chose to do the exact opposite. She bravely hit the restart button as middle age approached. A Florida native, she always wanted to live in New York City and work in the theater. Instead, in her 20s she married, had children and helped her husband in his business. When her youngest was in high school, she decided it was her time to go for it, and she did just that. She got a divorce, moved to the city and landed her dream job.Renee is just one of many women rewriting what it means to be middle-aged. In fact, this past May, the Wall Street Journal ran a piece titled “The New Rules of Middle Age; Written by Women,” about recent books from women in their 50s and older. From 60-year-old Candace Bushnell's Is There Still Sex in the City? (the answer is yes! — at least in the suburbs) to 55-year-old Michelle Obama's memoir, Becoming, all of these stories reflect that there is still much more to come for women as they enter midlife. The book doesn't end at 50; it's just a fresh chapter, one with blank pages screaming to be written.So grab a pen, think about what you really want, and make what happens next the juiciest part of your story.","When my mother turned 50, we had a family party for her in our backyard.

116,"https://www.aarpethel.com/fulfillment/giving-away-an-old-cursed-wedding-gown
",22-02-2021,"Giving Away an Old, Cursed Wedding Gown ","My wedding gown has been sitting in the attic preserved and boxed since 1986. Now I’m contemplating the fate of that white satin gown with poufy shoulders and long lacy sleeves.I last came upon the box in 2009, when I was donating Robert’s clothes. After 23 years of marriage, I suddenly found myself a widow at 49. You rarely see tomorrow coming, but you do feel its wake. Not long after Robert died, my niece became engaged and I considered offering her my gown. What stopped me was the stigma attached to the dress, as fixed as the beading and lace appliques. My marriage had an unhappy ending: a death shrouded in secrecy and shame, a closet drinker succumbing to alcoholic hepatitis that wreaked havoc on the last years of our marriage.Would a dress that walked down the aisle and into a troubled marriage with an alcoholic be unlucky? I imagined the awkward pauses, my niece searching for a diplomatic way of saying: I’d rather walk down the aisle in my crappiest PJs.Now, 10 years after being widowed, I find myself thinking about wedding dresses. I’m getting married.With my friends Iyna and Claudia, we searched for gowns that didn’t scream MOB, bridesmaid or Forever 21, while avoiding those that didn’t feel bridal enough, harboring the threat of a guest showing up in the same dress.“I love the back!” Iyna said about a mermaid gown that made the first round, but not the final cut.“Game changer!” Claudia exclaimed, as I stepped out wearing the second favorite of the day.When I finally put onthedress, I exited from behind the curtain as a bride. Claudia and Iyna each let out a little gasp and grinned. There were a few seconds of silence before a rush of Oh-my-Gods and oohs and aahs.“Step all the way out here,” directed Claudia.I didn’t walk so much as glide, each hand holding folds of material, the connection between bride and dress immediate. It’s a sleeveless, off-the-shoulder, V-back gown with a fitted bodice in a shimmering champagne embroidered fabric embellished with subtle swirl designs and tiny crystals. The crinoline lining beneath the A-line skirt gives the gown movement — it’s designed to dance. Drawn to a larger wall of mirrors than the dressing room offered, I saw myself sweep into view, my 60-year-old Cinderella self smiling back.Sold.My new dress hangs in a zippered garment bag, awaiting the big day. My 1986 wedding gown is folded in a big box with a clear blue-tinted window showcasing the bodice, awaiting its fate. It reminds me of a packaged doll from yesteryear, standing tall and stiff behind a pane of cellophane. Frozen in time. Yet still wanting to dance.I vowed to liberate the gown from its box and find it a bride-in-need. Despite changes in style over the years, these once-worn gowns have common threads. Searching for organizations that accept donated wedding gowns, I came across Here Comes the Guide. The site lists several nonprofits encouraging the recently married to “Give the gift of your gown! You already said ‘I Do.’ Now you can proudly declare, ‘I Donate!’” But each organization noted the same criterion — no more than five years old. I glanced at the beaded bodice through the box’s window; it seemed blissfully unaware of its age.Determined to find it a home, I called Goodwill.“Do you accept wedding gowns?”“Oh, yes,” the woman on the other end answered.“Can it be old? It’s from 1986, but cleaned and preserved in a box.” My voice laden with apology.“Absolutely.”The next day as I walked out of the Goodwill shop, I felt hopeful that my old wedding gown would delight a new bride. Alterations will inevitably be made for size and style (goodbye poufy shoulders). When she walks down the aisle, she’ll have no knowledge of the gown’ s history.And then it dawned on me: I no longer viewed the dress as cursed. Saving it all this time and going to the trouble of finding it a home spoke volumes about my gown — and my marriage. Robert and I had many wonderful years, more good than bad. When I’d first thought of giving away the gown, I’d been too close to the bad years. Now, in the comfort of hindsight and starting the next chapter of my life in love with Billy, I’m able to put Robert’s alcoholism and its impact on our marriage into perspective — instead of automatically defaulting to the sting of our final chapter.On Nov. 9, 2019, Billy and I had a picture-perfect wedding with beautiful speeches by his daughters and Iyna, and aLove Actuallysurprise orchestrated by Claudia, with dear friends popping up to the tune of “All You Need Is Love” during the reception. The day was full of special times, including my Cinderella moment walking down the aisle.My old wedding dress is positioned to take on another life. Perhaps it will walk down the aisle again. Or find a home in community theater, entertaining people. Or its material repurposed. But my heart wants it to be taken home by a bride. I’d like to think my gown made someone’s wedding day extra special. Thinking back — beyond the bad — I remember how special it made me feel. Liberating my old gown from the attic liberated me from my past. We’re both getting a second chance to dance.","My wedding gown has been sitting in the attic preserved and boxed since 1986. Now I’m contemplating the fate of that white satin gown with poufy shoulders and long lacy sleeves.I last came upon the box in 2009, when I was donating Robert’s clothes. After 23 years of marriage, I suddenly found myself a widow at 49. You rarely see tomorrow coming, but you do feel its wake. Not long after Robert died, my niece became engaged and I considered offering her my gown. What stopped me was the stigma attached to the dress, as fixed as the beading and lace appliques. My marriage had an unhappy ending: a death shrouded in secrecy and shame, a closet drinker succumbing to alcoholic hepatitis that wreaked havoc on the last years of our marriage.Would a dress that walked down the aisle and into a troubled marriage with an alcoholic be unlucky? I imagined the awkward pauses, my niece searching for a diplomatic way of saying: I’d rather walk down the aisle in my crappiest PJs.Now, 10 years after being widowed, I find myself thinking about wedding dresses. I’m getting married.With my friends Iyna and Claudia, we searched for gowns that didn’t scream MOB, bridesmaid or Forever 21, while avoiding those that didn’t feel bridal enough, harboring the threat of a guest showing up in the same dress.“I love the back!” Iyna said about a mermaid gown that made the first round, but not the final cut.“Game changer!” Claudia exclaimed, as I stepped out wearing the second favorite of the day.When I finally put onthedress, I exited from behind the curtain as a bride. Claudia and Iyna each let out a little gasp and grinned. There were a few seconds of silence before a rush of Oh-my-Gods and oohs and aahs.“Step all the way out here,” directed Claudia.I didn’t walk so much as glide, each hand holding folds of material, the connection between bride and dress immediate. It’s a sleeveless, off-the-shoulder, V-back gown with a fitted bodice in a shimmering champagne embroidered fabric embellished with subtle swirl designs and tiny crystals. The crinoline lining beneath the A-line skirt gives the gown movement — it’s designed to dance. Drawn to a larger wall of mirrors than the dressing room offered, I saw myself sweep into view, my 60-year-old Cinderella self smiling back.Sold.My new dress hangs in a zippered garment bag, awaiting the big day. My 1986 wedding gown is folded in a big box with a clear blue-tinted window showcasing the bodice, awaiting its fate. It reminds me of a packaged doll from yesteryear, standing tall and stiff behind a pane of cellophane. Frozen in time. Yet still wanting to dance.I vowed to liberate the gown from its box and find it a bride-in-need. Despite changes in style over the years, these once-worn gowns have common threads. Searching for organizations that accept donated wedding gowns, I came across Here Comes the Guide. The site lists several nonprofits encouraging the recently married to “Give the gift of your gown! You already said ‘I Do.’ Now you can proudly declare, ‘I Donate!’” But each organization noted the same criterion — no more than five years old. I glanced at the beaded bodice through the box’s window; it seemed blissfully unaware of its age.Determined to find it a home, I called Goodwill.“Do you accept wedding gowns?”“Oh, yes,” the woman on the other end answered.“Can it be old? It’s from 1986, but cleaned and preserved in a box.” My voice laden with apology.“Absolutely.”The next day as I walked out of the Goodwill shop, I felt hopeful that my old wedding gown would delight a new bride. Alterations will inevitably be made for size and style (goodbye poufy shoulders). When she walks down the aisle, she’ll have no knowledge of the gown’ s history.And then it dawned on me: I no longer viewed the dress as cursed. Saving it all this time and going to the trouble of finding it a home spoke volumes about my gown — and my marriage. Robert and I had many wonderful years, more good than bad. When I’d first thought of giving away the gown, I’d been too close to the bad years.

",8/3/2021,The 5 Things I Want to Learn in My 60s,"Learning may never end, but as we age our motivation to keep challenging ourselves and trying new things, can. Science says this is often about a lack of confidence that results from a fear of memory loss. I’ve approached lapses in my own motivation with:Now that you’re all grown up, what do you want to do next? What do you want tolearnnext?With my adult sons living far from home, I’m itching to design my next decade from scratch. This admittedly is partly to fulfill unfulfilled dreams, partly to experience things I never had the time to experience before, and mostly because I figure I’ve earned the opportunity to enjoy myself. To that end, I’m working on myWhat’s Next? list. Not a bucket list, but a more positive, purposeful, ongoing set of goals. Big little dreams. My inspiration? Women likeErnestine Shepherd, who at 71 began training to become — and then became — a competitive bodybuilder;Julia Child, who wrote her first cookbook when she was 50;Laura Ingalls Wilder,whose first children’s novel was published when she was 65; andAnna Mary Robertson Moses, known as Grandma Moses, who took up painting seriously at 78 to great acclaim.MyWhat’s Next?ListThere are more than five things that I’d like to learn, of course, but for now, collectively, these are my North Star. They will keep me pointed in the right direction — and, more importantly, always looking up. How to Find My Voice Without Words Like most writers, it took me awhile to find my voice — to let it shift and shimmy until it became something I was comfortable sharing. As the years have passed, I’ve found myself looking for new ways of seeing and saying. On my 60th birthday, my sons gave me everything I’d need to begin painting. I had no idea how to paint, I only knew I had to try. And try I did. Right from the beginning, painting took me away. It was a beautiful escape from reality. I’ve still not taken a class. I will. But for now, without rules, I’m free to not overthink, and to find my voice ... again, but differently — on canvas. How to Make — and Drink — a Martini Confession: I’ve never had a shot of liquor. Or a martini. When my coworkers were doing Jell-O shots in our 20s, I was thinking,Why not just eat the Jell-O and skip the shot?But cocktail connoisseurs have identified the martini as the most popular nightcap. James Bond and his “shaken, not stirred” martini made the whole process look crazy sexy. In a nod to James, and my editor, Iris (who's mastered martinis), I’m looking forward to researching, tasting and sharing my martini trials. Who knows, a new art form might take shape from it all. How to Mentor Better I've been lucky to be mentored by a few very special souls. The shot of adrenaline they’ve supplied has usually come when I needed it most. Though I’ve tried to mentor and encourage informally for years, my interest now is in finding a more formal way to remind others of their worth — to help them create their ownWhat’s Next?list. I love this concept, from a story about mentoring: “a mentor is someone who speaks with you.” Thewithpart is everything. A mentor doesn’t talkto,orover,butwith. How to Plank for More Than 3 Minutes Without It Feeling Like an Hour I consider it a miracle that my chicken arms support me for a three-minute plank. But let’s get real: it’s three minutes. The longest plank recorded by a woman is 4:19:55. I’m not a math genius, but that seems like a lot more minutes. A lot more understanding of the right balance of protein, calories and sleep required to build muscle. Clearly, I’m going to need to try harder. Strength is freedom, and I want to lift and bend and twist and dance for a long time to come. How to Make My Grandmother’s Chicken Soup When I was a girl visiting my grandmother in New York, she’d take me with her to the butcher. We walked there, and I got to push her empty folding cart all the way, then pull it all the way home, filled with parts of the chicken I didn’t want to think about. Back in her kitchen, I’d watch as she spent the day making soup.Occasionally, I was allowed to help her chop ingredients, her plump fingers guiding me so I wouldn’t cut myself. “You have the hands of a pianist,” she said, “so delicate.” She’d pluck the stray feathers from the chicken’s wings and place the poultry in a giant pot of boiling water. There were multiple vegetables peeled and chopped; herbs washed, patted dry and bundled; multiple chicken drippings; a few rounds of fat skimming; lots of tasting with tiny spoons; and copious quantities of flat noodles cooking in another pot. It all took forever, and by the time we ate, the soup had achieved, at least in my mind, perfection. The anticipation was everything.I want to feel that way again — that food can express love, simple ingredients can be beautiful, and that my grandmother is never far, even though she’s no longer here with me physically.Raison D'êtreIf we avoid trying new things, we might miss the opportunity not only to discover more about who we are, but to rekindle memories that inform our creativity and help us find meaningful perspective to share with others. So give it a try, make your ownWhat's Next?list — and find your North Star.","Learning may never end, but as we age our motivation to keep challenging ourselves and trying new things, can.

",26-04-2021,Can Boomers and Millennials Groove to the Same Tunes?,"My musical education began in the 1950s with my brother Jay. He was 10 years older and I revered whatever he loved. He introduced me to music from the silly (“Flyin’ Purple People Eater”) to the melodic (“The Lion Sleeps Tonight”).I ridiculed my parents’ musical tastes. “I love Russ Columbo!” my mother would croon with more than a tinge of lust, craving more than his baritone voice. “Who?” I responded, unconvinced music preceded Elvis. Why would I be interested in anyone born in 1908? But my mother swayed to his most famous tune, “You Call It Madness, But I Call It Love.” Columbo was known as the Valentino of radio.Years later, when I married, I debated my father-in-law’s claim, “There hasn’t been a decent musical written sinceMy Fair Lady.”What aboutWest Side Story,a year later?Hair? Rent? Hamilton?Must every generation make claim to their own musical devotion? Back in college, my friends and I vowed to never turn into clueless codgers, who believed the Stones were an evil influence. We wouldneverfall into the trap of not knowing musical icons of the day.I shocked my mother by curating a playlist of Beatles songs to accompany me walking down the aisle. She argued that the only music suitable for my wedding was “Sunrise, Sunset.” I forbade the bandleader from playing it, but he listened to my mother rather than the bride.When my daughter was born, I wanted to introduce her to the soundtrack of my life. I foolishly believed I had superpower influence over her tastes and path in life. Determined not to live in the house of endless “Wheels on the Bus,” I brought my daughter to outdoor music festivals. She was more interested in climbing trees, but I hoped snippets of Mozart’s concertos would sink into her formative brain.I took her to Broadway shows as soon as she could sit still, pleased that she was falling in love with show tunes. In fifth grade, after seeing “The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee,” she broke into a loud rendition on a busy street about an unfortoo-nate erection, echoing the song that had been delivered humorously by Will Roland. I smiled at passersby, delivering my best I’m-not-a-creepy-mom look.There were sharps and flats along the way. While driving home from a soccer game with three sleeping girls in smelly socks in the back seat, my husband snapped “Desolation Row” into the CD player, eleven minutes long! Our daughter woke up, horrified, hating the song that never ends. For years she joked that this was the most traumatic event in her young life.She claimed Dylan and Neil Young were the same person: old guys with squeaky voices and boring lyrics. In the Venn diagram of our family’s musical tastes, raspy folkies were on one outer circle, Top 40 on hers (Beyoncé, Rihanna, Taylor Swift), but our family could still enjoy a shrinking middle ground of music.Mixing cookie dough on cold winter nights, we harmonized to Sondheim. Meanwhile, her friends’ parents repeated my own parents’ mantra: “Turn that awful music down!” Except for the everlasting Beatles. Even though they broke up 50 years ago, in the past two years their music has been streamed 1.7 billion times—nearly 50 percent of it by people ages 18 to 29. Springsteen, however, doesn’t cross generational lines. “Taylor Swift is the millennial Bruce Springsteen,” claims Emily VanDerWerff inVox.As if preordained, I began to lack familiarity for artists my daughter bounced to in college. Lady Gaga was so over the top and avant-garde in appearance, I didn’t see through to her talent. It’s an homage to my mother that I gained admiration for Gaga when she collaborated with Tony Bennett.On one long vacation car trip, my daughter initiated a game in which she, my husband and I would each take turns choosing a song, and she’d play each selection on iTunes. It was a family turning point, where we were all introduced to new music. I liked her selection of female folky sister bands serenading us, like First Aid Kit and Haim. I was surprised when she picked Joni Mitchell, my favorite folkie she’d yawned at before. We both sang along to “Both Sides Now,” an apt song for our merging musical preferences.My daughter’s influence was never stronger than during the pandemic. I’d lost the use of my pool, where I swam laps. Averse to power walking, I needed inspiration to get me moving and keep me moving.“Go onto GRL FKN PWR,” she advised me on FaceTime from her own apartment. It was a dance cardio workout on Spotify created by 305 Fitness. I was dubious, but this playlist was AWSM. Who knew I’d be strutting to Little Mix and Demi Lovatto? Burning calories on the street, I was Christina Aguilera’s “Fighter” and Ariana Grande’s “Dangerous Woman.”My daughter still refuses to listen to Dylan, in spite of his Nobel Prize. But we both dance together belting out every word ofHamilton.Recently we were doing a jigsaw puzzle. She clicked Spotify, saying, “I’ve become more mellow.” She introduced me to Jensen McRae, an L.A. folk-alternative-pop songwriter who explores political and racial themes in a bluesy voice. Born the same year as my daughter, McRae cites James Taylor, Carole King and Stevie Wonder as her influences. The music ofmygeneration!  I’m back in time, strumming my guitar with my college roommates.My daughter makes me a playlist. I embrace Phoebe Bridgers and Samia. The middle ground of our tuneful tastes has enlarged.

119,"https://www.aarpethel.com/lifestyle/are-we-still-ourselves-without-our-stuff
",15-12-2020,Are We Still Ourselves Without Our Stuff?,"My husband and I are preparing to move and by preparing, I mean organizing and discarding, and by organizing and discarding, I mean theHome Editladies would be proud of me, though I don’t think Marie Kondo would. But all of this has made me wonder: Am I still me if I get rid of the objects I’ve surrounded myself with for much of my adult life, the objects that I once felt defined who I am?Waiting for a SignIt’s been a slow process. We were ready to move out when the pandemic unexpectedly moved in. So, we postponed our plans and waited for a sign: a heart-shaped bolt of lightning ... cats and dogs going vegan ... or for it to start raining spaghetti and meatballs. Anything that screamed,Hey,you’re good to go.NOW.While we hunkered down at home, the irony that I was simultaneously trappedandrescued by a house I’d long since outgrown was not lost on me. What once anchored us here — work and our children — no longer did. We were mostly just tethered to stuff I hardly looked at anymore. And to routine. There was comfort in that ... until there wasn’t, when I developed a profound longing for change.As you might have suspected, the spaghetti-and-meatball rain never happened, but pretty much everything else did, including job loss. So as soon as I saw a tiny clearing in the pandemic clouds, I said let’s do it,and allowed the chips to fall where they may. My husband, who hadn’t been totally on board, acquiesced.Now, here we are, sorting through our lives — and our possessions. Blame it on COVID-19, on age, on the length of time it took to get to this moment, but I’ve become neutral about the entire decision-making process, what stays and what goes. I’m Switzerland.Sorting Through a LifeThe objects I sift through are not divided intosaveandgive-awaypiles, but instead, into categories: practical, decorative, family and personal journey. For each item, I ask myself the same question: If I were standing in an empty room, could I feel like me and be happy without you?Most frequently, and surprisingly, my answer is yes. And I had no idea that I felt that way until now. Or perhaps it’sbecauseit’s now — this time in history, this time in my life — that I feel the way that I do.Want vs NeedIn my youth I had endless lists of wants. Somewhere along the way, the wants became more about needs, and I learned how to separate the two, especially when I began dusting objects more often than using them.I asked women via Facebook recently if there was something in their house that they really wanted when they were younger but that now they rarely use. The most frequent reply was (drum roll, please) fine china.Small kitchen appliances were a close second — the holiday gifts we give and get such as juicers, waffle irons, rice cookers, air fryers, pasta makers, spiralizers, bread makers and instant pots. They all made the list of rarely or never used gadgets we coveted at one time.Is There Something You Own That Defines You?I also asked if there was an object in their home that they felt defined them. And, if so, without it around, could they see themselves the same way? The most frequent reply: family photographs. One woman summed it up this way: “They are strategically grouped in case of fire. I could lose everything else but I would be devastated if I lost my pics.”Here are some other responses:My baton. I started twirling sticks as a tiny little girl and eventually got my first baton from what we called the 10 Cent Store. I went on to become a majorette in high school and my baton went with me to college and everywhere since. I’m older and stiffer now, but holding that baton reminds me of something I loved and something I could do well.— LizI have a pair of tiny red cowboy boots my Uncle Arthur gave me around 64 years ago. They were too small to wear even then, but he knew I loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They go on display wherever I live. They connect me to my past, and are also very cute.— BethThe eerily beautiful glass “sculpture” that we found in the burnt hulk of our dishwasher after our fire. It’s delicate but strong, with impressions of things that no longer exist. Even if it breaks or disappears one day, it’s an unforgettable symbol of survival, resilience, and transformation. I call it “the artifact.” —RisaMy mind went immediately to the mannequin head that sits in my kitchen. In late June of 2011, I landed in NY for a month-long sabbatical. As I stepped off the airport shuttle near Times Square, I saw her just outside a shop selling NYC souvenirs. She had a green foam Lady Liberty crown on her head. Her smile stopped me cold ... she gave me hope. It was a very traumatic time in my life — I was losing my home and my marriage, and my last child was leaving the nest. To this day she represents “the new me” that came home after those 30 days. I can’t help but smile every time I see her. — LisaSo, do I plan on living in an empty house? No. Do I need and desire what I once did? No. Still, I’llbring a reasonable array of belongings to our new place. Objects can enhance the quality of our lives from a practical perspective, and an emotional one. And enhancing quality of life is a good thing.Also, as the mom of 20-somethings, my hope is that they’ll eventually not only want some of these belongings but one day will have homes of their own to put them in. And that we’ll have the chance to visit and revel in the memories they inspire, together.Going through this process of giving up some of what I’ve collected has helped me gain something unexpected: a stronger, more defined sense of self. And that’s something I can take with me wherever the place I end up calling home.","My husband and I are preparing to move and by preparing, I mean organizing and discarding, and by organizing and discarding, I mean theHome Editladies would be proud of me, though I don’t think Marie Kondo would. But all of this has made me wonder: Am I still me if I get rid of the objects I’ve surrounded myself with for much of my adult life, the objects that I once felt defined who I am?Waiting for a SignIt’s been a slow process. We were ready to move out when the pandemic unexpectedly moved in. So, we postponed our plans and waited for a sign: a heart-shaped bolt of lightning ... cats and dogs going vegan ... or for it to start raining spaghetti and meatballs. Anything that screamed,Hey,you’re good to go.NOW.While we hunkered down at home, the irony that I was simultaneously trappedandrescued by a house I’d long since outgrown was not lost on me. What once anchored us here — work and our children — no longer did. We were mostly just tethered to stuff I hardly looked at anymore. And to routine. There was comfort in that ... until there wasn’t, when I developed a profound longing for change.As you might have suspected, the spaghetti-and-meatball rain never happened, but pretty much everything else did, including job loss. So as soon as I saw a tiny clearing in the pandemic clouds, I said let’s do it,and allowed the chips to fall where they may. My husband, who hadn’t been totally on board, acquiesced.Now, here we are, sorting through our lives — and our possessions. Blame it on COVID-19, on age, on the length of time it took to get to this moment, but I’ve become neutral about the entire decision-making process, what stays and what goes. I’m Switzerland.Sorting Through a LifeThe objects I sift through are not divided intosaveandgive-awaypiles, but instead, into categories: practical, decorative, family and personal journey. For each item, I ask myself the same question: If I were standing in an empty room, could I feel like me and be happy without you?Most frequently, and surprisingly, my answer is yes. And I had no idea that I felt that way until now. Or perhaps it’sbecauseit’s now — this time in history, this time in my life — that I feel the way that I do.Want vs NeedIn my youth I had endless lists of wants. Somewhere along the way, the wants became more about needs, and I learned how to separate the two, especially when I began dusting objects more often than using them.I asked women via Facebook recently if there was something in their house that they really wanted when they were younger but that now they rarely use. The most frequent reply was (drum roll, please) fine china.Small kitchen appliances were a close second — the holiday gifts we give and get such as juicers, waffle irons, rice cookers, air fryers, pasta makers, spiralizers, bread makers and instant pots. They all made the list of rarely or never used gadgets we coveted at one time.Is There Something You Own That Defines You?I also asked if there was an object in their home that they felt defined them. And, if so, without it around, could they see themselves the same way? The most frequent reply: family photographs. One woman summed it up this way: “They are strategically grouped in case of fire. I could lose everything else but I would be devastated if I lost my pics.”Here are some other responses:My baton. I started twirling sticks as a tiny little girl and eventually got my first baton from what we called the 10 Cent Store. I went on to become a majorette in high school and my baton went with me to college and everywhere since. I’m older and stiffer now, but holding that baton reminds me of something I loved and something I could do well.— LizI have a pair of tiny red cowboy boots my Uncle Arthur gave me around 64 years ago. They were too small to wear even then, but he knew I loved Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. They go on display wherever I live. They connect me to my past, and are also very cute.— BethThe eerily beautiful glass “sculpture” that we found in the burnt hulk of our dishwasher after our fire. It’s delicate but strong, with impressions of things that no longer exist. Even if it breaks or disappears one day, it’s an unforgettable symbol of survival, resilience, and transformation. I call it “the artifact.” —RisaMy mind went immediately to the mannequin head that sits in my kitchen. In late June of 2011, I landed in NY for a month-long sabbatical. As I stepped off the airport shuttle near Times Square, I saw her just outside a shop selling NYC souvenirs. She had a green foam Lady Liberty crown on her head. Her smile stopped me cold ... she gave me hope. It was a very traumatic time in my life — I was losing my home and my marriage, and my last child was leaving the nest. To this day she represents “the new me” that came home after those 30 days. I can’t help but smile every time I see her. — LisaSo, do I plan on living in an empty house? No. Do I need and desire what I once did? No. Still, I’llbring a reasonable array of belongings to our new place. Objects can enhance the quality of our lives from a practical perspective, and an emotional one. And enhancing quality of life is a good thing.Also, as the mom of 20-somethings, my hope is that they’ll eventually not only want some of these belongings but one day will have homes of their own to put them in.

Tattoo shops have largely been shuttered, and pretty much all hair transplants — including plugs — are elective surgeries that are discouraged right now.

Things were moving along merrily until she made a little joke about gaining a few pounds during her COVID sequester and how she hoped Weight Watchers still offered lifelong memberships. He responded with an emoji. Mind you, not the ubiquitous happy face emoji that conveys “that’s funny” or “great.” No, this was a strange and unfamiliaremojithat, when later passed around among her friends, drew interpretations ranging from “I’m stunned and not in a good way” to “Well, that’s unfortunate news.

Even the enlightened ones struggle sometimes with how to communicate in an honest, respectful and unhurtful way that recognizes the concerns of modern older women. Here are some of the things men say that date them, make them sound out of touch or show that they just plain don’t recognize the societal changes that have occurred over the past half century or so.Those “my wife is the boss of me” sayingsWe’ve all heard them: “A happy wife makes a happy life,” the ubiquitous “Yes, dear,” or that perennial favorite, “Ask the missus.” What these sayings have in common is that they convey the message that you, the man, are (falsely) claiming to be powerless — subject to the whims of a woman. And that you, the man, have no voice in the decision-making that goes on in your relationship and that this, somehow, is all supposed to be seen as adorable and appealing to women. Sorry, dude, but no.Saying these things ignores the fact that men still have vastly more power than women in pretty much every aspect of existence. And it further ignores the fact that what many women really want anyway are partners, not subjects whom they can lord over.Further, can we all just agree that Henny Youngman is long dead? While a successful comedian in his day, the day when it was considered funny to mock your wife and marriage has long passed. So, no more “Take my wife, please.”Those sayings that deny our feelings and dismiss usLet’s start with “Calm down,” the command that men use in the midst of a heated discussion even though it has literally failed 100 percent of the time when uttered. Saying “Calm down” does exactly the opposite; it infuriates. It’s akin to waving a red cape in front of a charging bull.Why? Because women hear it as, “You are behaving hysterically and acting too emotionally.” It not only fails to calm anyone down, it infuriates women when they are trying to be heard and have their feelings validated. A raised voice is a frustrated voice. If you want to lower that voice, acknowledge that you’ve heard it. Closely related to “Calm down” is the dismissive “What is it now?” Saying that only serves to convey your impatience and anger with having to speak to us about a subject you clearly feel uncomfortable about. You are missing a big opportunity here to delve deeper into what’s going on with us. Try “I’m glad you are willing to talk to me.”Those sayings that infer judgement on us according to someone else’s standards of what a woman should do and be“Did you really just eat all those fries?” or on the flip side, “Is that all you’re going to eat?” are observations probably best left unspoken. Men don’t control what and how much a woman should eat. Many of us grew up in an era when women were valued by their appearance. That time is over. Don’t tell me I should “smile more” — ever say that to a man? And for the love of all things good, please don’t encourage me to order dessert and then comment after how I must have a sweet tooth. That’s a setup.Those sayings you mean as compliments and kind of really aren’t“You look great. How much weight have you lost?” Let’s start by just saying being judged on appearance is just not in anyone’s best interest. A simple “So nice to see you again,” suffices and keeps you on inoffensive ground. In this particular case, try flipping this so-called compliment on its tail.

",25-01-2021,Our Two-Week Safecation Road Trip,"In Kilgore, Idaho, we were about to turn onto a 15-mile gravel-and-dirt road when a bison wandered onto the highway. It lumbered by our RV, at one point a mere 18 inches away from us, as we watched, stunned by its size, its casual gait, its command of the space around it.Those are a couple of sentences I never expected to write. Like the rest of the world when the pandemic hit, my husband, Peter, and I found ourselves trying to figure out what to do with our lives. Peter had just resigned from a job in which he had been miserably unhappy. He was confident he would find more work in the airline and aerospace industries, where he has spent most of his 38-year career.As a freelance writer, I didn’t feel much of a change in my work life during the pandemic. Still, it was a big adjustment having Peter home most of the time; as luck would have it, jobs in the aerospace and airline industries had become rare. After months of household projects, gardening, reading many books, watching too much of the news, Zoom parties and hours spent discussing what we were going to do when “this” was all over, we decided to do something Peter has wanted to do for as long as I’ve known him.We rented an RV and went on a road trip. I realize RV trips are a regular part of many people’s lives. For me, the idea of traveling in an RV sounded romantic. Still, the facts — the small space, the less-than-luxurious accommodations, the great outdoors, the many hours of driving — seemed daunting. I knew two things, though. Peter really wanted to do this and, because neither of us wanted to fly, it was the only way we were going to get away from home and see anything new — which we very much needed to do.So, we threw ourselves into planning what we came to call our “safecation.” Traveling in an RV for two weeks takes a considerable amount of preparation, but I am an excellent planner. I made lists of food to bring and supplies to buy and itineraries. I printed maps and contacted RV parks. Peter bought hammocks and a small propane grill. We packed everything in large containers, picked up the RV, loaded the containers into the RV and then bought lots of food and bottled water. Then we headed out on an unexpectedly fantastic two-week vacation.The RV parks we chose were in some of the most remote parts of the eight states we traveled through, including California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Utah and Nevada. Because of that, Google maps took us on small highways with fantastic scenery, some like we had never seen before.While we were driving, we didn’t talk much; we were too busy looking out the window. We saw multicolored mountains, countless cows and endless bales of hay, dusty fields that suddenly turned into bright green acres of grass, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and streams, abandoned houses that were as beautiful as they were iconic. In places, fire-scorched acres interrupted the beauty, softened by new growth poking up through the burnt trees.We drove through tiny little towns with populations numbering in three figures and no stoplights. Still, there was always a church and a gas station, and the towns seemed peaceful, and I hoped as pleasant as Mayberry. We stopped for coffee and doughnuts and cupcakes at small coffee shops where everyone wore masks. While some people were wary of us, most were friendly. We were strangers, and it’s a strange time.There were a few bumps along the winding roads. For most of the trip, WiFi and cell service were spotty, and in some places nonexistent. RV camps, for the most part, offer access, but depending on how many guests are using it, or how remote the camp is, it is unreliable. In a way, being offline added to the experience instead of detracting from it — I read six books on the trip since there weren’t any notifications or updates to distract me.Our bed was small, uncomfortable and crowded with Peter me, and our dog (who was a champion traveler) all vying for space. The shower was less than satisfactory, to put it mildly. RVing involves feeling grimy most of the time. Many of the camps didn’t allow open flames due to fire season, so we were glad we had a propane grill — fine for burgers, but not so great for the s’mores I had looked forward to enjoying, but we made it work. After all, what’s camping without s’mores?For two people who are not very adventurous, this trip brought some much-needed excitement into our lives. The pandemic had sapped so much of our energy. Peter turned 60 this year, and I’m not far behind. It felt like we were being pushed into old age a lot sooner than we anticipated, being confined to our home and, for Peter, not working. It made for a lot of angst. As good as our marriage is, our lives, just like so many other people’s, were robbed of much joy. Seeing so many unique and beautiful places, pretty much right in our backyard, was something we would never have done before this pandemic.We were delighted and amazed by how much we enjoyed ourselves. Of all the things we saw, that bison in Idaho was our favorite. He was just so comfortable with himself. Driving almost 3,000 miles together, my husband and I were comfortable, too. It was a good trip.Extra tip: YouTube videos are terrific for learning how to pack and shop for an RV.","In Kilgore, Idaho, we were about to turn onto a 15-mile gravel-and-dirt road when a bison wandered onto the highway.

After months of household projects, gardening, reading many books, watching too much of the news, Zoom parties and hours spent discussing what we were going to do when “this” was all over, we decided to do something Peter has wanted to do for as long as I’ve known him.We rented an RV and went on a road trip. I realize RV trips are a regular part of many people’s lives. For me, the idea of traveling in an RV sounded romantic. Still, the facts — the small space, the less-than-luxurious accommodations, the great outdoors, the many hours of driving — seemed daunting. I knew two things, though. Peter really wanted to do this and, because neither of us wanted to fly, it was the only way we were going to get away from home and see anything new — which we very much needed to do.So, we threw ourselves into planning what we came to call our “safecation.” Traveling in an RV for two weeks takes a considerable amount of preparation, but I am an excellent planner. I made lists of food to bring and supplies to buy and itineraries. I printed maps and contacted RV parks. Peter bought hammocks and a small propane grill. We packed everything in large containers, picked up the RV, loaded the containers into the RV and then bought lots of food and bottled water. Then we headed out on an unexpectedly fantastic two-week vacation.The RV parks we chose were in some of the most remote parts of the eight states we traveled through, including California, Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Arizona, Utah and Nevada. Because of that, Google maps took us on small highways with fantastic scenery, some like we had never seen before.While we were driving, we didn’t talk much; we were too busy looking out the window. We saw multicolored mountains, countless cows and endless bales of hay, dusty fields that suddenly turned into bright green acres of grass, rivers, lakes, waterfalls and streams, abandoned houses that were as beautiful as they were iconic. In places, fire-scorched acres interrupted the beauty, softened by new growth poking up through the burnt trees.We drove through tiny little towns with populations numbering in three figures and no stoplights. Still, there was always a church and a gas station, and the towns seemed peaceful, and I hoped as pleasant as Mayberry. We stopped for coffee and doughnuts and cupcakes at small coffee shops where everyone wore masks. While some people were wary of us, most were friendly. We were strangers, and it’s a strange time.There were a few bumps along the winding roads. For most of the trip, WiFi and cell service were spotty, and in some places nonexistent. RV camps, for the most part, offer access, but depending on how many guests are using it, or how remote the camp is, it is unreliable. In a way, being offline added to the experience instead of detracting from it — I read six books on the trip since there weren’t any notifications or updates to distract me.Our bed was small, uncomfortable and crowded with Peter me, and our dog (who was a champion traveler) all vying for space. The shower was less than satisfactory, to put it mildly. RVing involves feeling grimy most of the time. Many of the camps didn’t allow open flames due to fire season, so we were glad we had a propane grill — fine for burgers, but not so great for the s’mores I had looked forward to enjoying, but we made it work. After all, what’s camping without s’mores?For two people who are not very adventurous, this trip brought some much-needed excitement into our lives. The pandemic had sapped so much of our energy. Peter turned 60 this year, and I’m not far behind. It felt like we were being pushed into old age a lot sooner than we anticipated, being confined to our home and, for Peter, not working. It made for a lot of angst. As good as our marriage is, our lives, just like so many other people’s, were robbed of much joy. Seeing so many unique and beautiful places, pretty much right in our backyard, was something we would never have done before this pandemic.We were delighted and amazed by how much we enjoyed ourselves. Of all the things we saw, that bison in Idaho was our favorite. He was just so comfortable with himself. Driving almost 3,000 miles together, my husband and I were comfortable, too. It was a good trip.Extra tip: YouTube videos are terrific for learning how to pack and shop for an RV."

Before receiving the invite, he repeatedly asked, “Did you see anything about my reunion?” I assumed that meant, he wanted to go. Well, you know what they say about assuming.He went to his 20th reunion and had fun. Afterward he even signed up for a Facebook account, or rather I signed him up since he doesn't use any technology created after 1989 except for a cellphone (as an actual phone, no texting, emails or internet). But I digress — hislack of technology useis a whole other topic. Back to the Facebook account — his main reason for signing up was to find out about the next reunion. When he saw pictures of the 25th reunion, which no one had informed him about, he asked me to immediately deactivate his account.

One of his concerns was that he wouldn't remember anyone's name. I reminded him that is why people wear name tags. He also worried that no one would recognize him.Like a Rogerian therapist I listened, allowing him to carry on his own conversation, occasionally nodding. Despite hearing him, I didn't understand his reservations because I've seen the photographic evidence and he looks the same. He could even star in the next 21 Jump Street remake because he's a carbon copy of Johnny Depp — okay that might be a stretch, but he possesses that same youthful appearance.With our meal finished and no resolution, we sat in the car.

",10/5/2021,Why I Can No Longer Share a Bathroom With My Husband,"My husband does this thing that makes my skin crawl and sets my last nerve aflame — though 25 years ago I adored this habit of his.I’ll be standing at the bathroom sink, flossing, plucking a chin hair or slathering lotion on my scaly-from-winter skin and he’ll walk up behind me, enveloping me in his warm embrace. Then he’ll nuzzle my neck and whisper something lovely, repelling me completely and sparking a civil war within my psyche.He loves me and is simply attempting to show me the affection that I’d welcome wholeheartedly any other time. When I’m grooming, though, especially when the task is kind of yucky or one I don’t want an audience for, what I’d really appreciate is some privacy. I want some personal space in which to conduct the often-unappealing business of beautifying.What’s odd about this, to me, is it represents a complete reversal. In our early days, my husband and I shared bathroom time for anything and everything. Nothing we did in there was off limits to the other or out of bounds.In fact, one of my fondest memories with my husband is of the time I was stuck sitting on the toilet after a raucous, overindulgent celebration of my 21st birthday. He kept insisting I pull my hair back with a scrunchie, diligently attempting to hand me one, over and over again. I finally appeased him and the second I did, I whirled around just in time to use the toilet in a different way.Does my about-face in attitude point to trouble in paradise? Shouldn’t we be even more intimate in all the ways by now, unfazed by normal acts of grooming in front of one another—especially after experiencing two childbirths together? He’s already seen me at my worst and most compromised. Nothing he observes or overhears me doing in the bathroom will ever compare.I attribute my change in attitude, preference and personal needs to approaching a saturation point. Kind of like how moms of small children no longer want to be touched by anyone by the time evening arrives. We give of ourselves to the point of approaching selflessness, a state in which we’re no good to anyone for anything. Even receiving affection is a form of giving when you don’t particularly feel like receiving it.Twenty-five years into marriage and motherhood, I now need some space and distance between my physical being and that of those I love while I’m in my bathroom. In my head, my desire to wiggle out of my husband’s embrace while I’m busy grooming feels unavoidable, an automatic reaction to his timing. But in my heart, I struggle to allow myself to feel this way.That I feel differently about our bathroom encounters all these years into marriage isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it’s just a thing. And it’s OK to choose to respect my own feelings and needs, without assigning extra meaning to them or assuming they call out any kind of malaise in my marriage.Once, nearly everything my husband did presented as interesting or sexy, charming or a window into his personality. Coming to know and accept each other’s habits and hang-ups, methods and madness was enthralling. But today, I’m not so keen on observing toenail clipping or nose hair trimming anymore. I don’t want to catch a glimpse of him washing his nether regions in the shower, nor hear him evacuating his bowels after a garlic-laden meal. And I don’t want a gallery while I draw on my long-lost eyebrows or disguise the increasing graying at my temples.As my husband and I head into our sunset years together, I’ve found I crave a little less transparency and visibility—the same things that used to foster deep intimacy between us—in favor of a little more mystery. I want the space to create a bit of mystique. As I age and my body changes, I don’t want a witness to the ways I cope.

Now it’s an unwelcome reminder of the toll that age, gravity, weight gain and breastfeeding three kids have taken. Forget lacey bralettes. These days I need an over-the-shoulder boulder holder.The last time I shopped for bras was a few years ago. I swear I tried on every bra in that department store until I finally found one that fit. So you can imagine how I felt this past summer when I had to come to terms with the fact that — thanks to a little too much emotional eating while sheltering at home — my boobs were no longer fitting snuggly within the confines of my 36D bras and that new ones needed to be purchased.I wasn’t about to spend hours in a department store in the middle of a pandemic. So, I did what any good journalist would do. I read articles about best bras for support. I checked out lingerie websites and scoured the reviews of their bras. Then I called an expert: Cora Harrington, author of“In Intimate Detail”and the founder and editor in chief of The Lingerie Addict blog.Support and Shape MatterHarrington recommends that women with pendulous (softer tissue) breasts that need support should look for full-coverage bras that will give them shape. I was disappointed that she didn’t recommend contour cup bras — my go-to — because she said they already have a shape that won’t necessarily correspond to your shape. The better choice is a seamed bra.“The vertical seam will guide tissue up, and the horizontal gives projection,” Harrington says. “They actually tell your breasts what direction to go.”Immediately, images of my 77-year-old mom’s bras popped in my head. But Harrington was quick to add that there are plenty of larger-cup, seamed bra options that won’t make you feel like your mom or grandmother.“You don’t have to put up with something that is unattractive,” she says. And well-made seamed bras should have an overlay that makes the seams less likely to show through shirts.Her picks for full-coverage, seamed bras for larger-chested women looking for support:Panache: Harrington suggests the Clara, Envy and Jasmine styles from this U.K.-based company that specializes in D-plus bras.Elomi: Her top picks are the Cate and Matilda styles from this U.K.-based company.Freya: For a molded cup style, she recommends the Deco.Size MattersTo get the right fit, you need to know your size. Harrington says there are two sizing methods — the plus-zero system and the plus-four system. If you’re buying bras online, check the brand’s size chart to see which system it uses.For the plus-zero system, measure around your rib cage,below your breasts. That’s your band size. Then measure around the fullest portion of your breasts (lean forward to do this). Subtract the band measurement from the breast measurement, and the difference is your cup size — 1 inch is an A cup, 2 inches is a B, and so on. For the plus-four system, add four to your rib cage measurement to get your band size.By using the plus zero system, I found out I actually was a 34 DDD/36 DD. However, Harrington says that your measurements are just a starting point.“There’s no shortcut around trying bras on and seeing what fits,” she says.I actually had ordered several bras online before talking to Harrington (all contour cups). I chose websites that offered free returns, knowing that not everything would fit. I do plan to test out some of Harrington’s recommendations, but here are the ones I found that worked best for me.Best for support:Vanity Fair Beauty Back Full Figure Underwire Bra ($27.99, Amazon.com).Best T-shirt bra:Wacoal Basic Contour T-Shirt Bra ($58, Amazon.com); Wacoal is Elomi’s sister brand.Best everyday bra:ThirdLove 24/7 Perfect Coverage Bra ($68, Thirdlove.com).If you’re on a similar quest for the perfect bra, keep this advice from Harrington in mind: “You’re going to have to try a few brands.

",24-05-2021,How I Learned to Trust Again After 2 Divorces,"I’m 55. I survived a physically abusive marriage in my 20s, followed quickly by two decades of a stable but emotionally empty marriage, where my happiness came from the joy of being a mother to three delightful, irrepressible kids.Both divorces were excruciating. Unfortunately, my first relationship following my second divorce — hang with me here — was a reunion with a high school boyfriend. This lovely man I’d known for 30 years lied, cheated and nearly destroyed me. I hit pause on romance.

I survived a physically abusive marriage in my 20s, followed quickly by two decades of a stable but emotionally empty marriage, where my happiness came from the joy of being a mother to three delightful, irrepressible kids.Both divorces were excruciating. Unfortunately, my first relationship following my second divorce — hang with me here — was a reunion with a high school boyfriend. This lovely man I’d known for 30 years lied, cheated and nearly destroyed me. I hit pause on romance.

",21-06-2021,Why I’d Be Absolutely Lost Without My Girl Gang,"It was either the suicide hotline or Lynn. I’d been crying on the bathroom floor for over an hour after a fight with one of my adult children that felt like an endless loop of love, miscommunication, failure and blame.Lynn answered on the first ring. Thirty minutes of snot, tears and wise counsel later, I picked myself up off the cold tiles and delivered an Instagram Live keynote presentation for my job.It wasn’t the first time. It was more like the 500th time. Lynn and I met in ninth grade. She was blonde and beautiful, yet so kindly, I couldn’t be jealous, even when she dated the football team captainandgot into Stanford. Two decades later, we birthed children 72 hours apart in the same hospital. Hers was the phone number I dialed when the mammogram showed black dots. Here’s my pithiest description: “You know those friends you can ignore for six months and then call sobbing at 5 a.m.? She’s one of those.”In other words, part of my girl gang. I’m not sure life is survivable without one.Take Rachel, my closest college friend. Rachel’s eyes grew wide when I confessed my first husband had started beating me — and then she sympathized and kept my secret until I was ready to ask for help. A few years later, once I was safely out, she had trouble getting pregnant; I was the first person she asked to fill out the adoption reference questionnaire. Although my mother’s funeral was a tiny, family-only event, Rachel showed up quietly in the back row of the chapel as I read the eulogy for the most complicated woman I’ve ever known. Years later, once life had returned to mundane issues like cooking nightly for a family of four, I ordered her an air fryer, without mentioning it.Weeks later, she was in her kitchen one morning, musing, “I could really use an air fryer to make dinner tonight.” Ten minutes later, her doorbell rang with my unexpected, impossibly huge box.I met Angie at 13, because we unknowingly shared a boyfriend, which is actually a surefire way to bond with another female. After college, we spent a long, sweaty day moving her out of another cheating boyfriend’s house while he was at work, one of us frantically loading the U-Haul in the alley while the other kept watch out front. Ten years ago, when I was in my physically safer but equally miserable second marriage, she put her hand on my forearm and quietly told me, “You don’t need anyone’s permission to leave him.”K.C., whom I met in corporate America, reminds me to negotiate for more money every time I sign a contract. Nurse Kay decrypted sexually transmitted diseases and condom brands when I became single at 49. Brooke leaves voicemail messages better than a therapist. And there’s research brainiac Trish, whom we rely upon to recommend the safest minivan, most romantic first-date restaurant, best infertility doctors and most trustworthy divorce lawyers.The truth is, women are built for sisterhood. Imagine going into childbirth 800 years ago, without an ob-gyn, hope of Pitocin or an epidural. Weneededa gang of women who had survived labor to get through ours. We still need each other to learn to care for our uniquely female bodies, to cook, to breastfeed, to outline the pitch for our next raise, pick out a relative’s casket, wrangle unruly teenagers, prepare a résumé when you’ve been a stay-at-home mom for a decade. I can’t imagine reinventing the wheel, alone, with any of these challenges.At times, I wonder how — and why — men go through life without such easy access to the emotional support and savvy smarts of a girl gang. Maybe that’s why men veer toward ill-conceived decisions like marrying someone 30 years younger or going skydiving at 69. Sometimes it strikes me that, although I’ve spent my life looking for soul mates, the only truly reliable romance has been with my female friends — that indispensable sisterhood.And what about the piped pipers of the mega girl gangs? The women who foundedMs.magazine in 1972. Voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. Activist Alyssa Milano. The women who formed domestic violence shelters in nearly every community in our country in the 1960s. The ’70s Boston secretaries who started the nine-to-five lobby for equal pay and protection from gender-based harassment of female office workers. The #MeToo movement that yanked the netting off sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and millions of other men. Annie E. Clarke and Andrea Pino, the 20-year-olds who started End Rape on Campus, providing data, counsel and legal strategies for millions of silenced assault victims.There are also a few who unknowingly failed the girl gang initiation.

The neighbor who helped my soon-to-be ex furnish his expensive new house, weeks before I knew he’d bought it. The mom who told my 6-year-old daughter that her son had punched her stomach “because he has a crush on you.” Celebrities such as attorney Phyliss Schlafly, evangelist Tammy Faye Bakker and the Women Against Feminism who promulgate sexist tropes. Ah, life. No one is perfect. But there is no point in having a girl gang if they don’t understand you — and the sisterhood.Of course, I do turn to my actual sister, an occasional therapist, male friends and colleagues, and even romantic partners for emotional support and counsel.  Self-reliance is important, too. But it’s the army of female friends — carefully selected, curated and cherished over decades — that is our wall of support as we face heartbreak, childbirth, abusive relationships, clogged milk ducts, colonoscopies, career conundrums, parenting problems and grief.

",21-06-2021,"I’m Still California Dreamin’, But Growing Old Here Is a Nightmare","I first laid eyes on California back in 1969, when I was a 19-year-old hippie. It was the ultimate destination of a cross-country pilgrimage I made with my boyfriend, traveling in an old Volkswagen camper van with four bald tires and brakes that worked most of the time except when we were crossing the Rockies.When we hit California, I knew immediately that I had arrived in paradise. The balmy, perfect weather, the surfers, the gentle rolling hills of Napa and Sonoma, the endless farm basket that was the Central Valley, and the Eastern Sierra mountains, with their pine-smelling perfume — I quickly became intoxicated by the golden light and sweet fragrance that was (is) California. Add to that the music scene of Laurel Canyon, the poets and writers who hung out at City Lights, the freedom to be you — no matter who you were.And the people! OMG, the people! How fabulous and tanned and lovingly eccentric they all seemed. Just as the state was sunny, sultry and beautiful, so were its people! I fell in love.California was everything New Jersey wasn’t. At least to me and the millions who flocked here starting back in the Gold Rush days. We all came to chase a dream, to find our better lives in America’s place of endless possibilities, where anything could happen and dreams could come true.Don’t believe me? Take Los Angeles, a city built on illusion if ever there was one. Perhaps the illusion comes from the movies made here, but find me a waiter who isn’t really an actor waiting for his big break, or a cab driver who isn’t writing a screenplay at red lights, or a handyman who isn’t a stunt double and asks if you can’t see his resemblance to Tom Cruise. New Jersey didn’t have people like that, people who lived their dreams so openly and boldly. No, that is a hallmark of California. I belonged on the Left Coast, and I knew it with every fiber of my body way back in 1969 as we drove over the Golden Gate Bridge into the Marin Headlands, camped on the beach near Carpenteria and hiked to the top of the Hollywood sign.It took a couple more decades of living in gray New Jersey, but when I turned 40, I uprooted and finally headed to Southern California to live permanently. It was I, my two dogs and a job atThe Los Angeles Timesthat awaited me. I knew no one, had no close family in California and was simply heeding the state’s siren song.“California Dreamin’” by the Mamas and the Papas might well have been blasting on my car stereo for the 3,000-mile journey. I tooted at any cars bearing California plates like I was greeting a familiar neighbor. They were Californians, I told the dogs, and soon we would be, too. I joked that I might need to dye my hair blond and my eyes blue.California is a testing ground for life. Changes are tried out here. This is a place where failure only occurs if you are afraid to challenge yourself. Californians, I quickly learned, were just as diverse and quirky as their state. They are like the people you hope to meet on vacation: committed to the pursuit of fun and hedonistic pleasure, and absolutely devoted to living in the moment.Looking back on my 30-plus years here, I can honestly say I have no regrets about watching New Jersey grow smaller in my rearview mirror. I met both my husbands in California, raised my two kids here and made a bundle on real estate, as well.I’ve made wonderful friends here. I’ve also lived through wildfires, evacuations, major earthquakes, slides (both rock and mud) and one El Niño that left my canyon an island for six weeks.I even commuted 26 miles each way in Los Angeles traffic for 18 years, which, according to my calculations, means I spent a full 12 weeks each year in the car just getting to and from the newspaper. Even so, it was worth it — all of it. That’s how deeply I fell in love with California.But as I turn the corner on my 70s, my California dreamin’ has become a California worryin’. Growing old in a state where showing signs of actual agingis pretty much discouraged scares me to death. California’s culture is a youthful one. Beauty is defined by the young. There’s a reason that Malibu Urgent Care offers walk-in Botox injections 365 days a year. I don’t want to be one of those older women who walk down Rodeo Drive looking like they get their face tightened every six months. If my plantar fasciitis flares up, no, I’m not going to jump onto a treadmill at one of the ubiquitous California gyms just to get my daily 10,000 steps in. I love bread, and I will never jump on board the gluten-free train to a smaller stomach. I once joked that I would always be 20 pounds too heavy for California. Now that I’m 70, make that 30 pounds.And then there is the practical side of living here. California is a car culture. While East Coast cities are vertical, those in California are sprawling horizontal places, a series of neighborhoods connected by superhighways and offering little in the way of public transportation. New Yorkers walk; Angelenos drive.What happens when I cannot drive anymore? How will I get around?California is also expensive. Housing, taxes, insurance are all among the highest in the country. Having recently retired from full-time work, I finally understand what a fixed income means: my earnings aren’t going to go up even though my bills certainly will. Do I really want to spend down my retirement savings just to keep basking in the California sun?One thing is for certain: I’m not ready to join the line of cars with California plates headed north to Oregon. At least not yet.","I first laid eyes on California back in 1969, when I was a 19-year-old hippie.

",26-07-2021,Finding Love Again After My Husband Was Murdered,"A man appeared in my kitchen on a Sunday morning last April and browned shiitake mushrooms for an omelet fashioned from leftover spinach, parmesan and egg whites in the refrigerator. He was back in the afternoon, crushing juniper berries with a mortar and pestle. These he used in his latest batch of gravlax. The day before, he spent hours pivoting between the stovetop and my mixer, constructing a miraculously light lasagna, complete with his Bolognese sauce and homemade pasta cooked perfectly al dente.I couldn’t have predicted this a year and a half ago. Then my diet consisted primarily of roasted vegetables, chunky peanut butter and Morningstar Farms spicy black bean veggie burgers. Oh, and the occasional chocolate Teddy Graham, my stress food.A serviceable cook myself, I was still striving to regain my footing following the 2018 murder of my husband, Rob, an editor at theCapital Gazettein Annapolis, Maryland. He and four other staff members were shot and killed by a gunman with a grudge who blasted his way through the small-town paper’s newsroom on June 28 of that year — my 58th birthday. The months that followed are a bit of a blur.In between worrying about our three kids, speaking out on gun violence and grading papers (I teach high school English in suburban Baltimore), I practiced a two-pronged strategy for staying healthy: I hit my basement treadmill daily and said yes to every social invitation I received.The truth is, I missed my husband, one of the gentlest souls on the planet, and I found it inconceivable that his final moments were filled with terror.

He reminded me that seizing such opportunities is fundamental to happiness because (as I know so well now) life is short.“Oh, and by the way,” he said, “you know I’m going to die first. Women always outlive their husbands.”I winced, thinking the conversation had turned abruptly morbid.“It’s going to take you about one year to find someone else,” he added. “And you should. You deserve to be happy.”Make no mistake, Rob, an avowed romantic, was not expecting to die at the hands of a gunman, and he was not expecting to die so soon.

Having interned as his clerk of court, Ben mentioned that Phil — whose wife died of cancer in 2013 — had offered to meet with me if I needed to talk about coping with loss.We touched on loss during our first restaurant meeting, in November 2019, but we talked most about music, travel, running and (you guessed it) cooking. I kept in touch on those topics via text the next few weeks, and by mid-December we met again, this time at an oyster bar.After Phil drove me home, he bravely asked if I’d be interested in a romantic relationship. We marked my affirmative answer with a slow dance in my kitchen, the first of many dances ahead.

Winter 2020 brought my first road trip to Phil’s beloved Adirondacks in upstate New York. Kayaking locally and in Virginia and South Carolina was a summer hit.Fall 2020 may top all. Phil officiated — and catered — my son’s small, socially distanced wedding, in our backyard. Yes, we danced at the reception.Yet, there have been challenges. I’m lucky to feel embraced by Phil’s three children. On the other hand, one of my children still vacillates between accepting my relationship with Phil and rejecting the idea that I could find happiness with a man who’s not Rob. Things seem awkward with my in-laws now, although I share a long-distance but caring relationship with most of them.And then there’s this unique strangeness of being in love with someone new even as the love for the one you lost endures. It resonated acutely in April, when Phil and I joined friends at one of Rob’s favorite destinations, Key West.

He was back in the afternoon, crushing juniper berries with a mortar and pestle. These he used in his latest batch of gravlax. The day before, he spent hours pivoting between the stovetop and my mixer, constructing a miraculously light lasagna, complete with his Bolognese sauce and homemade pasta cooked perfectly al dente.I couldn’t have predicted this a year and a half ago. Then my diet consisted primarily of roasted vegetables, chunky peanut butter and Morningstar Farms spicy black bean veggie burgers. Oh, and the occasional chocolate Teddy Graham, my stress food.A serviceable cook myself, I was still striving to regain my footing following the 2018 murder of my husband, Rob, an editor at theCapital Gazettein Annapolis, Maryland. He and four other staff members were shot and killed by a gunman with a grudge who blasted his way through the small-town paper’s newsroom on June 28 of that year — my 58th birthday.

",26-07-2021,"After a Hard Youth, Mom Found Beauty in Making Art","My mother reluctantly embodied her role of 1950s housewife. She was raising my brothers, who were 9 and 10 years old when I was born. Dad was the breadwinner; she was cast as an angrier and less patient June Cleaver. Her uniform was a housedress and Dr. Scholl’s orthopedic sandals.She served my father scrambled eggs before he embarked on a long subway ride into his Manhattan office. He returned at 6 p.m. and read the evening paper before sitting down to a dinner Mom prepared and then cleaned up. Her cooking style was burnt broiled chicken: unseasoned poultry parts stuck under the broiler until the top was charred. When my parents went to a friend’s house to play bridge, I heated up a TV dinner. Frozen fried chicken was my idea of haute cuisine.My father was a first-generation American, an engineer turned accountant who had a tax preparation business and also sold real estate in order to send his kids to college and support his widowed mother and mother-in-law. Every Thursday night, while Dad was in his bowling league, Mom took me to Nathan’s for dinner. Watching her drive, I could sense her joy in escaping the kitchen, guiltlessly feeding me a nonnutritious meal of hot dogs and french fries.On Tuesdays, Mom drove 30 miles away to compete in golf. She amassed a cabinet of trophies while I was charged with making the beds and vacuuming. I felt burdened doing her chores, but I wasn’t yet aware of the significance that she was no Stepford wife.She was raised in an orphanage until her teens and hadn’t been able to afford college. Although she’d dreamed of becoming a gym teacher, she worked as a stenographer right out of high school, making $780 a year.“My first job was high up in the Empire State Building,” she told me whenever we shopped on 34th Street, gazing up at the iconic skyscraper as if it were a mountain she’d once climbed. We’d devour cream cheese sandwiches at a Chock Full o' Nuts coffee shop, sharing the winding lunch counter with rushed professionals returning to work.She was a self-taught art historian, making me tag along at museums from the time I was 8, in spite of my protests of boredom.“You learn by listening to a docent,” she insisted, and for years I shuffled miserably along on endless tours. She’d stare at a huge Jackson Pollock painting, saying, “Isn’t he a genius?”All I saw was splashed paint. I wanted my mother to be like other mothers, who took their kids to amusement parks instead of the hushed sanctuaries of art museums.After I left for college, Mom started to paint. She copied the colorful circles of Alexander Calder, bright primary hues encased by black outlines. I thought her renderings looked childish, something a preschooler could master. I didn’t know that budding artists were apprentices at first, copying famous works before embarking on their own styles, eventually tapping into their full imagination.When my father retired, they moved to Florida. Mom was done being a housewife, as if her contract had expired. Every morning she left the cereal box and a bowl on the kitchen table for my father. Off she went to her newfound passion: sculpture.Again, she copied the masters, leaning toward abstract works. She spent all day in an artist’s studio with her chisel, hammer and protective goggles. “It gets her nervous energy out,” my father said with a smile.It was more than nervous energy that drove her to produce one creation after another: a large abstract circle with a hole in the center, a dolphin with a person hanging on its head and floating in the air, and a man bent into a contorted shape that Mary Lou Retton could never master.Politely, I complimented Mom — secretly preferring realism. She was thrilled when a community center honored her with a one-woman show. Afterward she draped the prize ribbon over one of her favorites, a curvy white alabaster sculpture of two overlapping oval shapes, which Mom described as fish. I didn’t see it, but I began to admire the way she transformed amorphous stones into smoothly shaped works of art.A corner of her apartment looked like a gallery, with figures perched on white stands of different heights. During my visits, I gravitated toward a woman sitting on a backless bench, hands folded, pensively tilting her head off into the distance.“I know you always liked this one,” Mom said, stroking the brown-and-white marbleized woman. “It’ll be yours after I’m gone,” adding that the ballerina, standing on one leg with graceful arms reaching toward the sky, was for my daughter.My daughter had long given up ballet for soccer, but that was how Mom wanted to remember her eighth and last grandchild. And she wanted us to remember her as a reinvented housewife.After Mom died at the age of 96, her children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren gathered in her apartment to select artworks from her collection. They marveled at dozens of sculptures, loose in a museum when all the treasures were free. Each sculpture came with a memory of my mother’s determination and artistic nature. Family members toted the heavy stones out in wheelbarrows.The next day I received an email from one of the great-grandchildren: “A part of Grandma lives on through her art. I’m grateful for this everlasting gift.”I found a newspaper clipping among my mother’s possessions, a feature story about lifelong learning. There was my 92-year-old mother’s photo in a sculpting class under the title: “DISCOVERING TALENTS.” She discovered her true talent in her 60s, leaving behind a permanent vision for the next two generations. She might not have been widely known to the world, but to her family, she was famous. Mom’s hopes of becoming a teacher had been squashed by poverty, but she evolved into a confident, proud artist.Living in a small city apartment, I could only ship home a small selection for my own collection. The seated woman remains my favorite. I think of it as a self-portrait. Whenever I pass it, I’m reminded that it’s never too late for dreams to be realized with courage, persistence and grit.","My mother reluctantly embodied her role of 1950s housewife.

",9/8/2021,I’m Not a Lesbian But My Wife Is,"When I was 40, I fell in lust with a woman. I was working as a girls summer camp director up in the far north of New England, trading my time for tuition for our three young girls to attend. It was a paradise of four weeks free from the heat of our home in Washington, D.C., where my husband and the girls’ father held down the fort. I was happily married — or so I thought. Our 14 years together was without a lot of drama save for the tangles over raising kids and pursuing careers. This is why my attraction and short affair with another female camp director was not only unexpected — it was life changing.Today, 23 years later, 21 of those with a lesbian, I can say I’m not alone in this experience of “going to the other side.” In the third edition ofMarried Women Who Love Women, the author notes in her foreword how much has changed around gender and sexuality since 1998, when the first edition came out.At that time, four labels were used — lesbian, bisexual, gay and straight. Today, a host of additional labels are added to the mix, including trans, queer, questioning, intersex, asexual, pansexual and polysexual. In addition, we have public figures open about their sexuality, laws changing, industries growing and the very notion of marriage as being between a man and a woman no longer assumed.It can even be cool to say you have two moms. The first edition of the book was still in hardback when I stepped into a now expired gay bookstore. I was seeking insight and solace around the shame, fear and worry about what I was going through and what it meant for my family. When I saw the above-mentioned book displayed prominently, I was both shocked and grateful, as if it was put there just for me.I was also embarrassed, so I took my time “finding” it and then quickly skimmed the contents knowing I could never bring it to the counter much less take it home. In the privacy of those moments, I wondered if this was me between those covers. Was I one of those women? Was I gay? Was I closeted and had no idea? Was I just going through a midlife crisis? Was it my marriage? During that gut-wrenching time, after my husband discovered the secret I tried to hide, he would ask me, “Are you a lesbian?” My answer was “I don’t know!”I had no idea what was happening to me or if it was temporary or forever. Friends would say things like, “I often suspected” or “I’m not surprised.” My deeply personal life was being examined and judged by others trying to make sense of the situation. I didn’t have answers for them, much less for myself. All I knew was that this was a dark time with an uncertain future. Not only could I lose custody of my kids based on a new identity, I would be losing the life I knew as a partner, a mother and a privileged member of the heteronormative society. Whatever this was, our marriage couldn’t survive the notion that mom might be gay or that I would try to hide my feelings. I needed to take responsibility and so we separated.I will never forget the day we delivered the news to the girls that our family would look different from now on, with Mom moving out and Dad staying at home. It remains a painful memory and one I sorely wish had never happened. It was like a death in the family. Not only was I breaking a promise of “till death do you part,” I was breaking our family apart.Two years later, I met and eventually moved in with Tanya, a fellow Westerner who shared my love of writing, art and the outdoors. From the beginning, she identified as a lesbian, knowing she was gay from an early age when she fell in love with her kindergarten teacher. When she asked if I considered myself a lesbian I said, “I’m not about having a label on my sexuality.”She accepted that though also pointed out how my perspective may be coming from never having to defend it. She was right. This was just one of many ways I navigated this new identity, twisting and turning not just internally but externally as I now had to consider where and when I felt safe to talk about my partner.In 2015, Tanya and I got married. All five of our children were part of the ceremony, including a set of twins she birthed and who were then 14. It was the same summer that gay marriage was legalized by the U.S. Supreme Court, though that wasn’t why we tied the knot. We did it because I wanted to honor all we had been through together. To give her the gift of recognizing our union in front of 200 friends and family. To make possible something she never imagined possible, or even desirable, given that marriage was an institution not built for her and so many others.Between those early days and now, I’ve worked to let go of regret and shame and to welcome grace and even gratitude. As I still resist the label of lesbian, I reflect on my life growing up in a small town in Wyoming surrounded by, and admiring of, strong women who were ranchers, skiers and business owners.Perhaps there has always been that part of me on the spectrum of sexuality, where no label felt quite right. This is why today I embrace each individual’s need to find their place on that spectrum, to declare their right to that spot, and to be accepted for it no matter what.You can reach Cindy Morgan-Jaffe via her websitewww.morganjaffe.comor follow her on instagram @parentmoneycoach","When I was 40, I fell in lust with a woman.

",16-08-2021,How to Pack for a Weekend — or a Week — in One Carry-On,"Those of us who backpacked across any country, continent or region in our youth find it hard to understand the epic, Kardashian-style packing of our current travel companions. There’s a reason you can’t spell luggage without l-u-g. Who needs an army of rolling bags and a convoy of porters when you can pack for a week in one carry-on?My own packing skills have been honed further over the past five years as I’ve regularly traveled halfway across the country to visit my aging mother. I’ve come to appreciate the flexibility my lone carry-on provides. If I’m running late, I can wheel it onto the plane. Or if it’s especially heavy — like the time I packed two stainless steel saucepans — I can always check it. These trips helped me figure out a system for packing that works just as well when I visit friends or go on business trips.Now that we are venturing beyond our pandemic bubbles to see family, friends and favorite places, it may be time to adjust the packing strategy. Here are 12 tips to help you fit everything you need — not everything you own — into one 22- by 14- by 9-inch bag, the most common dimensions for carry-on luggage on U.S. air carriers. Think of packing as a preview of your trip, rather than an annoying necessity.Have some fun with it. Envision yourself on your trip from landing to takeoff. What are you doing? What are you wearing? Are you hiking around Lake Tahoe? Taking a ghost tour in Savannah? Or checking out new restaurants in Manhattan? Each will require you to pack differently to match your mental selfies. As part of this envisioning exercise, be sure to check the weather.Create a capsule wardrobe.To fit into that one bag, your clothes will need to work together for maximum multitasking. For example, avoid taking six distinct outfits for a long-weekend getaway. Instead, pack pieces that can mix and match to provide you with optimal flexibility. The same goes for jewelry and accessories.Focus on two or three color themes, rather than packing the rainbow.Picking our favorite colors often happens organically, but it’s essential to make this a conscious decision when packing. It also supports the strategy of building a capsule wardrobe.Prints and patterns limit your options, so pack them sparingly.They are great accents, but you don’t want an entire suitcase of floral prints and animal patterns. Solids and stripes are a traveler’s best friend.Whatever the season, think layers.Adding a lightweight jacket over a sweater over a T-shirt gives you more possibilities to stay warm or cool off than one bulky, hooded sweatshirt. This is especially critical when visiting destinations where temperatures can shift dramatically during the day – either because of geography (mountains and deserts) or air-conditioned settings.Avoid taking your best clothes unless it’s for a special occasion.The same goes for items that just came back from the dry cleaner. Traveling is hard work, so rather than silks and cashmere, pack cottons that can stand up to the task. And linen may be trendy right now, but nothing will give you that rumpled, tired traveler look faster.Limit the pairs of footwear you take to three — the ones you wear and two others.It’s also possible to get by with a lone backup pair if you won’t be dressing up. Again, keep thinking capsule wardrobe.Wear the bulky.You can free up a lot of space in your carry-on if you don’t have to accommodate hiking boots or gym shoes. A heavy jacket or sweater can be tied around your waist or stuffed into a backpack with your book or computer.Lay everything out on your bed to see what you’ve got.Place similar items in a stack — tops, sweaters, pants, etc. — to make sure you have enough, but not too many, of each. Two tops a day is reasonable, and I usually plan on two days of wear for each pair of pants. Plus, they can always be laundered if needed.When you’re ready to start putting items into your bag, place the heavier ones at the bottom(when the bag lies flat or stands up). Place more durable items, such as jeans and a laundry bag, on the outside and more delicate items toward the middle. Rather than filling one large cosmetics bag, split items between a couple of smaller bags that often come in a gift-with-purchase set. Tuck these smaller bags into gaps along the edges or interior pockets. Use soft pieces like leggings and pajamas to cushion anything that’s fragile and to create a barrier between cosmetic bags and more vulnerable clothing. Reward yourself for having a little extra room.Give yourself permission to break one packing rule — say, by adding another print piece or another pair of shoes. But only if you have room at the end.But never, ever break the cardinal rule: Allow yourself enough time to pack properly.An hour is good, but 90 minutes is better. Rushing is the surest way to forget essentials — even obvious ones like underwear.

",30-08-2021,Leaving My Legacy to Family While I’m Still Alive,"Every day is a gift.That’s a familiar phrase we’ve all heard or said in some form in our lives. In fact, it’s such a cliché that we sometimes lose sight of the real truth in it. My experiences during the pandemic have crystalized the importance of that simple yet profound statement, it has led me to examine my priorities and consider what legacy I’m leaving. I feel comfortable that my 30-year career has left a body of work that speaks to my professional legacy. I’m looking now at the personal legacy I’m leaving for my children and my grandchildren. This, in the here and now, is at the heart of it.Whether one realizes it or not, we are building a legacy with each new day we are given. Each choice we make, every word we say and action we take contributes to the ""who"" of each of us. As we reach a certain age especially, the questionwhat legacy am I creating?rises in our consciousness. Is it a positive one that you are proud to leave behind? Are you addressing the final chapter in your life — however many decades it may be—with reflection and intention?Believe me, I know how easy it is to get swept up in life’s big wave of busyness. Job demands, medical challenges, family needs, financial questions, tragedies ... the list goes on. I’ve been riding that wave. With two new books coming out in a matter of weeks, I still am. The difference, however, is that now I’m choosing to ride the wave withintention.What does that mean? It’s back to choices. I am choosing the direction I want to go instead of allowing the wave to push me along haphazardly. I am choosing to pause and take a breath, smell the roses, walk more, call a friend. To say “yes” to my children and grandchildren rather than work. I can’t change my routine overnight, but I’m consciously trying to shape the legacy Iwantto leave behind. Here’s what happened to lead me to this new intentionality.When the world went on lockdown over a year ago, I was writing a new book, the 27th one in my career. My stories are family sagas set against the backdrop of nature. For this book, with all of us locked in place, I sought to explore the global phenomenon we were living in through the story line of my characters. This wasn’t so much about COVID-19 but instead about the family dynamics. The roller-coaster experience of the pandemic and writing led my characters (and me) through the five stages of grief—denial, anger, bargaining, depression and acceptance.Over that year like no other, the theme of legacy emerged from the pages of the story. While I explored that topic from each character’s perspective, I found myself examining the theme of legacy in my own life, as well. Before the global shutdown, I had been working at a breathless pace, with little time for the things that mattered most to me, which is making memories with my children and grandchildren. When the shutdown was announced, my book tour was cancelled, I couldn’t travel, and I found myself at home with hours to focus on personal choices. It was a scary time, full of confusion and questions. We learned to zig and to zag. When the dust settled a year later, I had the benefit of hindsight to consider how I wanted to move forward as we slowly return to a new normal.The key question I asked myself was, how did I want to spend my precious time in the upcoming years? Not merely in my career, but more in my role as a wife, mother, grandmother, sister, aunt, and friend. Pondering my legacy led to further questions like:What family stories and traditions am I passing down to my loved ones?What memories am I taking the time to create with my grandchildren? What life lessons am I teaching?The legacy I leave my loved ones will ultimately be memories. How I am remembered—kept alive—in the hearts and minds of my family, friends, and readers. I can only create the memories if I see each day as a gift, and I give the gift of my time to them. These things include: Playing board games with grandchildren, especially MonopolyMovie nights with pile-ups of kids, dogs, and popcorn!Turtles on the beach; discovering nests and watching hatchlings scramble to the seaCooking my chocolate chip cookies with my helpersCreating journals with my grands of what we found in the wild Today, my work schedule is demanding, and I know I’ll never reach the bottom of my checklist of to-dos. And that’s okay. I’m training myself to saynomore often to things that don’t positively serve my legacy, so that I may sayyesmore often to my children and grandchildren and friends. Whether it’s video calls or long phone chats or family visits, a dreamed-about mother-daughter getaway—I’m doing it. I’m hungry for more opportunities to share family stories, to witness the miraculous changes occurring—so fast!—in my grandchildren. To pass on family traditions. To live in the present. I know now that the greatest story I’ll ever write is the book of life with my family.Many of us have undergone some kind of transformation in the past year, acquired some kernel of self-knowledge, had an epiphany, or perhaps discovered a new skill or talent we might wish to continue as we move into the new normal. For me, it’s simple. I wake up each morning and choose to believe that each day is a gift. To smile at the rising sun and be grateful that I’m right here, right now. To live fully in the present. And doing so, I have faith that, yes, I am leaving behind a legacy of love and intention for my family.","Every day is a gift.That’s a familiar phrase we’ve all heard or said in some form in our lives.

",26-07-2021,Healthy Summer Smoothies ,"Should I ever forget to set my alarm, I don’t need to worry. The sound of my husband blending his breakfast smoothie is loud enough to wake the dead. I shouldn’t complain, though. Like most Americans, he needs to eat more fresh fruits and vegetables, and a smoothie is a good way to drink a couple servings’ worth, plus get some calcium and protein from the Greek yogurt he adds. And smoothies, especially during the summer, taste so good — all cool, creamy and sweet in such beautifully appetizing colors.But are smoothies really that healthy for you? Or are they just “a sloppy dessert you drink through a straw,” as a testy British writer forThe Guardianput it recently?Smoothies’ roots as a health drink actually go back nearly a century, starting with a 1926 orange juice stand in Los Angeles that sold a frothy sweet-tart drink called the Orange Julius. The blended mix of fresh OJ, milk, powdered egg whites, vanilla and ice was developed by the stand’s owners to be less acidic than straight orange juice for those with a sensitive stomach. The drink soared in popularity by the 1950s and ’60s. And then there was Steve Kuhnau, the original Smoothie King, who was lactose intolerant and in 1970 decided to develop a blended fruit shake as a healthier alternative to the milkshakes he couldn’t have. His first Smoothie King store opened in 1973 and the idea was a hit, eventually becoming a global chain.By the 1990s, the rapidly expanding smoothie industry really began to take off, soaring to a $12 billion worldwide market as of 2019. Still going strong today, recent trends include green smoothies that add antioxidant-rich spinach or kale to the fruit mix, as well as Instagram-worthy smoothie bowls that skip the straw and instead serve a thick smoothie in a bowl, topped with colorful fruit plus nuts or seeds, all eaten with a spoon.But hold on before you get that blender revving, say dietitians. Yes, fresh fruit (and greens) are a good idea, both for their fiber and their vitamins, but if you’re not careful, you could be consuming a calorie bomb of excess sugar and too little protein.Beth Czerwony, a registered dietitian with the Cleveland Clinic’s Center for Human Nutrition, says that the biggest misconception about smoothies is that they’re all super healthy.“They can be, but often mistakes are made that make them less than ideal,” she said in an email.Common mistakes include not including any protein to keep you feeling full longer, and only using juice, not fiber-rich whole fruits, she said. Plus, “people often put in more fruit than is needed and end up with too many calories, causing unintentional weight gain.”Dietitian Katherine Tallmadge, who does nutrition and wellness counseling via her website, personalizednutrition.com, says for older adults living alone who may not be cooking as much, or who are recovering from illness, smoothies can be a helpful way to get enough protein and nutrition.For older women especially, a smoothie made with yogurt can be an easy way to add protein and calcium “to help replenish the muscle and bone mass we lose at a faster rate as we age,” Tallmadge said in an interview. Yogurt also contains probiotics that may help women’s gastrointestinal system, she added.However, Tallmadge is not a fan of the premade smoothies in the refrigerated section of grocery stores, which she says often have too much sugar from juice and not enough fiber from fruit. “The first ingredient listed on the label, which means it’s used in the greatest amount, is almost always apple juice. Even the mango smoothie only has mango as its fourth ingredient, she said.Although Tallmadge occasionally buys a real mango smoothie — made with whole chunks of mango — from a local coffee shop near her house, she admits she doesn’t make smoothies for herself.“I want to sit down and eat and chew my food. I want crunch, different textures, a little salty, a little sweet. When you drink your meal, you don’t get the same psychological satisfaction,” she said.For smoothie lovers, Tallmadge and Czerwony have these important tips:The slower you sip, the better.It’s easy to gulp down a smoothie, but it’s better for your health to take it slow. The stomach takes about 20 minutes to signal the brain that it’s full. When people finish their meal too quickly, they tend not to feel satisfied and are more likely to overeat — raising their risk for obesity, heart disease and other health problems, recent studies show. “Drinking from a straw can make some people consume the smoothie faster,” says Cleveland Clinic dietitian Czerwony. “Maybe reconsider the straw option” and use a spoon instead. Slowly.Don’t skip the protein.Did your breakfast smoothie keep you feeling full until lunch? If not, says Tallmadge, make sure it has enough protein, fiber from fruits and vegetables, and a heart-healthy fat, like a quarter of an avocado or two tablespoons of nut butter. Plain Greek yogurt, because it contains less water, has about twice the protein as regular plain yogurt — 18 grams versus 9 grams in a six-ounce container. If you can’t do dairy, plain soy milk yogurt or unflavored tofu are good substitutes. (Tofu is also a good source of vegetarian calcium.) Nondairy yogurts made from coconut milk or nut milk tend to be much lower in protein (1 to 5 grams), so check their nutrition label.Frozen fruit is your friend.Many smoothie experts recommend using frozen fruit, instead of fresh fruit plus ice, for best smoothie results. Frozen fruit gives a smoothie the ideal cool, thick texture. Using ice, which quickly melts, can dilute the flavor. Plus, if you have overripe fruit you’re trying to use up, cut it into chunks and freeze it to use in smoothies. Frozen overripe bananas are the perfect sweetener, and they add that luscious creamy texture.","Should I ever forget to set my alarm, I don’t need to worry.

135,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/why-men-friends-can-be-as-good-as-girlfriends
",3/9/2021,Why Men Friends Can Be Just as Fabulous as Girlfriends,"One of my first post-divorce acts of freedom involved asking a friend from high school to join me on a three-day work junket to Alaska. A male friend. A married male friend.Driving along Alaska’s windy roads, we blasted country music, talked endlessly about my failed union, indulged our gum-a-holic habit and marveled at the state’s absurdly spectacular glaciers, moose and eagles. Every night, we retired to our separate hotel rooms. I felt free, safe, hopeful about my future and loved for exactly who I was — emotions I had long forgotten. I’ve always been grateful to him for joining me and for his wife for understanding why we both needed the trip.Over my 55 years of life, I’ve accumulated about six close male friends from elementary school, high school, college and work life. These men watched, from afar, as I tackled two very traditional, extremely unhappy marriages. The type of submissive relationships where I never even asked my husband whether I could go on a trip with a male friend. I was trying, desperately in hindsight, to be the perfect wife, rather than simply myself.I believed our societal messages that husbands feel threatened or less masculine if their wives have close male friends. I actually don’t know for sure if my husbands would have minded these friendships because I never even tried to spend time alone with these men, except for a few phone calls a year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, matrimony eventually felt like a jail cell, despite my efforts and love of parenthood.My marriages to men both ended. My male friendships survived. Not one of my male friends ever asked me to give up anything or change who I was.

I’m loyal and faithful. To my close male friends too! It’s one of my best qualities. And I don’t kick any friends — male or female — to the curb just because I’m sharing a bed, or a lifetime, with someone else.","One of my first post-divorce acts of freedom involved asking a friend from high school to join me on a three-day work junket to Alaska. A male friend. A married male friend.Driving along Alaska’s windy roads, we blasted country music, talked endlessly about my failed union, indulged our gum-a-holic habit and marveled at the state’s absurdly spectacular glaciers, moose and eagles. Every night, we retired to our separate hotel rooms. I felt free, safe, hopeful about my future and loved for exactly who I was — emotions I had long forgotten. I’ve always been grateful to him for joining me and for his wife for understanding why we both needed the trip.Over my 55 years of life, I’ve accumulated about six close male friends from elementary school, high school, college and work life. These men watched, from afar, as I tackled two very traditional, extremely unhappy marriages. The type of submissive relationships where I never even asked my husband whether I could go on a trip with a male friend. I was trying, desperately in hindsight, to be the perfect wife, rather than simply myself.I believed our societal messages that husbands feel threatened or less masculine if their wives have close male friends. I actually don’t know for sure if my husbands would have minded these friendships because I never even tried to spend time alone with these men, except for a few phone calls a year. Perhaps unsurprisingly, matrimony eventually felt like a jail cell, despite my efforts and love of parenthood.My marriages to men both ended. My male friendships survived. Not one of my male friends ever asked me to give up anything or change who I was.

",4/10/2021,The Best Shoes for Older Women That Combine Comfort and Style,"Let’s face it: When your feet speak, you damn well better listen. There are few things more crippling—literally—than a raging bout of plantar fasciitis or gout. And for some, bunions dictate not just our footwear fashion but also our everything fashion as we struggle to find clothes we can wear with those “wide-enough” shoes on our feet.Sadly, many older women are now paying the price for having abused their feet for years by shoveling them into high heels with pointy, narrow toe boxes. And those 26 bones, 33 joints and more than 120 muscles, ligaments, tendons and nerves in our tootsies have been screaming their displeasure at us.Gradually, as age wears down our heel pads and we learn words like “hammertoes,” our choices for shoes diminish and trying to find a pair that is reasonably comfortable and at least minimally stylish becomes a frustrating and expensive proposition. Well-made shoes are pricey, but can you really put a dollar sign on the ability to walk in comfort?The good news is that there are lots of new brands on the market that cater to women who would rather not sacrifice comfort for style.Here’s a short list (a mix of both new and old brand names) to get you started. And if you’ve discovered other brands or styles you like, please share them in the comments below.Sandals/Flip-FlopsOOFOS: OOLALA Luxe Sandal, $65Customer reviews sing their praises—loudly.

The company’s philosophy is that we are most beautiful when we are comfortable; no argument with that.The Karenna has gotten the blessing of the American Podiatric Medical Association as a shoe that promotes good foot health. While it may not be the sexiest sandal in your closet, there is an excellent chance it will be the one you slip on most often. It is completely adjustable and has a backstrap, along with a hook and loop closure at both the instep and front strap.ABEO Brigita Sandal, $49The ABEO brand was started by the founders of the Walking Co. shoe stores. ABEO designs shoes with built-in orthotics, which allows them to produce open-toe designs that are actually good for your feet.

",4/10/2021,How This 'Seinfeld' Actor Became a TikTok Queen in Her 80s,"I think I’m funny and smart and original, and I have always believed that people would enjoy what I have to say.Unfortunately, I have never found those people. Not as an actor, not as a writer, not as a storyteller. It’s not that I haven’t accomplished anything: I published a book, I’ve done solo shows on three continents, and I continue to work as a TV actress. But I’ve always yearned for a larger audience. When I did my last solo show in Los Angeles, the tiny theater held 78 seats, which meant that on slow nights I might be performing my little heart out for 30 or 40 people. Not quite what I dreamed of.I dreamed of performing my little heart out at the Shubert Theater in New York for a laughing, crying, cheering crowd of 1,500 people. While waiting to become rich and famous, I still have had a pleasant life, full of enjoyable, creative activities.One of my favorites has been conducting storytelling classes. I get a big kick out of watching writers improve their personal essays as I encourage them to BE VULNERABLE! BE HONEST! BE AUTHENTIC! Actress Annie Korzen, left, and her friend Mackenzie Morrison. Morrison helped Korzen gain an online presence.Ari Michelson (Hair & Make Up Styling: Juanita Lyon using Oribe for Celestine Agency) These classes have been an opportunity to connect with some very loyal and affectionate young people. Enter Mackenzie. Mackenzie is 30, tall, thin, model-beautiful and a churchgoing Christian. I am 82, short, average-looking and a secular Jew. We are the world’s oddest couple.One day she said to me, “You should be on TikTok.”“Are you nuts? TikTok is about half-naked young girls shaking their booties. Why would anyone be interested in me?”“Trust me, you would blow up.”(“Blow up” is young-people-speak for “get a lot of attention.”)Mackenzie volunteered to be my producer. She would film the clips, edit them, add the music and post them. That was an offer I couldn’t refuse, since I can barely take a selfie. And so it began. I spoke about dating. I spoke about marriage. I spoke about fashion and my dislike of labels. I told stories about celebrities I had known. I showed treasures I had found at yard sales and thrift stores. I discussed the challenge and the bliss of having a Black grandchild. And — lo and behold — people started listening. All kinds of people. I always thought my core audience was middle-aged and older women — mostly Jewish. That turns out not to be the case. I began getting adulating comments from young singles, religious Christians and proud Zulus. “Preach, Queen!” “You should run the world!” “Greetings from Iceland.” “We love you in Scotland!” “You are my favorite TikTokker!” “I love your wisdom!”I am sorry to report, however, that not everybody loves me. This being social media, there are also, of course, the haters. For example, I raised a lot of hackles when I compared Los Angeles — where I live — unfavorably with New York — where I’m from. I got many angry comments of the “Well, move the f--- back if you love it so much!” variety. How nasty! I am old enough and old-fashioned enough to be appalled at the lack of civility in today’s discourse.What those haters don’t understand, of course, is that just because I complain about Los Angeles doesn’t mean I don’t like my life here. I’m a New Yorker. We view complaining as a competitive sport. I complain about my country, but I still love my country. I complain about my husband, but I still love my husband. There are people who, when you ask them how they are, they respond, “Oh, you know, can’t complain.” I am not one of those people.Haters aside, my TikTok success has been a colossal surprise to me, and it remains incomprehensible. I now have over TWO MILLION “LIKES!”But the most astonishing response I’ve gotten from my fans is that they keep telling me I’m beautiful. This is not something I am used to hearing. If a casting call came out for an “attractive older woman,” I guarantee you I would not be seen. I am not Hollywood’s idea of attractive. I’m too “ethnic” — which is a show-biz euphemism for Jewish-looking. But after a lifetime of knowing that I’m not pretty, suddenly people are telling me that I am. Annie in her kitchen with her dollar store finds.Ari Michelson (Hair & Make Up Styling: Juanita Lyon using Oribe for Celestine Agency) Maybe it means that younger people are seeing beyond the conventional idea of beauty that I grew up with. And that's encouraging, isn't it? There are TikTokkers with much larger followings than I have, but they are all much younger. The fact that a woman in her 80s has received this much attention is miraculous.When I asked Mackenzie to explain it, she said, “People respond to you because you are Vulnerable, and Honest, and Authentic.""

",18-10-2021,Eight Ways to Give Your Marriage Nine Lives ,"It’s tough to listen to your mom’s advice stemming from her own love life when you are in a committed relationship she may not approve of. But now that I am in my 34th year of marriage, I embrace the wisdom of my elders who have managed to stay partnered for a decade or three longer than me.These savvy and resilient wives in your family and friend circles can help you navigate one of the toughest journeys of all — living with one partner, under one roof, until death do you part.Here is a distillation of the secrets and strategies I have learned from my elders, and from the hundreds of women I have interviewed for my marriage books, about what it really takes to make a relationship go,from the honeymoon through the golden years:1. It’s okay, even healthy, to have secrets.It’s your relationship, not anyone else’s, and there is no gold-standard marriage. Everyone has issues, problems, and,most important, their own secrets, so don’t worry that your marriage isn’t measuring up. No one knows what’s really going on in a marriage except the two people in it. That gives each of us the freedom to write our own rules and keep our own secrets.2. You don’t get it all in one place.Staying married takes bold creativity, and a variety of sideline activities that fulfill YOU. If you depend on one person in one house to sustain you until death do you part,that’s a ticket to divorce. A marriage that runs on multiple tracks makes for a happier wife who gets to have it both ways — a committed marriage and adventures in uncharted territory.3. Resurrect childhood passions.Those hobbies and sports you loved to do, and excelled at, as a child bring raw primal energy and invigorated self-esteem. Take up surfing again, become a potter, get back on a horse, return to school. Too often those childhood hobbies got left behind as we sat on benches and watched our children race around playing fields and star in plays. Getting back out there yourself and re-engaging with the best of the old brings on a re-birth of youthful optimism and vigor.4. Hang out with outrageous girlfriends.The wives with the highest marital satisfaction have a tight circle of wild and warm women friends with whom to dish, travel and vent. With women in their early 90s comprising the fastest-growing segment of the aging population, and with many marriages lasting more than 50 years, we’re going to need all the laughs and support we can get! Our girlfriends, ever-forgiving and empathetic, provide the escape hatch from the inevitable storms and stand-offs that come with long marriages.5. Take separate vacations — or summers.You like to camp and your partner likes to golf? Spend a month in the Adirondacks while they go with buddies to the splendid courses in Scottsdale or,better yet, Scotland. After some weeks apart from each other, removed from the grind of ordinary life, marriage seems way hotter than the tepid state in which you left your relationship behind. Couples who allow each other to grow separately are the ones with the best chance of growing together and staying together. The old adage is true: Absence does make the heart grow fonder.6. Lower your expectations.It’s a dangerous fantasy to think marriage really means happily-ever-after. Expecting perfection in a marriage or a mate is a sure-fire path to anger and frustration. We cannot fundamentally change our imperfect partners; what we can change is our attitudes about what we are willing to adapt to — and tolerate. Of course, some marriages in which there is abuse or abandonment do need to end. But I too often hear during interviews that a spouse wants to leave a marriage because “I am bored.” Boredom is not a reason to split. Boredom means you need to find new purpose and passion in your own life so you are not boring to yourself. Marital bliss is possible if each partner has blissful outlets apart from the other.7. Be grateful.Remember to thank the confident and flexible spouse who allows you to have an independent and fulfilling life beyond your marriage. Don’t try to win every fight; give in, surrender and say “I’m sorry” (even if you’re not sorry one bit). Holding onto snarly anger forms toxic wedges over time. Demonstrating ongoing vulnerability and compassion definitely makes spouses behave better. And, the ability to bounce back from strife and arguments is the real secret that turns a dark day into a new day in marriage — one that can turn into decades.8. Remember to talk and touch.Your sex life is your own business,though here is what long-marrieds often tell me about sustaining intimacy: In between wifely gallivants and self-exploration, remember to love the spouse you are with — kiss him or her hello and goodbye, and make time for cuddles and hugs and conversation, no matter how crammed your schedules are. Couples who aren’t touching often aren’t talking,and that can make for a very lonely and fragile partnership. So, remember to show ongoing affection for these people who are your loyal history holders, for better and for worse., and often the co-creators of your children. Yes, though the roaring bonfire of early romance does not last, there is real power and comfort in the pilot light of a lengthy union — that never goes out.","It’s tough to listen to your mom’s advice stemming from her own love life when you are in a committed relationship she may not approve of. But now that I am in my 34th year of marriage, I embrace the wisdom of my elders who have managed to stay partnered for a decade or three longer than me.These savvy and resilient wives in your family and friend circles can help you navigate one of the toughest journeys of all — living with one partner, under one roof, until death do you part.Here is a distillation of the secrets and strategies I have learned from my elders, and from the hundreds of women I have interviewed for my marriage books, about what it really takes to make a relationship go,from the honeymoon through the golden years:1. It’s okay, even healthy, to have secrets.It’s your relationship, not anyone else’s, and there is no gold-standard marriage. Everyone has issues, problems, and,most important, their own secrets, so don’t worry that your marriage isn’t measuring up. No one knows what’s really going on in a marriage except the two people in it. That gives each of us the freedom to write our own rules and keep our own secrets.2. You don’t get it all in one place.Staying married takes bold creativity, and a variety of sideline activities that fulfill YOU. If you depend on one person in one house to sustain you until death do you part,that’s a ticket to divorce. A marriage that runs on multiple tracks makes for a happier wife who gets to have it both ways — a committed marriage and adventures in uncharted territory.3. Resurrect childhood passions.Those hobbies and sports you loved to do, and excelled at, as a child bring raw primal energy and invigorated self-esteem. Take up surfing again, become a potter, get back on a horse, return to school. Too often those childhood hobbies got left behind as we sat on benches and watched our children race around playing fields and star in plays. Getting back out there yourself and re-engaging with the best of the old brings on a re-birth of youthful optimism and vigor.4. Hang out with outrageous girlfriends.The wives with the highest marital satisfaction have a tight circle of wild and warm women friends with whom to dish, travel and vent. With women in their early 90s comprising the fastest-growing segment of the aging population, and with many marriages lasting more than 50 years, we’re going to need all the laughs and support we can get! Our girlfriends, ever-forgiving and empathetic, provide the escape hatch from the inevitable storms and stand-offs that come with long marriages.5. Take separate vacations — or summers.You like to camp and your partner likes to golf? Spend a month in the Adirondacks while they go with buddies to the splendid courses in Scottsdale or,better yet, Scotland. After some weeks apart from each other, removed from the grind of ordinary life, marriage seems way hotter than the tepid state in which you left your relationship behind. Couples who allow each other to grow separately are the ones with the best chance of growing together and staying together.

",15-11-2021,Is This the Secret to a Better Marriage?,"After more than 60 years of marriage, my husband and I live separately. We sold our house at the edge of the sea, where afternoons we sat in Adirondack chairs and watched waves gather strength, curl and hurl themselves against rocks. Before this move, I peeled away chairs, desks, tables, beds, bureaus, rugs, photographs, artwork, glassware, dishes.Gone: my mother-in-law’s 100-year-old Renaissance oak dining table where the family gathered for birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgiving and Passover. Gone: the house where the grandchildren spent summers. Gone: the land that held my mother’s and my father’s ashes. Gone: the place that held our one history — we all have our own apartments.I came of age in the 1950s, and after I married, my identity was Mrs. Richard F. Morse Jr. My job description included raising our three sons, preparing our meals, entertaining Dick’s business associates and sitting at his side during “important” dinners. I’d chosen a strong and powerful mate, thinking, perhaps unconsciously, that his independence and place in the world would transfer to me.From the beginning I felt locked in, confused and constrained. I longed for the independent life I didn’t live.Constant motion was my answer — working, jogging, cooking, baking, hiking, skiing. Sometimes, though, I sank down into the malaise inside of me. I spent whole Saturdays in bed and stared at the ceiling. Was I happy? Unhappy? Was it my marriage? Was it me?I had no words.The Feminine Mystiquehadn’t reached me yet. Then, at 39, I matriculated at Dartmouth College and earned a master of arts in liberal studies degree. Paula, my roommate, piled books on my desk:Daughter of Earth,Silences,Of Woman Born.She’d taken classes in a new discipline: women’s studies. I thought about my life as a woman — what I’d lost when I married at 21, what I’d endured as a young wife, deferring to my husband’s wishes and tastes. Yet, I was the engine of our family, planning parties and celebrations, soothing tears and bandaging skinned knees. I was helper and healer. I was never alone, not even in my thoughts. My job was the care of others.That August when I returned home, Dick and the boys took on a few more household chores. They scrubbed pots and swept the kitchen floor. Dark winter Saturday mornings, Dick served the boys pancakes and drove them to ski races while I turned over in bed.I wish I could say that kindness and cooperation were the DNA of our marriage. We were kind, but too often we weren’t. We fought bitterly and repeatedly about Dick’s addiction to cigarettes. Perhaps, though, his smoking was a metaphor for a deeper fissure. Dick was funny and kind, though he was also a my-way-or-the-highway kind of guy.He gaslighted me. “I’m not smoking; I don’t know what you’re smelling.”Slowly, the glue that had held us together flaked. I lost my hiking buddy, my skiing buddy, my walking partner. Sex waned, then disappeared. Dick leaned heavily on a banister to climb stairs. He fought for breath. He stopped walking except to his car. He no longer had the stamina to travel or to visit a museum. He no longer read, not even his John Grisham books. He watched TV. He stared into space.I wondered about the man I married. Did I know him? Had I ever known him?All he wanted, he said, was for me to be nice to him. Being nice meant hands off his habit.So what if I leave my dirty napkins and balled-up, snot-filled handkerchiefs for you to pick up? So what if I don’t follow my doctor’s instructions? I’m fine; my memory’s fine; I walk fine.I’d cared for him after three pulmonary embolisms and open-heart surgery. I’d begged him to give up cigarettes, to exercise and to stop chowing down on McDonald’s hamburgers and shakes. “You’re at me,” he said. “You’re always at me.”Before we left the house by the sea, I’d returned to a place I thought I’d left forever, behavior of the early tumultuous years of our marriage, when I screamed and smashed plates to the floor. One night, as I swept up the shards of a coffee mug, I realized I’d reached the moment when staying was more difficult than leaving.Divorce wasn’t an option. Dick and I had grown up together. We’d created a family, and we cared deeply for that family. Despite our troubles, we loved each other.From the pocket-sized deck of my condo, where I live with Zeus, my 9-year-old standard poodle, my view is now a house with a rusted-out soffit and peeling paint. A “For rent” sign hangs from a doorjamb. Thick black cables hammock from utility pole to utility pole. A far cry from my seascape; yet I am content.Dick lives in a retirement community nearby, where he smokes in his apartment. We meet for lunch and dinner each week. We celebrate holidays, birthdays, our anniversary. One recent summer evening, Dick sat on the deck and sipped a Scotch on the rocks. “We get along better this way,” he said.“Yes, we do,” I answered.","After more than 60 years of marriage, my husband and I live separately.

",1/11/2021,"What I Learned From My Experience as a Playboy Bunny 
","I was 19 years old on January 11, 1963, when I spotted an ad in theNew York Times: Girls! Step into the spotlight! Be a Playboy Bunny!” I had just arrived in New York, fresh from Robbinsdale, Minnesota, with a scholarship to study acting, but I needed a bread-and-butter job.Wearing a dance leotard under my winter coat, I joined throngs of Bunny hopefuls waiting to audition. I was hired after an interview with Keith Hefner, Hugh’s brother, fitted with a pink satin costume and sent to Bunny training with another new recruit — Gloria Steinem, an undercover reporter posing as “Bunny Marie” to write an exposé of the Playboy Club. We memorized our Bunny manuals, practiced the Bunny dip and got to know each other over supper together. So, I was stunned when I read her article in the April and May 1963 issues ofShowmagazine, in which she disparaged our workplace and the women with whom we worked.My experience as a Bunny differed greatly. The Bunny dressing room, where we zipped ourselves into the iconic jewel-colored costumes and glammed up, was a magical place. Bunnies came in every size and shape, and with greater ethnic and racial diversity than you’d find on college campuses for decades to come. We considered ourselves in the vanguard of the Women’s Lib movement, learning to stand up for ourselves and fend off advances with the club’s strict “look but don’t touch” policy. My friends working as temp secretaries couldn’t get away with saying, “Please, sir, don’t touch the typist!”The hourly minimum wage was $1.35, but we could earn $200 in cash tips on a Saturday night. At a time when young single women had to get their fathers to cosign for credit cards, I learned from savvy Bunnies how to acquire credit on my own. Courtesy of the author The clubs all closed 35 years ago, but this past July I joined 250 former Bunnies in Chicago to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the opening of the first Playboy Club. Many spoke about the positive impact that working as a Bunny had on their lives, giving them confidence that they could accomplish anything. With their earnings, they attended college, launched careers and started their own businesses.Susan Santarpia, 56, took a Bunny job at the Buffalo club “on a dare” at age 18. As she recalled, “I felt so empowered earning more than my father and brother. Working as a Bunny established my sense of self and I discovered who I was.” Today, she’s a clinical neuropsychologist, therapist and family court mediator.British-born Ann Lawrence was touring America with a girlfriend in 1962. After checking luggage at a Greyhound Bus depot in New Orleans, they took a stroll down Bourbon Street and impulsively applied to be Bunnies at the newly openedPlayboy Club. Now 83-years-old, the one-time skydiver, who worked in public relations and operated gift shops, says she wasn’t surprised to find that so many former Bunnies at the reunion are successful entrepreneurs, CEOs and leaders in their fields. As Lawrence puts it: “We were an adventurous lot, game to take on anything!”Margaret Rogers, 72, was a “freewheeling hippie in San Francisco,” who returned to her native Baltimore and worked at the Playboy Club there for a year. With her Bunny earnings, she got her bachelor’s degree as a registered nurse, became a freelance writer and worked as a journalist in Cuba for a decade.Mieko Nakamura, 75, worked in the Denver and Jamaica clubs and felt so empowered as a woman that the 4-foot-8-inch Japanese-American took up martial arts to “kick butt.” She then launched a martial arts school called “Lady Dragon.”Peggy Crosby, widow of actor Jack Klugman, was the first Bunny hired at the Atlanta club in 1965 and went on to launch a theatrical career.Rose Adams, 58, worked at the Lansing, Michigan, club, earned a degree in criminal justice and worked in a youth assistance program. Malissa Belt, 72, a professional dancer and Bunny in the Kansas City club, left to open her own dance studio, where she’s taught for over 50 years.I turned in my Bunny ears in 1966 after I joined the cast of a new soap opera,Dark Shadows. When I called to tell my mom, she urged caution: “Better hang on to your Bunny job until you know the show will take off.” Fifty-five years later, all 1,225 episodes are still streaming.I will always remember my Bunny years as fun and glamorous — imagine seeing the Beatles in the club one night! I formed lifelong friendships, gained confidence supporting myself as an independent woman and used my Bunny savings to take low-paying jobs in theater to learn my craft. Courtesy of the author Today, I’m still a working actress, author and freelance writer. I interviewed over 200 former Bunnies for my book,The Bunny Years, including Lauren Hutton, Susan Sullivan and Debbie Harry, who, like me, considered Playboy clubs a launching pad to fund their dreams and become the women they knew they could be.","I was 19 years old on January 11, 1963, when I spotted an ad in theNew York Times: Girls!

",22-11-2021,The Power of Thankfulness Well Beyond Thanksgiving ,"Pre-pandemic, any words that evoked feelings of gratitude and thankfulness were the “it” words trending on social media and in real life. Women of all ages were thankful for foam latte hearts, girlfriend getaways and family vacations.On Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, hashtags called out the highly filtered things the poster was thankful for by using #gratitude, #grateful, #thankfulness and #blessed.Of course, it’s easy to be thankful when everything is going well. But when there’s work, parenting, stress, special needs, COVID-19, health issues, global unrest and a raging pandemic, it’s not so easy. Starting a gratitude practice may fall on the long list of abandoned New Year’s resolutions, alongside working out, dieting and a break from wine.We want to start preparing for Christmas reunions with loved ones, then we remember travel restrictions already in place for the holidays. New England’s leaves haven’t even started changing and already we may be looking at another season of outdoor dining during the bracing Northeast winter.Yet with the return of pumpkin spice, Halloween and countdowns to the December holidays, it’s inevitable that we find ourselves thinking of thankfulness as the days grow shorter and we prepare to celebrate the most delicious food of the year, no matter how sparsely populated our dinner tables might be.Disclaimer: I acknowledge the dark, fraught history of the original Thanksgiving holiday, and we should all work toward reparations just as diligently as we seek the perfect stuffing recipe.As history, including my own, tells us, it’s the darkest days — the ones that feel the most hopeless — that sharpen our need to focus instead on what we have in our lives that deserves thankfulness.When my twins were still in the single digits, I was battling new-parent anxiety, a full-time job and a child with unexpected medical issues. The layered effects of the relentless stress morphed into what I realized was a daily catastrophizing practice. My involuntary addiction to the “what-ifs” turned them into the worst-case scenarios, so that even when I woke up to bright sunshine, things were dark inside, dawn until dusk.One day when I didn’t recognize this glass-half-empty gal and I felt like a stranger to myself, I remembered living in New York City in my own apartment, working my dream job in publishing. Every single day I felt like I was unwrapping a beautiful gift. This memory flooded me with nostalgia and hope, because I knew in that moment, surely, that I could find a single “gift,” big or small. It was then that I committed to finding a gift for 365 consecutive days.Today, more than a decade later, it’s day 4,195 and I’m devoted to my daily gratitude practice more than ever. I’m here to tell you it’s good (great) to give thanks well beyond Thanksgiving. Thankfulness is my secret to living a happy life despite the stress of everything from parenting to a pandemic. So don’t save your gratitude for Thanksgiving Day or for the December holidays — or you will miss out on so many daily gifts. I know, I know. People are tired. Parents, grandparents, kids. Teachers, lawyers, accountants. We have baked, organized, donated, exercised, binged all the shows and read all the books.And we often feel like we are DONE. But we can we bring real mindfulness to overused hashtags and filtered photos so that they mean something and deepen our lives and community connections.On the dawn of Thanksgiving, being grateful for what is richly ours — family, food, friends — allows us to breathe deeply and savor this moment, and to not stress over what we imagine is to come. Mirroring my own stress-reducing experiences writing in gratitude journals and blogging are many scientific studies showing how gratitude boosts mind and body health. Take a 2018 Positive Psychology report, “The Science of Gratitude,” which revealed many benefits, including increased self-esteem, improved relationships and even reduced blood pressure! In 2016,Inc.magazine ran a piece titled “Gratitude Physically Changes Your Brain” about an Indiana University study concluding that “practicing gratitude seems to kick off a healthful, self-perpetuating cycle in your brain” — real scientific proof that committing to a gratitude practice can actually change our brain.I’m convinced this happened to me. I was interviewed about my three-year-old gratitude experience in the June 2013 issue of the now defunctMoremagazine. In “Change One Habit, Change Your Life,” written by Brian Alexander, I explained how I started a gratitude blog to help me change my habit of catastrophizing about the unknown and uncertainty surrounding my son’s special needs.I am living proof of the gifts of having a gratitude attitude. Finding a daily gift to be thankful for has healed my life. With awe, 11 years later, these benefits remain today. HappinessIncreased positive moodLess materialisticLess burnoutBetter physical and mental healthBetter sleep With a refrigerator filled with food for my family’s Thanksgiving table, I am newly grateful — and aware of — the simple things we often take for granted: a delicious meal, hugs from kids, our health. Long after your green bean casserole has been devoured and your adult children have gone back to college or to their own families, being thankful, fueled by love and hope, is what really keeps us going.","Pre-pandemic, any words that evoked feelings of gratitude and thankfulness were the “it” words trending on social media and in real life.

New England’s leaves haven’t even started changing and already we may be looking at another season of outdoor dining during the bracing Northeast winter.Yet with the return of pumpkin spice, Halloween and countdowns to the December holidays, it’s inevitable that we find ourselves thinking of thankfulness as the days grow shorter and we prepare to celebrate the most delicious food of the year, no matter how sparsely populated our dinner tables might be.Disclaimer: I acknowledge the dark, fraught history of the original Thanksgiving holiday, and we should all work toward reparations just as diligently as we seek the perfect stuffing recipe.As history, including my own, tells us, it’s the darkest days — the ones that feel the most hopeless — that sharpen our need to focus instead on what we have in our lives that deserves thankfulness.When my twins were still in the single digits, I was battling new-parent anxiety, a full-time job and a child with unexpected medical issues. The layered effects of the relentless stress morphed into what I realized was a daily catastrophizing practice. My involuntary addiction to the “what-ifs” turned them into the worst-case scenarios, so that even when I woke up to bright sunshine, things were dark inside, dawn until dusk.One day when I didn’t recognize this glass-half-empty gal and I felt like a stranger to myself, I remembered living in New York City in my own apartment, working my dream job in publishing. Every single day I felt like I was unwrapping a beautiful gift. This memory flooded me with nostalgia and hope, because I knew in that moment, surely, that I could find a single “gift,” big or small. It was then that I committed to finding a gift for 365 consecutive days.Today, more than a decade later, it’s day 4,195 and I’m devoted to my daily gratitude practice more than ever. I’m here to tell you it’s good (great) to give thanks well beyond Thanksgiving. Thankfulness is my secret to living a happy life despite the stress of everything from parenting to a pandemic. So don’t save your gratitude for Thanksgiving Day or for the December holidays — or you will miss out on so many daily gifts. I know, I know. People are tired. Parents, grandparents, kids. Teachers, lawyers, accountants. We have baked, organized, donated, exercised, binged all the shows and read all the books.And we often feel like we are DONE. But we can we bring real mindfulness to overused hashtags and filtered photos so that they mean something and deepen our lives and community connections.On the dawn of Thanksgiving, being grateful for what is richly ours — family, food, friends — allows us to breathe deeply and savor this moment, and to not stress over what we imagine is to come. Mirroring my own stress-reducing experiences writing in gratitude journals and blogging are many scientific studies showing how gratitude boosts mind and body health. Take a 2018 Positive Psychology report, “The Science of Gratitude,” which revealed many benefits, including increased self-esteem, improved relationships and even reduced blood pressure! In 2016,Inc.magazine ran a piece titled “Gratitude Physically Changes Your Brain” about an Indiana University study concluding that “practicing gratitude seems to kick off a healthful, self-perpetuating cycle in your brain” — real scientific proof that committing to a gratitude practice can actually change our brain.I’m convinced this happened to me. I was interviewed about my three-year-old gratitude experience in the June 2013 issue of the now defunctMoremagazine. In “Change One Habit, Change Your Life,” written by Brian Alexander, I explained how I started a gratitude blog to help me change my habit of catastrophizing about the unknown and uncertainty surrounding my son’s special needs.I am living proof of the gifts of having a gratitude attitude. Finding a daily gift to be thankful for has healed my life. With awe, 11 years later, these benefits remain today. HappinessIncreased positive moodLess materialisticLess burnoutBetter physical and mental healthBetter sleep With a refrigerator filled with food for my family’s Thanksgiving table, I am newly grateful — and aware of — the simple things we often take for granted: a delicious meal, hugs from kids, our health. Long after your green bean casserole has been devoured and your adult children have gone back to college or to their own families, being thankful, fueled by love and hope, is what really keeps us going."

",3/1/2022,"Books My Mother Loved – and You Will Love, Too","My mother was a reader. She’d get lost in a story, in her thoughts. It was something she did for herself, in solitude.My sisters and I all remember her reading at the kitchen table. And there were always books on her nightstand, so presumably she also read in bed. Though with our early childhood bedtimes, this isn’t anything we would have witnessed.My own love of reading, which went on to inspire my career as an interviewer of authors in broadcast and live events, is directly passed down by my mother. My rule about never going anywhere without a book is also a credit to my mother’s modeling.Her love of reading began early in her childhood, growing up in Amityville, Long Island. She would share stories of how she’d sit below a tree with her beloved Nancy Drew or Cherry Ames. These old books I have found would have my mother’s beautiful signature in them, leaving no doubt as to who the proud owner was. Signing her books was a tradition she carried forward with her into her adult collection, as well. The dozens of books in my childhood home would line shelves in a way that was as comforting as our family photos. I would sometimes sit mesmerized, taking in the way the spines morphed into a piece of artwork.The books I selected below as a representation of my mom’s literary taste span the late ’60s and ’70s, and a few from the ’90s that I enjoyed reading as well.Erma Bombeck,When You Look Like Your Passport Photo—It’s Time to Go HomeThis book is filled with humor and heart. Anything from Erma is always a thoughtful and hilarious read. These short stories revolved around travel, and they are so relatable you’d think Erma was standing over your shoulder, watching you pack up for your own adventure.Judith Krantz,ScruplesKrantz was the queen of her genre and made publishing history with her fast-paced soap-opera-like story about Billy and her rise to Rodeo royalty. Sex, revenge and scandal. This book has it all!Sue Kaufman,Falling BodiesFrom the author who brought usDiary Of A Mad Housewifeand for fans of Jennifer Weiner comes a story about family that’s both disturbing and funny—as the best books are.Daphne du Maurier,Don’t Look NowThis is a collection of five short stories that contain mystery, horror, grief and a cast of characters that will remain imprinted in your memory.James Brough,We Were Five: The Dionne Quintuplets’ StoryThe Dionne sisters were born in Canada in 1934 and had the distinction of being the world’s first surviving quintuplets. When they were just days old, their father offered the babies to the Chicago World’s Fair as an exhibit. The Canadian government was horrified and made them wards of the Crown. The father regained control of the children seven years later and made their home a profitable tourist attraction.I was so moved by this story that I went down the proverbial rabbit hole and learned that there are two remaining sisters and that they celebrated their 87th birthday this past May.Silvia Tennenbaum,Rachel, the Rabbi’s WifeSet in suburbia over the course of a year, this family drama includes Rachel, her husband the rabbi and their son. Incredibly frustrated with dreams of her own, Rachel finds satisfaction in the New York art world. Despite the Long Island clichés, I’d say this complex book holds up.Wally Lamb,She’s Come UndoneIf you haven’t had a chance to read this one, you are in for a treat. Lamb’s coming-of-age debut novel is unforgettable and was also an early Oprah pick. I read this book almost 30 years ago and vividly recall the heroine, Delores Price, her pain, humor and hopefulness.David Guterson,Snow Falling on CedarsThis beautiful and haunting story follows the trial of Kabuo Miyamoto, a Japanese American who is accused of murder when a local fisherman is found drowned. Of the hundreds of books I have read, this has got to be one of the most heart wrenching, poignant and tragic stories ever told.  If you want to get to know a person, take a look at his or her bookshelves or nightstand.The books my mother loved were thought-provoking, funny, relatable and a bit disconcerting with complicated characters. I am so connected to my mother’s taste in books that I am confident that—if I were lucky enough to still be chatting with her—there are some new books she’d be enjoying today, like these two picks.Sally Hepworth,The Mother-in-LawA book filled with family secrets, twists, turns and a mother-in-law who winds up dead under suspicious conditions. Classic Hepworth.Adrienne Brodeur,Wild GameThis is one of the most engrossing memoirs I have ever read, chronicling relationships gone amuck, and a mother-daughter duo you will never forget. This book is filled with passion, food and lots of heart.I often think about how my mother would love that I created a talk radio show in which I speak to my favorite authors weekly. She would love that I have interviewed thousands of authors, online and in live events, during these past 19 years. Every time I sit down with a book, it’s as if we’re sitting together, lost in the story.The cozy winter reading season is upon us. I hope you get a chance during the holidays to snuggle up with some of these books loved by my mom and me.","My mother was a reader. She’d get lost in a story, in her thoughts.

",29-11-2021,When My Ex Turns 80 I Will Be by His Side,"When I met Bruce, in 1983, I never thought any man would consider me attractive, let alone want to spend his life with me. I was recovering from having literally been on fire, caused by a flame attaching itself to my sleeve while removing a kettle from the stove. After years of skin grafts, a stint in the burn unit and physical therapy, I was ready, at 33, to rebuild my life.Ten years my senior, Bruce didn’t find my scars grotesque, as I did, and told me I was beautiful. I fell in love. As a painter with a circle of artistic friends, I was the answer to this triathlete corporate salesman’s midlife crisis. I was his Porsche, providing thevroomof the new experiences he craved. Bruce was my loving cheering squad, boosting my confidence, always having my back.We married in 1984 and were happy for 18 years until we were miserable together. I had grown stronger, and he had lost focus. We divorced when our son was 9 and didn’t speak for 10 years — until I urged him to be a paternal role model. I wanted him to encourage our son’s participation in marathons and other athletics and steer him away from hanging with kids who were on self-destructive paths. We became cohorts. We never discussed our love or sex lives with other people. I don’t think we wanted to know.I grew to realize that the thing about Bruce that never changed was his unfailing loyalty when he was needed by friends and family, especially by me. Six months before COVID-19 hit hard, I fell and broke my neck.Alone, in agony on my floor, I called him, then 911. After I had successful spinal fusion surgery, he showed up, took care of me and never left. Retaining his own apartment, he stayed at my home most of the time. The lockdown gave our new togetherness a giant nudge. Now that I'm recovered, we have been inseparable for two years. We spend most of our nights together, usually consider ourselves a “we,” sometimes romantic. No man has come as close as he does to feeling like family. I am open with this man when I normally filter around other people. It’s a relief to be able to breathe out fully with a person.The baseline is that we’re there for each other. It’s a wonderful situation to have and I’m grateful. The only downside is that sometimes I still see the reason I divorced him — money slips through his fingers. I’ve learned that my expectations are not always his reality and that his generosity shines in other ways. This time around, because we’re not legally bound, in the tension is where we grow and find flexibility and acceptance, instead of walking out.Our son, now 29, is thrilled to be able to be around both parents again. When he visits, he tells us his favorite thing is hearing us read to each other from the other room.Bruce and I don’t define our relationship, but we do make plans. Unlike being married, we don’t discuss the distant future, only the near one. As a big thank you for helping me regain the ability to function again, I told Bruce I wanted to take him on a trip when it was safe to travel in the world, someplace like the Caribbean or to view Iceland’s northern lights.On his 80th birthday last summer, I asked how he would like to commemorate it. “I don’t feel old, and 80 sounds old. I want to forget my birthday this year,” he said.I certainly couldn’t let the occasion go unnoticed. We both believed that birthdays were personal holidays to celebrate.On that day, father and son played Petanque, the French version of bocce, where each player has their own set of steel balls. Playing his sport with our son on his birthday trumped playing with a whole team of well-wishers. I took them to a trendy restaurant with sunset views for dinner, and with those activities, I thought I had the celebration nailed.Recently, he woke me up with a kiss and said, “Can we still do a trip for my birthday? I want to go to Israel and climb Masada. I’ve never been to my Jewish homeland. It’s about time.” Surprised at this declaration, I said, “Sure, but do you really feel comfortable making a long trip now given COVID?  How about in a few months?”Bruce’s blue eyes grew larger and crystalline in a way I hadn’t seen in decades. He’s a history and archaeology buff, so his anticipation of climbing to an isolated rock plateau, where the ancient fortress stood, was palpable.I immediately started researching his birthday trip, including viewing Masada’s glory at sunrise from sea level, and other must-sees, like Tel Aviv.I had spent three months in Israel when I was 20 and stayed on a kibbutz, where I learned to cook, swam through grottos in the sea and traveled the country. My relationship with my ex is as peaceful as the ones that I had when I was younger were tumultuous.Now I look forward to sharing an adventure and celebrating the belated 80th birthday with the only man I married, who is no longer my husband but my best friend. Researched and ready, we’ll be in the air when we feel safe to travel. With age comes patience.","When I met Bruce, in 1983, I never thought any man would consider me attractive, let alone want to spend his life with me.

It’s about time.” Surprised at this declaration, I said, “Sure, but do you really feel comfortable making a long trip now given COVID?  How about in a few months?”Bruce’s blue eyes grew larger and crystalline in a way I hadn’t seen in decades. He’s a history and archaeology buff, so his anticipation of climbing to an isolated rock plateau, where the ancient fortress stood, was palpable.I immediately started researching his birthday trip, including viewing Masada’s glory at sunrise from sea level, and other must-sees, like Tel Aviv.I had spent three months in Israel when I was 20 and stayed on a kibbutz, where I learned to cook, swam through grottos in the sea and traveled the country. My relationship with my ex is as peaceful as the ones that I had when I was younger were tumultuous.Now I look forward to sharing an adventure and celebrating the belated 80th birthday with the only man I married, who is no longer my husband but my best friend. Researched and ready, we’ll be in the air when we feel safe to travel. With age comes patience."

",20-12-2021,Beat Any Blues by Walking Through the Seasons of Life,"Feeling lousy? Take a walk. As a committed walker since I did the 30-mile Hike for Hunger in high school, I do love what this exercise does for the body. Yet what I love most of all is what it does for the psyche and soul.As we end another year plagued by a pandemic and uncertainty, we all have woes that differ in severity. Walking cannot bring back jobs lost or loved ones passing. Yet those brisk jaunts — arms swinging, head held high — unfailingly elevate moods and ease us through the dark tunnels of our lives — and even give us more of that life.According to the Harvard Medical School study “Walking for Health,” this exercise is nothing short of a miracle drug, curing all sorts of ails. ""Walking can have a bigger impact on disease risk and various health conditions than just about any other remedy that’s readily available to you,” says the study. “Walking for 2.5 hours a week — that’s just 21 minutes a day — can cut your risk of heart disease by 30%. In addition, this do-anywhere, no-equipment-required activity has also been shown to reduce the risk of diabetes and cancer, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and keep you mentally sharp.” My mother did not know any of this stuff in the 1960s. All she knew was that swift movement could turn a crabby kid into a happier one.Whenever I had the blues, my mom would say, “Go run around the block” — even in the Chicago winter. And this I did, returning red-faced, breathless and forgetting what had been bringing me down. I am no longer a runner, though I do walk very fast and still return with that feeling I had as a child — spunkier and more hopeful.When we made the choice to move near the Chesapeake Bay and raise our children there, I was impressed with the schools and the intimacy of the community. Another compelling lure was the Baltimore-Annapolis trail, the woodsy spine of splendor that never fails to leave me both sweaty and soothed.I have walked through the many seasons of life, along paths of dirt and snow, and through moods of confusion and sadness and joy. I walked through the illnesses and deaths of my parents and the transition from ebullient newlywed to a mother of four sons with a mortgage.I walked through worrying about the boys’ first days of school to wild teenage parties, and through the lonely sting of an empty nest. I walked through the evisceration of the twin towers and through too many wars. I steadied myself on walks during the roller coaster of a 34-year marriage.On each birthday, I walk for miles, alone, celebrating this day that I am still here, having lived more of life than that left to live. I change with the seasons, as I walk through the sauna of July, the prism of October and in the bluster of January, my face chapped raw, fully alive in the chill. Turns out a full life can last a long time if we keep at it for decades.Reaching the popularized goal of 10,000 steps daily may not be necessary.A comprehensive study published in 2019 in the journalJAMA Internal Medicinethat tracked steps-per-day of 16,741 women with a mean age of 72 years, over a period of a week, concluded with this: “Women who averaged approximately 4,400 steps [per day] had significantly lower mortality rates during a follow-up of 4.3 years compared with the least active women who took approximately 2,700 steps [per day]. As more steps per day were accrued, mortality rates progressively decreased before leveling at approximately 7,500 steps [per day].”This is great news for women like me who walk as their primary exercise and may be daunted by the dictum that we need to reach 10,000 steps or else! Some crammed days when I cannot get out on the trail, I walk up and down my long driveway 20 times and I have no idea how many steps I take. I do know when I get back into my kitchen, I am far more relaxed.That’s the best part of taking a good walk. No matter how old or fit we are, putting on sweats and sneakers and taking a stroll is instantly accessible, as well as therapeutic and mood enhancing. Lots of friends have fancy fitness gear indoors, on which they work their bodies to jelly, as virtual trainers bark out orders. And in the most brutal of weather, I do appreciate my low-tech and unfancy treadmill.Though on most days, in most seasons, there is nothing like getting out of the house, out of our churning brains, and into fresh air and open skies that jolt all of our senses awake. Those of us who are able to take regular walks in the woods feel what Henry David Thoreau realized when he wrote this inWalden:“We need the tonic of the wilderness. We can never have enough of nature.”Giddy and exhausted, having whittled off calories and built up an appetite, my evening walks can end up in my kitchen, with a glass of cabernet and some fatty, gooey cheeses. I devour these goodies with finesse, knowing that the next day I can walk them off.And, so round and round the circle of the seasons go, the shifts in weather and the shifts of mind. Though what never changes is my absolute knowing that when the going gets tough, I can get out there and walk through any tunnels and into the light.This foggy December morning, I walked through a sputtering of cold rain. The shiver I felt was one that brought on a huge smile, and the sense I always get when I am moving swiftly under towering trees — that I am ready for anything.","Feeling lousy? Take a walk.

",4/1/2022,Could a Change in Diet Get Rid of Those Hot Flashes?,"Of the many changes that come with the onset of menopause, hot flashes are among the worst — ambushing women with intense waves of heat and sweating that can disrupt sleep and affect their mood and memory, all thanks to declining estrogen levels.Up to 75 percent of U.S. women in either perimenopause or menopause report experiencing hot flashes. Unfortunately, there are few consistently effective treatments other than hormonal therapy, which comes with its own risks. But what if a change in diet could dramatically reduce those fiery flashes?The results of a new study, published in 2021 in the journalMenopause, suggest that women who follow a low-fat, vegan diet — including having half a cup of cooked soybeans daily — may be able to reduce moderate-to-severe hot flashes by 84 percent. (A vegan diet avoids all animal foods, including dairy and eggs.)Researchers randomly assigned 36 postmenopausal women reporting two or more hot flashes a day to either a low-fat vegan diet with soybeans group, or a control group with no diet changes. At the end of 12 weeks, women in the vegan group had reduced their total hot flashes by 79 percent, while moderate-to-severe flashes were reduced by 84 percent. Nearly 60 percent of the vegan group also reported no longer having any moderate-to-severe flashes.Lead researcher Neal Barnard, M.D., an adjunct professor at the George Washington University School of Medicine and longtime researcher and advocate of the health benefits of a vegan diet,  called the study’s results “a game-changer for women aged 45 and over,” one that offered relief from severe menopause symptoms without having to take any drugs.Barnard, 68, is also founder and president of Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a group of doctors and others that emphasize preventive medicine through nutrition and good health. His research and many books stress the benefits of a vegan diet for help with obesity, diabetes and heart problems.Barnard knows a totally plant-based diet can be a hard sell to life-long carnivores. His own mother, he says, “ignored me for the longest time, until her doctor told her her cholesterol was too high and she needed to start a statin.” After she switched to a plant-based diet for two months, her cholesterol dropped by 80 points. “Her doctor thought the lab had made a mistake.”Barnard tells his patients to try eating only plant-based foods for a week and his clinic helps them come up with breakfast, lunch and dinner ideas. It’s easier now, he says, “because there are so many more vegan foods. There’s vegan sausage, vegan cheese and plant-based milks. I even tell them a bean burrito from Taco Bell (skip the cheese) can work.”We talked to Barnard about his latest research and how eating a more plant-based diet may benefit older women.Q: Your new study found that eating a low-fat, vegan diet that included a daily half-cup of cooked soybeans dramatically decreased the number of hot flashes women were experiencing. Do you think eating a daily portion of cooked soybeans would help menopausal women who were not following a vegan diet?A:We would recommend trying all three parts — low-fat, vegan and a daily half-cup cooked soybeans — and see if the hot flashes back off. In the study, we wanted to get the fastest results to give women relief. Our first goal was to allow them to sleep at night. But women could see if just adding the soybeans to their current diet helps, or just trying the low-fat or vegan part. Try half of the changes and if it works, then it’s OK.Q: Why the additional cooked soybeans to an already plant-based diet? What role do soybeans play in reducing hot flashes?A:Soy contains isoflavones, also known as phytoestrogens, which occur naturally in plants and have estrogen-like properties. In the past, there was worry soy foods could increase the risk for cancer, but research since then has found eating moderate amounts may decrease the risk of some cancers. Phytoestrogens seem to have weaker effects in the body than does the type of estrogen in hormone therapy, which is why other studies have also found eating soy foods is helpful in relieving hot flashes. But, of course, a woman with a history of breast cancer should talk to her doctor before eating more soy.Q: How else does a vegan diet benefit an older woman’s health?A number of women also notice dramatic improvement in vaginal dryness and help with losing weight. In our study about hot flashes, the women in the vegan group also lost eight pounds over the 12-week study. In other studies we’ve done on overweight women following a simple vegan diet — no animal products was the only rule — they lost a pound a week. A vegan diet is also a good way to get blood sugar levels down, which is great for those with diabetes, and it can help reduce cholesterol and blood pressure. In the long run, making this kind of diet change may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s and cognitive impairment because it avoids a lot of the foods linked to higher risk of these brain conditions","Of the many changes that come with the onset of menopause, hot flashes are among the worst — ambushing women with intense waves of heat and sweating that can disrupt sleep and affect their mood and memory, all thanks to declining estrogen levels.Up to 75 percent of U.S. women in either perimenopause or menopause report experiencing hot flashes. Unfortunately, there are few consistently effective treatments other than hormonal therapy, which comes with its own risks.

",10/1/2022,Simple Yoga: 3 Easy Poses to Boost Flexibility and Release Pain,"Becoming more flexible and pain-free sounds like a new year’s goal for all, but it may not always be at the top of your to-do list. Concerns like time and priorities may keep you disconnected from your body. Yet, disconnection itself can lead to even more anxiety, insomnia and stress.I started teaching yoga in 1980 at a very young age in my mother’s gymnastics school in western New York. As a certified yoga teacher since 2009, I run retreats from Maryland to Mexico and Central America. My current company, Celebrate the Pelvic Floor, runs retreats for women, in-person and virtually, from around the world.Through yoga, these women not only have improved their flexibility and released their pain, but also have grown more fit and feisty! There are so many benefits to this practice.According to ancient tradition, connecting mind and body through practice is literally the definition of yoga. And this mind-body connection is always available to you. Your capacity for it is unlimited, as long as you continue to practice.When you allow yourself to relax in a pose, your heart rate lowers as you tap into your parasympathetic nervous system. You’re stimulating blood flow to the targeted area, which then warms and rehydrates your deeper tissues. That hydration allows for movement as you settle into a deeper stretch. And this is the sweet spot where you stay.Here are three easy yoga poses to practice in the privacy of your home to boost your flexibility and release pain.Preparing for your poses: You’ll need approximately 15 minutesKeep a blanket nearby for warmthKeep pillows nearby for comfortTurn on a relaxing playlistTurn off notifications, but keep your cell phone nearby for the timer Important note: Once you arrange your body into each pose, start your timer for three minutes, relax as deeply as you can and simply breathe. Courtesy of author Pose 1: Child’s PoseWhy: It’s the perfect place to start to calm the mind and bring you to a more inward focus. Child’s Pose stretches the back, thighs and pelvic floor and conditions the joints of the ankles, knees and hips.How: Come into All Fours Pose (on hands and knees), move your knees wide and bring your big toes to touch. Drop down to your elbows, hips are high, bend the knees and sink the hips back toward the heels. Rest your forehead on a pillow or your hands. Set your timer, close your eyes, be still and breathe normally and naturally.Modification: If your feet cramp, roll a towel and place it under your ankles. If your knees and/or hips feel super tight, don’t sink back to your heels. Keep your tail pointing high and relax your pelvic floor.Transition: When the timer sounds, return to All-Fours then move into a prone position on the front body. Take a few mindful breaths here before moving on to the next pose. Courtesy of author Pose 2: Resting Half Frog PoseWhy: This pose reduces hip and low back pain, relaxes the muscles of the pelvic floor and helps heighten sexual energy.How: In a prone position, turn your face to the right (resting on your left cheek), move the left arm down to the side, then slide the right bent knee around the right side toward the right elbow, stretching the hip and inner thigh. Set your timer, settle in, rest and breathe gently.Modification: If it doesn’t feel comfortable lying in a prone position, lie on your side then bring a knee up toward the chest.Transition: When the timer sounds, move to the other side for three minutes. After both sides, slither slowly onto your side body in the fetal position. Enjoy a moment of mindfulness here before moving on to the next pose. Courtesy of author Pose 3: Reclining Queen PoseWhy: Because of the name itself! As well as stretching the back and opening the heart, this pose can calm anxiety as it releases tension around the diaphragm for better breathing.How: Arrange a small firm pillow under a larger softer pillow then lie back on both. Legs can lay long — or bring your feet together, bend the knees and open the hips for Butterfly. Open the arms out to the sides, palms up as you breathe deeply and slowly, softening your low belly and perineum on the inhale. Set your timer, smile and be a queen.Modification: If your low back feels unsafe, roll to your side and remove the small firm pillow then return to the pose. And if the pose feels too intense for the hips and/or inner thighs, place two small pillows under the knees.Transition: When the timer sounds, on an exhale, roll slowly onto your side, push up to a seated position, move the pillows to the side and return to your back.Take a moment here — lie still, eyes closed, hands resting near your low belly, fingers pointing toward your pubic bone. Feel the heat of your body, breathe slowly and smile.These poses are powerful work — just keep practicing. Remember your body needs just three minutes in each pose for maximum effect to boost flexibility and release pain. So, find your pose, make any adjustment that needs to be made to be comfortable then simply breathe and be.This is the way to honor you in 2022!","Becoming more flexible and pain-free sounds like a new year’s goal for all, but it may not always be at the top of your to-do list.

",10/1/2022,"Decades Before #MeToo, I Was a Silent Child Victim","As a therapist and a smart, empowered woman of a certain age, I like to think I’ve got my stuff together. Thus, with the emergence of the Me Too movement, I was surprised at my uneasiness with the subject of the cause.With some soul searching and a few vivid dreams, memories of my own Me Too moment surfaced, and the uneasiness was replaced with the knowledge that I had to admit what happened. Though it occurred more than 60 years ago, I recall every detail of the incident with a vividness that is not present in most of my memories. That is to be expected, as memories of trauma present neon-like in our mental file cabinet.I was 9. My mother and I had moved to an apartment in a new city while my father finished selling his business in my hometown. After the school bus dropped me off, I was alone for two hours before my mother came home from her office, at five p.m. It was my job to collect our mail from the mailroom, a small, dank place on the basement level. The mailroom was the realm of Mr. X, as I shall call him, an obese, flushed-face man whose obsequious manner toward the residents was obvious even to me. Nevertheless, he was always quick to hand me our mail, along with some comment about how special I looked.On that particular day, I was wearing my favorite dress, a shirtwaist, with orange ovals patterned on a peach background.When I went to the mailroom counter, Mr. X said, “My, what a pretty dress! Why don’t you come back here into my room? I have something fun to show you.” Never being told anything about the dangers of the world, I accepted. I was used to trusting and obeying adults, even someone of dubious authority like this smelly, ugly man. Mr. X guided me to his chair and sat down, placing me in front of him. He started unbuttoning my dress while I looked, at his direction, at the wall behind him.“What I am doing will make you look like the girls on the calendar when you grow up.”The voluptuous women I saw on the calendar bore no resemblance to my mother or my aunts, the only women I had ever seen in their underwear. Meanwhile, he was massaging my chest and snickering to his two friends who were sitting in the back of the room.I was frozen, silent, not exactly frightened but bewildered. Time stopped, but it must have been only a few moments until he finished. He buttoned my dress and pushed me out of the room, glancing sideways to make sure no one was in sight. “Here’s your mail, little miss. Now you and I have a secret. Don’t tell anyone!” I nodded obediently and hurried upstairs.I thought of a few ways to tell my mother, afraid of upsetting her. But when she came through the door an hour later, I blurted out, “I’m not going to get the mail anymore.”Then I repeated this, shouting: “Did you hear me? I am not going to get the mail anymore!”“That’s fine,” she answered. “We’ll get it together from now on, Iris.”And we did. From then on, my mother and I would get the mail once she was home. Mr. X was still overly complimentary to her, but I felt the smirk on his face. I couldn’t look at him.My mother clearly did not sense the urgent message behind my words. Why didn’t I scream out the details? After my second outburst, I realized, intuitively, that to my mother, there was never any thought of danger in my life.She had spent her childhood in a shtetl in a tiny Russian town. Her family was desperately trying to immigrate to America. Their departure was delayed while her brother minimally recovered from a gunshot wound to his face, courtesy of a local Cossack. Their lives were nothing but trauma, violence and fear. She put all that behind her and became a naturalized citizen and an attorney.To her, my life was safe and secure. What possible peril could lurk in my tony apartment building? I tucked my feelings of confusion and shame inside and realized I had to depend on my own wits to keep me safe.Some therapy in graduate school, and an alarmed and loving response from my soon-to-be husband, helped me begin to process the assault and forgive myself and my mother. Did I ever speak of it again? No, not until recently, when I realized that I needed to define and accept what happened as a sexual assault, serious and criminal in nature. In any crime there is a victim and a perpetrator. There is also a receiver, the first person with whom the victim speaks. This could be a parent, a friend, a spouse or, possibly, a police officer, but whoever it is, their response has the power to mitigate or crush.As a therapist for crime victims, I often had the honor of filling that role. I realize that by truly hearing what victims are saying, I am healing that 9-year-old, cowering in the mailroom. The Me Too movement empowered me to face the past, speak of it and truly heal.My mother died many years after the assault, never knowing it happened or its effects on me. That was my gift to her.","As a therapist and a smart, empowered woman of a certain age, I like to think I’ve got my stuff together. Thus, with the emergence of the Me Too movement, I was surprised at my uneasiness with the subject of the cause.With some soul searching and a few vivid dreams, memories of my own Me Too moment surfaced, and the uneasiness was replaced with the knowledge that I had to admit what happened. Though it occurred more than 60 years ago, I recall every detail of the incident with a vividness that is not present in most of my memories. That is to be expected, as memories of trauma present neon-like in our mental file cabinet.I was 9. My mother and I had moved to an apartment in a new city while my father finished selling his business in my hometown. After the school bus dropped me off, I was alone for two hours before my mother came home from her office, at five p.m. It was my job to collect our mail from the mailroom, a small, dank place on the basement level. The mailroom was the realm of Mr. X, as I shall call him, an obese, flushed-face man whose obsequious manner toward the residents was obvious even to me. Nevertheless, he was always quick to hand me our mail, along with some comment about how special I looked.On that particular day, I was wearing my favorite dress, a shirtwaist, with orange ovals patterned on a peach background.When I went to the mailroom counter, Mr. X said, “My, what a pretty dress!

",24-01-2022,7 New Accessories to Add Pizzazz to Your Oldest Outfits,"The holidays have come and gone. And the snow that seemed exciting when it first fell has lost its appeal. So have the winter clothes in our closets. But don’t wave the white flag and burrow further into your fleece and winter funk. These are the days accessories were meant for, as your pick-me-up. And these are the seven accessory trends that can add style and spark to your wardrobe — no matter how old or new it is. Courtesy of Macy's Slouch BootsA hot footwear trend this season, slouch boots have a sassy edge that sets them apart from their more upstanding riding boot counterparts. With a block heel and mid-calf height, Ralph Lauren’s Artizan Dress Boot in suede pairs perfectly with winter’s midi lengths ($170 at Macy’s). A sharper toe and thinner heel like Schutz’s Ashlee Slouch Boot ($178 at Nordstrom) complement more sophisticated dresses and suits. For added variety, the slouch can morph into a kitten-heeled bootie (Journee Collection’s Jo Bootie, $74.99 at Zappos) or a knee-high style like Crown Vintage’s comfy Devorah Boot ($129.99 at DSW). Just remember, brown is the new black. Courtesy of Macy's The Crossbody ClutchHeavy purses like hobos and totes frequently contribute to shoulder pain. It’s not just the weight of the purses but everything stuffed in them that can aggravate aging joints. Enter the mini crossbody clutch – this season’s favorite purse shape and the salvation for mature shoulders. Besides their soft, compact silhouette, this hands-free style features magnetic-closing clasps and detachable crossbody straps. You can find them in a range of prices, from Bottega Veneta’s high-end Mini Pouch Leather Clutch ($1,550 at Neiman Marcus) to Mansur Gavriel’s Mini Cloud Clutch ($495 at Bloomingdale’s) to one of the best knockoffs around — Steve Madden’s Nikki Faux Leather Crossbody Clutch ($49 at Nordstrom). Available in black to brights, each weighs less than a pound. Your shoulders say thank you. Courtesy of BaubleSky Layering NecklacesWinter is the season of layering, and that extends all the way to jewelry this year. Where once there was a single pendant or twinkling statement necklace, there now are layers of three, four, even more necklaces, each with a different length and chain style. Scour your jewelry drawer for a delicate chain that hits at the collarbone, a slightly longer one with an initial locket and a longer-still version with a birthstone pendant. If you’re not lucky enough to have those handy, you can find plenty of options on Etsy, starting with Babeina, shopseewhy, BaubleSky and TheSilverWren ($26–$67). Courtesy of The Metropolitan Museum of Art Store The Art of the EarringThe best earrings are the ones that fit your style and don’t belong to everybody else. Unique offerings are the trademark of museum gift shops, where the art of the earring is celebrated coast to coast. At the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s store, you can choose from more than 125 pairs, including the dramatic Golden Disc Huggie Earrings inspired by Javanese ear clips in the museum’s collection ($85, store.metmuseum.org). For the Corning Museum of Glass Shops, New York jewelry maker Michael Vincent Michaud captures the translucent hues of stained glass in his Mosaic Dainty Post Earrings ($81, shops.cmog.org). And the Getty Museum Store showcases one of that institution’s most popular works —Irisesby Vincent van Gogh — in teardrop to stud styles set in silver and even gold leaf ($50–$235 at shop.getty.edu). Courtesy of Pomegranate Moon Statement ScarvesOn dark, wintry days, few things can brighten your mood — or an outfit — like a stretch of color draped around your shoulders or knotted at the neck. For an artsy touch, Pomegranate Moon delivers an oblong swath of black chiffon embroidered in Nepal with large, textured polka dots and edged at the ends with candy-wrapper tassels. Pick from a rich, bold palette or more subtle neutrals ($67 at pomegranatemoon.com). Equally exclusive but more traditional, the Fraas collection at Bloomingdale’s provides an assortment of elegant silk squares with paisley and scroll patterns framed by pale turquoise, light gray or goldenrod ($48–$98). Another standout is Talbots’ Vibrant Paisley Silk Square Scarf in raspberry and navy, which receives high marks for draping and tying beautifully ($79.50). Courtesy of Talbot's Snuggly ScarvesBlock that blast of frigid air at your coat collar — and look totally put together while doing it — with a variety of clever and colorful options. The Scandinavian style masters at H&M solve the warmth-without-bulk issue with a freestanding turtleneck that folds softly around the neck and doesn’t add an extra layer elsewhere. Called the Ribbed Tube Scarf, it comes in camel, light beige and black ($12.99). Perk up solid coats with an on-trend plaid blanket scarf draped around the shoulders or layered dramatically at the neck. Old Navy has seven colorations to choose from ($17.99). Texture also adds drama and cable knits rise to the challenge in chunky Italian wool at Banana Republic ($129) or more refined cotton at Talbots ($54.50). Courtesy of Banana Republic That’s a WrapPark your cardigan and consider slipping into a poncho instead. Part scarf, part sweater, the poncho is all drama and options. In cream or gray colorations, the Border Stripe Wool-Blend Poncho at Banana Republic showcases this silhouette’s versatility ($119). Belt it. Sling it over your shoulder like a shawl. Leave it loose and flowing like a winter caftan. For more coverage, Ann Taylor offers its Colorblock Mock Neck Poncho ($98) in two sizes and three shades — seashell, soft steel or chocolate. On the rugged side, Aran Sweater Market’s cable-knit ponchos evoke Claire’s woodsy outfits in the popularOutlanderseries on Starz. The Cable & Moss Poncho comes in seven colors, including ivory, parsnip and charcoal ($89.95).","The holidays have come and gone.

",7/2/2022,How to Find Love on Valentine’s Day When You Are on Your Own,"Oh, Valentine’s Day. Hearts. Chocolate. Roses. Red and pink tissue paper everywhere. I’ve been a sucker for every bit of this holiday since I started sending Snoopy cards in first grade.I’ve learned, however, it’s not the cards or gifts that matter. It’s not the day itself. Traditional romance doesn’t cut it, either. These things have nothing to do with love.Valentine’s Day is — first and foremost — about money. More than 161 million Americans spend roughly $27.9 billion on this sentimental holiday each year, according to credit.com. But this celebration of love is more than a made-up capitalist marketing occasion designed to drain our wallets. Cupid’s chokehold bears valuable lessons, if you let yourself see and feel them.Try this: Make a list of the truest romances in your life — the ones that still make you cry with gratitude. For most of us, it’s not a romantic partner except in our imagination when a sappy old song comes on the radio. And if you do have that one-in-a-million romance, my heartfelt congratulations. You won the love lottery.For me, what comes to mind first is my friends. The boys and girls who laughed with me until Moa-Moa Punch came out our noses after school at Baskin-Robbins. The ones who grew into men and women who listened to me, long-distance at 5 a.m., crying adult tears until snot came out that same nose. I never had a lover or partner do that for me.Second, there is no romance to equal the love I feel for the kids in my life. The only unconditional love I’ve ever experienced, the purest emotion, is the love that children have expressed for me. Their pudgy hands in mine. The way their whole bodies soften when they see me at the airport gate waiting for them. The conviction that I make the world’s best Thanksgiving gravy, even though it comes from a powder that costs $1.99.What about the strangers who’ve saved us? The freshman dean’s secretary who confronted me about my anorexia and drug abuse and took me to the self-help group that taught me how to save myself. (Not kidding, her name was Hope.) The airport rental-car employee who, while seeing me struggle after a long flight with three kids under age 5, an absentee husband who made me feel invisible even when he was right next to me, a cart of luggage and two car seats, bumped me to the front of his line. The locksmith who told me he’d be at my apartment in five days, but when I confessed I’d just broken up with a man who had been physically abusing me, responded, “I’ll be there in 20 minutes.”And the pets? The ones who sleep on my chest every night? Lick my hand when I’m watching a scary movie on the couch?  Sheesh. There’s no romance likethat.Or the random moments of beauty that life tosses our way. The wildflowers on the highway. The first red leaf in fall. A cardinal poking for seeds in the snow. A visit to your childhood home. Graffiti that feels written just for you.Instead of pining for a red rose and then being surprised by its thorns, consider these Valentine’s Day ideas.Send a surprise valentine to 10 people who’ve helped you at key moments in your life.Organize a girls night out for your single pals.Volunteer at a soup kitchen and hand out chocolate kisses along with hot soup.Host a Valentine's Day sleepover for the children of a beloved couple who want a romantic evening alone.Plan a date night with yourself: Your favorite food. The movie you want to watch. Your pajamas, instead of that itchy dress and compression shorts.We are not idiots to glorify romantic love with its own holiday. Itisglorious. Maybe the only thing besides ice cream worth living for. But we are fools to define it narrowly, a one-on-one love that leads to happily ever after.I’m not sure why I would want a lover for Valentine’s Day, anyway. Lovers can be deceptive and messy and destructive. Cupid, after all, comes with a bow and a painfully sharp arrow. Romeo and Juliet died! I left my second husband when I realized that, if I were on my deathbed, instead of holding my hand as I transitioned to the afterworld, he’d be scanning his phone. The most delicious-looking chocolates sometimes have black-licorice centers.Stop and think: How long does happily ever after last, anyway? How foolish are we to believe that life is going to end for us in a shower of pink hearts and rainbows? I’m old enough to have seen death, and that’s not what it’s like.Love is far more complicated, and at times mysterious, than any romance novel or fairy tale would lead us to believe. Love often comes disguised and in unexpected forms. It’s up to us to see love and to trust that we are worthy of receiving love, and giving it, even when it doesn’t arrive on February 14 wrapped in a red bow.","Oh, Valentine’s Day.

",14-02-2022,What Do Women Really Want? And Will We Ever Get It?,"We want to be subjects, not objects. We want to be seen as strivers, creators, intelligent creatures. We want to be respected for our differences from men rather than ridiculed. The jokes are no longer funny. In an age when women are often breadwinners, caregivers and mothers all at once, the diminishment of women seems obsolete.Of course, there are still unfunny men who like to joke about women. But they seem to be very old or dying out. What do women want? We want to be able to joke about ourselves. We know our own failings and we have not lost our sense of humor. But it has certainly changed — now that we do everything that men do and can do it backward in heels, many of our jokes seem to be about exhaustion. When we are alone with other women, we might joke about physical things like arthritis and menstruation and menopause, but we will never do that in mixed company. So, there are jokes that exist only between women. Women need women now more than ever, because only a woman knows what it’s like to live in a woman’s skin.Women used to be tweaked about their role in the kitchen, but now men do a lot of cooking. It’s no longer funny to joke about how many women it takes to change a light bulb. Jokes about women’s supposed inabilities have gone the way of the corset and the petticoat.But we don’t want to become as humorless as men have sometimes been. We know that we’re not perfect and we want to invent ways of joking about it. But that will be impossible until we are completely equal. In a world where women still struggle for equal rights and abortion, humor is hard to come by. But women tend to be funny about their lives, particularly with other women.Abortion is not funny. Even Gloria Steinem’s quote “If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament” has more gravity than levity. We’re not going to joke about abortion. So, what can we joke about?That leaves us with the failings of men. Though reversing roles in this simple way is really no fun. We love men. Even when they’re ridiculous. We hardly want to diminish them. Now that men and women are moving toward an equal playing field, mutually encouraging jokes, even subtly sexual ones, can be amusing, if not knee slapping.My husband comes into the room and says he is going to have lunch. I ask him, “Do you want me to come?” He says, “I always want you to come….” In other words, if neither sex is the butt of jokes, what will jokes be about? We are going to have to invent a whole new, nonsexist kind of humor. Are we capable of it?Both men and women are able to be ridiculous. The old jokes about women making absurd mistakes don’t tickle us. Money is no longer funny. Women never have enough money — we are paid less than men are. The inequality about money is shocking when you think about it, because women do so much of the world’s work.The iconic Henny Youngman line “Take my wife, please” is no longer funny. Many women do not even want to be wives. The challenge will be to find humor that is universal and not diminishing. I wrack my brain for examples.It seems to me that what women need most today is time. After that, money. After that, sleep. And we need one another. We need equal pay for equal time. We need our ideas and opinions to be received without prejudice. We need to be able to work in any field without being shoved into lesser categories.Tokenism is rampant. Beautiful women — often women of color — are front and center in advertising and in all media: television, magazines, billboards and, perhaps most important, social media. The exemplary woman may be brown, yellow or white, giving the impression that all races are treated and represented equally — but that is an illusion.Behind the scenes, it’s the “same old, same old.” Women need meaningful work and equality of access. Women need support for their families, including support for breastfeeding in the workplace and for maternity. The truth is, we are still far from that. The beautiful world created by the media (celebrating racial and sexual diversity) is not the world we live in (yet).What do women really want, and will we ever get it? We want equality of opportunity and understanding of the multiple roles we play and how they are undercut by prejudice. We are always noted for our appearance before our brainpower, unlike men, who get to grow old and paunchy and bald, and people still say how smart they are.We still want to laugh but without being the butt of the joke. Everything we do takes time and energy. We want acknowledgment that even if our lives look seamless and easy, they are not.","We want to be subjects, not objects. We want to be seen as strivers, creators, intelligent creatures. We want to be respected for our differences from men rather than ridiculed. The jokes are no longer funny. In an age when women are often breadwinners, caregivers and mothers all at once, the diminishment of women seems obsolete.Of course, there are still unfunny men who like to joke about women. But they seem to be very old or dying out. What do women want? We want to be able to joke about ourselves. We know our own failings and we have not lost our sense of humor. But it has certainly changed — now that we do everything that men do and can do it backward in heels, many of our jokes seem to be about exhaustion. When we are alone with other women, we might joke about physical things like arthritis and menstruation and menopause, but we will never do that in mixed company. So, there are jokes that exist only between women. Women need women now more than ever, because only a woman knows what it’s like to live in a woman’s skin.Women used to be tweaked about their role in the kitchen, but now men do a lot of cooking. It’s no longer funny to joke about how many women it takes to change a light bulb. Jokes about women’s supposed inabilities have gone the way of the corset and the petticoat.But we don’t want to become as humorless as men have sometimes been. We know that we’re not perfect and we want to invent ways of joking about it. But that will be impossible until we are completely equal. In a world where women still struggle for equal rights and abortion, humor is hard to come by. But women tend to be funny about their lives, particularly with other women.Abortion is not funny. Even Gloria Steinem’s quote “If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament” has more gravity than levity. We’re not going to joke about abortion. So, what can we joke about?That leaves us with the failings of men. Though reversing roles in this simple way is really no fun. We love men. Even when they’re ridiculous. We hardly want to diminish them. Now that men and women are moving toward an equal playing field, mutually encouraging jokes, even subtly sexual ones, can be amusing, if not knee slapping.My husband comes into the room and says he is going to have lunch. I ask him, “Do you want me to come?” He says, “I always want you to come….” In other words, if neither sex is the butt of jokes, what will jokes be about? We are going to have to invent a whole new, nonsexist kind of humor. Are we capable of it?Both men and women are able to be ridiculous. The old jokes about women making absurd mistakes don’t tickle us. Money is no longer funny. Women never have enough money — we are paid less than men are. The inequality about money is shocking when you think about it, because women do so much of the world’s work.The iconic Henny Youngman line “Take my wife, please” is no longer funny. Many women do not even want to be wives. The challenge will be to find humor that is universal and not diminishing. I wrack my brain for examples.It seems to me that what women need most today is time. After that, money. After that, sleep. And we need one another. We need equal pay for equal time. We need our ideas and opinions to be received without prejudice. We need to be able to work in any field without being shoved into lesser categories.Tokenism is rampant.

",14-02-2022,The Dog Breeds That Are a Woman's Best Friend,"Whether you're looking for protection, snuggles, an exercise partner or just a playmate, a canine companion offers all of these benefits and more.I grew up with several German shepherds. My father gave them quirky nicknames, but my bestie was Ziggy. He was a sweet, patient dog that allowed me to dress him in doll bonnets and skirts. I can't remember when there wasn't a dog in my life, and I know that my home would not feel complete without my fur babies at my side.“Numerous studies have proved that dogs help engage our minds, provide positive emotional support for people with depression and PTSD, help promote healing after injuries and surgeries, and at the very basic level promote physical activity by requiring regular walks and activity,” says Jake Seeman, a doctor of veterinary medicine at the Bayview Animal Clinic in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.Seeman adds that those walks can lead to new friends, and even romance: ""I have several clients who have met their significant others by way of their dogs.""Karen D'Uva, a widow and television producer living in Pompano Beach, Florida, advocates for adopting rescue dogs. She adopted Mr. Carson, a deer head Chihuahua, after he'd been abandoned. ""The benefits of having a dog for a single woman at any age are immeasurable,” says D’Uva. “Mr. Carson is truly my best friend and companion. He adores me, is loyal and calms me. It’s not so easy finding this unconditional love with a human.”Here are six dog breeds that make excellent canine companions for women — especially those who live alone.  GOLDEN RETRIEVERHeight: 23-24 inches (males), 21.5-22.5 inches (females)Weight: 65-75 pounds (males), 55-65 pounds (females)Longevity: 10-12 yearsTraits: Playful, energetic, eager to please, affectionateGolden retrievers are obedient, smart, trustworthy pups often used as guide dogs. If you're looking for a workout buddy with a lot of stamina, this breed loves playing outdoors, though they also do well inside while you're away at work. Goldens are happiest around people, and they can bring out the social side of even the shiest female owners. ""As a former cat person, my first golden retriever, Jasper, made me fall in love with the breed,"" says Mimi Botscheller of Pompano Beach, Florida. ""I've owned several since then because they're incredibly intelligent, loving dogs. As pups, mine were energetic and a bit of a challenge, but they love to work and keep an eye out for me. But as guard dogs — give them a piece of jerky and they'll let anyone in the house!""  BOXERHeight: 23-25 inches (males), 21.5-23.5 inches (females)Weight: 65-80 pounds (males), 50-65 pounds (females)Longevity: 10-12 yearsTraits: Bright, active, courageous, funnyThe energetic boxer has a playful attitude and is perfect for women looking for a medium-sized, protective breed. They don't require too much space, which is great for urban dwellers. They make better single pets, since they prefer not to share their owner's attention with anyone else, which is something to consider if you're thinking of getting married or inviting someone else to live with you.  MASTIFFHeight: 30+ inches (males), 27.5+ inches (females)Weight: 160-230 pounds (males), 120-170 pounds (females)Longevity: 6-10 yearsTraits: Affectionate, calm, protectiveThese enormous dogs are patient, lovable companions that are good-natured and usually easy to manage. Mastiffs are also large enough to intimidate any intruders with their formidable bark and will protect their owner at any cost. At the same time, they're docile dogs that can make great couch-potato companions if you're looking for a snuggle buddy.However, this breed may not be perfect for the coach-potato type. ""My 115-pound dog is very headstrong and physically strong,” says Karen Hockman of Manassas, Virginia. “The only way to handle him is to exhaust him with long walks, swimming and playing with other dogs. But he's a sweet, gentle giant who lets me wrap my arms around him and give him lots of kisses.""  CAVALIER KING CHARLES SPANIELHeight: 12-13 inches (males and females)Weight: 13-18 pounds (males and females)Longevity: 12-15 yearsTraits: Gentle, athletic, even-tempered, gracefulThe Cavalier King Charles spaniel is an excellent lapdog for women who want a small, affectionate companion. However, they don't like being separated from their owner, and are prone to anxiety if left alone for too long. Keep this in mind if you work late hours or travel extensively. Fortunately, these pups love adventure and make great travel buddies if you're able to bring your pet along for the ride.  PUGHeight: 10-13 inches (males and females)Weight: 14-18 pounds (males and females)Longevity: 13-15 yearsTraits: Playful, loving, mischievous, sociableLooking for a snuggly companion? The pug is the dog for you! But don't count on this breed for protective purposes — they're not very good watchdogs. They enjoy long naps and are happiest sprawled out on their owner's lap. If you need to work long hours, they adjust well to being left alone, since they spend much of their time sleeping. They're also ideal dogs for apartment living.I rescued a pug nine years ago and loved his quirky personality so much that I adopted two more! I'm a sucker for their expressive eyes, wrinkled brows, Cinnabon-shaped tails, and synchronized head tilts when I talk to them. Pugs are funny, affectionate dogs, and I cannot imagine living without one.  AUSTRALIAN SHEPHERDHeight: 20-23 inches (males), 18-21 inches (females)Weight: 50-60 pounds (males), 40-55 pounds (females)Traits: Athletic, protective, affectionateAustralian shepherds are medium-sized herding dogs that need plenty of mental and physical exercise. They are easily trained, and make great workout partners for single women who lead active lives. These dogs can be sensitive and clingy at times, but they offer an abundance of love that's hard to resist. You'll never be lonely with an Australian shepherd — they’ll stick to you like glue.*All breed information is based on stats from the American Kennel Club at https://www.akc.org/","Whether you're looking for protection, snuggles, an exercise partner or just a playmate, a canine companion offers all of these benefits and more.I grew up with several German shepherds.

",29-06-2020,I'm in My 60s. Here's Why I Still Go Back to the Same Summer Camp,"I keep a photograph next to my computer of me hitting a softball that ended up in a home run. I am a young teen, and the Blue Team captain at Camp Agawak. That run meant a win for our team. I keep that picture in a spot where I can see it dozens of times each day, a reminder ofwho I once wasand of who I still am today.I am an athlete. Driven. Outdoorsy. A team builder and a team player. A camp girl forever. All that is very adventurous, very brave and very mischievous about who I am today was birthed and nurtured in those pine woods. I loved Agawak so much, I could not stay away.At the age of 59, I began working at my old camp in the northern woods of Wisconsin, the same camp where I spent 10 summers of my youth. I returned to resurrect the camp magazine that died in the early 1980s, the publication that launched my literary career. This summer marks my seventh season back. I now work with young campers on their writing skills, and on their life skills — like my counselors did for me.The emotions and nostalgia, and realization of how camp can shape a life, come together in my new book,Camp Girls.Yesterday, I was kayaking on the Severn River that fronts our Maryland home. As I am pulling hard with the paddle and gliding swiftly, I hear imaginary girls screaming, “Stroke harder, harder.” My memory rises in a haunting chorus of the dozens of co-paddlers who have joined me at camp, in kayaks and canoes, in team competitions and on camping trips — more than a half-century ago. I hear us coaching each other to pull deeper, harder, faster, in our pristine Wisconsin lake where water lilies float like billowy angels.My shoulders ache at the memory of our weeklong canoe trip through the Boundary Waters of Canada, much of which was spent in a pelting rain. Our arms shook from portaging heavy green wooden canoes. That adventure was the most grueling experience of my then 14 years, and something I look back on with pride. I think of that painful trek through the mud when I need to muster up the strength totry something new as an adult.Spending lots of summers learning land and water sports, we became capable athletes in boat races, golf, volleyball, fencing, horseback riding, archery and track. On Blue Lake, I learned eight strokes, six dives, how to sail, canoe, row, kayak andwater-ski.Along with the athletic prowess we gained at summer camp, the greatest gifts of all arelifelong friendships. These are the camp girls who have tracked me, and stuck with me, as a chubby child, a skinny bride, over bumps in raising four sons and staying married to one husband, through the sudden death of my father and the long illness of my late mother. We support each other through thelonely sting of an empty nest.We met as timid youth with velvety cheeks and grew together from flirty teenagers into a powerful sisterhood that includes some grandmothers. We now compare maps of wrinkles, though some have chosen to erase time withprocedures. Yet we all realize that Botox may fix faces but cannot fix the yearnings of the soul — only love can, and we certainly give that to each other.Our girl circle is the most effective and enduring of antiaging regimens, a tribe that makes us feel forever young. We may have gray hair but we have teenage hearts. So many lessons from activities at camp and adapting to communal living can form the spine of a successful adult life, most notably collaboration and perseverance.As I prepare to return to camp this June, I am conditioning myself on long hikes in Maryland so I can again keep up with girls a sixth my age. I hope soon to walk with young campers up hills and along familiar paths, stepping over gnarled roots I know the shape and location of instinctively.What a blessing to be anchored in the landscape I memorized as a girl. As a young journalist in Dallas, I interviewed a 64-year-old woman in Fort Worth who was a champion rodeo rider. She wore silver-tipped crocodile boots and a belt with a silver buckle cinching her tiny waist. I remember thinking at the time: “This is who I want to be in 40 years.” Well, I am not a rodeo rider, but I can still do a flip on the trampoline. This stunt I mastered at age 9 I love to do now at camp, to show off for the young girls, proving that playfulness and agility do not die with age.When my tribe of older camp girls reunites at Agawak, we still swim hard and play hard, then sit arms linked around a campfire, blackening marshmallows for s’mores. We are transported back to a place of deeply rooted joy, of belonging to a family — not of blood, but of history and loyalty.We talk about how our cookouts and canoe trips and long-standing friendships have infused us with qualities that compose the best of who we are today. Together at camp, summer after summer, we gained the capacity to be open to the unfamiliar, plucked from doting parents and thrust into self-reliance. Here by the lake, dwarfed by towering trees and surrounded by really fun people, we became courageous and resilient, qualities that bolster us well beyond the season of summer, and throughout every age.Iris Krasnow’s new bookCamp Girls: Fireside Lessons on Friendship, Courage and Loyalty(April-Grand Central Publishing) is on sale now.","I keep a photograph next to my computer of me hitting a softball that ended up in a home run.

",9/7/2020,I Had to Grow Up to Understand My Mother-in-Law,"I met Rich at my first job out of college. After a year of dating, he proposed. We were both 23 years old.A few days after our engagement, my mother called my future in-laws to offer congratulations and to discuss wedding plans. My mother-in-law was cool on the phone. She made it clear that she thought Rich was too young to get married and that my not being Catholic was an issue. Basically, without directly saying it, she told my mother that I wasn’t right for her son.Later, my mother recapped the conversation for me and said, “I kept saying how much we liked Rich and what a nice guy he was, and she just agreed. She didn’t say one nice thing about you.”I was sad but not surprised. I hoped that once we were married, my mother-in-law would warm to me, but she did not. Her arctic demeanor toward me didn’t change even though I tried to be a good daughter-in-law, wife and mother. She just didn’t seem to like me very much, and after 20 years, she still didn’t have one nice thing to say about me.I assumed that our cool relationship would never change. But then I turned 48. It was the same age my mother-in-law was when we first met.Some parts of my life at 48 were the same as hers. We were both mothers of three — two daughters and a son. We both love all of our kids but especially adore our boys. I'm not sure how I would feel if a woman came and stole my son's heart right now, but considering he is only 15, I probably have some time. Still, for the first time ever, I understand how tough it would be to have another woman enter my son’s life.But more than our similarities, what struck me were the big differences in our lives at the same age. When my mother-in-law was 45, her mother died in a car accident. She was still in mourning when her husband became ill. When I was introduced to my father-in-law, he had just been diagnosed with cancer. At 51, my mother-in-law would be a widow.At 48, I was able to view myself the way my mother-in-law did when she was that age. She was scared, sad and lonely. Within a few years she had lost her mother, and she was about to lose her husband. And then here I was, ready to take her only son. And not only was he getting married, he was choosing to raise his family in a different faith. That meant she wouldn’t be able to take her grandchildren on Easter egg hunts or to the mall to see Santa.When I was 23, I wished my mother-in-law had been more gracious and more welcoming. Now that I am 48, I wish that I had been more compassionate and empathetic. I can’t imagine my life right now without my mother or my husband. She must have felt so alone. I think she couldn’t open her heart to me because it was broken, and, in many ways, it never totally healed.I had to grow up to really understand my mother-in-law. And once I did, things changed between us. I think she is even slowly warming up to me.Just last week she asked me to order her a few items online. I was happy to oblige, and she was appreciative. In fact, she complimented me for getting everything to her so quickly. I guess it was more praise for Amazon’s delivery speed than for me, but she said something nice about me. Maybe she likes me after all.","I met Rich at my first job out of college. After a year of dating, he proposed.

She just didn’t seem to like me very much, and after 20 years, she still didn’t have one nice thing to say about me.I assumed that our cool relationship would never change. But then I turned 48. It was the same age my mother-in-law was when we first met.Some parts of my life at 48 were the same as hers. We were both mothers of three — two daughters and a son. We both love all of our kids but especially adore our boys. I'm not sure how I would feel if a woman came and stole my son's heart right now, but considering he is only 15, I probably have some time. Still, for the first time ever, I understand how tough it would be to have another woman enter my son’s life.But more than our similarities, what struck me were the big differences in our lives at the same age. When my mother-in-law was 45, her mother died in a car accident. She was still in mourning when her husband became ill. When I was introduced to my father-in-law, he had just been diagnosed with cancer. At 51, my mother-in-law would be a widow.At 48, I was able to view myself the way my mother-in-law did when she was that age. She was scared, sad and lonely. Within a few years she had lost her mother, and she was about to lose her husband. And then here I was, ready to take her only son. And not only was he getting married, he was choosing to raise his family in a different faith. That meant she wouldn’t be able to take her grandchildren on Easter egg hunts or to the mall to see Santa.When I was 23, I wished my mother-in-law had been more gracious and more welcoming. Now that I am 48, I wish that I had been more compassionate and empathetic. I can’t imagine my life right now without my mother or my husband. She must have felt so alone. I think she couldn’t open her heart to me because it was broken, and, in many ways, it never totally healed.I had to grow up to really understand my mother-in-law. And once I did, things changed between us. I think she is even slowly warming up to me.Just last week she asked me to order her a few items online. I was happy to oblige, and she was appreciative. In fact, she complimented me for getting everything to her so quickly. I guess it was more praise for Amazon’s delivery speed than for me, but she said something nice about me. Maybe she likes me after all."

",3/12/2020,Mom's Health Scare and My Biggest Fear,"Her head was bobbing up and down. Was she throwing up, I wondered? I enlarged the video and saw that she was on the floor, trying to get up.She was pulling the bottom drawer out of her desk, which was filled with filled papers. It was a foot and a half away from her bed. With one arm, she was trying to lean on it to lift herself up.I had no idea how she ended up down there. She had told my brother and me the day before that she had horrific stomach pains and felt nausea but couldn’t throw up. I was miles away, retreating for a month up in the Adirondack Mountains. Mom was in her house in Boca Raton, Florida, where she still lives alone at 97 years old.I was so grateful, after years of campaigning, that she finally let me install cameras in her house, a few months earlier, after she broke her shoulder on New Year’s Day.Periodically, I would check the app on my phone to see how she was doing. This particular morning, I looked to see if she was up before I called. I was shocked to see her down, trapped, stuck on the floor — the hard floor of her bedroom. It used to be carpeted but after two and a half decades, she had it removed, complaining it was a dust collector, which triggered her allergies and resultedin endless sneezing spells. Now, she was on an unrelenting surface — slippery tile. I spotted some towels or rags or sheets on the floor. She must have pulled them off her bed in an attempt to put her knees on them to lift up.Through the camera mounted on the ceiling, I was able to speak to her, assuming she didn’t have either her landline or mobile phones within arms’ reach. “Mom, are you OK?” I called out loudly.She mumbled what sounded like “Yeah.”“Why don’t you get yourself to the front of your bed where you have the rug, and then you’ll have some traction to pull yourself up?”Mom was nearly there, as she was close to the bottom right corner of her queen-sized bed. As I watched her trying to move her body, I felt tightness in my throat and a knot in my stomach. It seemed as if her legs were dead weight that she was trying to drag. She still had a bad shoulder from her fall a few months before, which she never received any physical therapy for, and when the sling went off six weeks later, COVID hit and everyone was sheltering in place.I couldn’t continue to watch her struggle.“Mom, stop. Just rest. I’m going to call Filipe. He has the keys to your house and the code to the alarm, right?”She muttered, “Yes.”Mom was not herself, the “sharp as a tack” dynamo who traded stocks, did “puts” and “options” (whatever those are) and prided herself in her investing prowess. She was saying things that didn’t make sense. I was thankful to have reached Filipe. It was 11:40 a.m. and he worked until noon doing handy work in mom’s country club community called Boca Pointe. That’s Pointe with an “e” at the end, the admin at the clubhouse had said when I picked up my card for the athletic center, never referred to as a gym.Filipe was the only person other than myself that Mom trusted enough to give a set of keys to her house. He’s worked at Boca Pointe longer than Mom’s lived there, which is 26 years.As I waited the short five minutes for Filipe to arrive, I spoke to her, “Mom, don’t move. Filipe will be there soon. What happened? How did you end up on the floor?”“I don’t know, Gayle. I probably slipped off my bed.” She was irritated by my question.Slipped off her bed?Even though Dad passed 14 years prior, Mom still sleeps on her side, on the edge with her behind often hanging over.The way the Ring camera is aimed from its mount on the ceiling, I can only see Mom through the reflection in the mirrored sliding closet doors facing her. It just takes a bit of blowing up theimage. The large shade of the night lamp takes up the foreground, blocking a direct view. I always pray she keeps her reflective wardrobe doors closed.Filipe, a handsome, gentle and kind man with a full head of thick wavy hair, entered Mom’s bedroom.“You OK ?” he asked Mom, with his charming Portuguese accent. Mom shook her head.Filipe bent down behind her and slipped his arms under each of hers and slowly lifted her up. Mom stood, getting more hunched over, and now wobbly, wearing a pink, long,, extra-large T-shirt she sleeps in. He waited for her to get back into bed.“Thank you so much, Filipe. You’re a lifesaver,” I called out as he looked up at the camera.Later that day, Mom complained about harsh abdominal pain and was eager to see her doctor. When she called to make an appointment, she told them about her symptoms. The nurse informed her it could be COVID-19.And they couldn’t see her until she had the results. Then they instructed her to go to a local urgent care facility that was only administering COVID tests to people with symptoms. She was informed it would take 10 to 14 days to get the results.While there, Mom asked the nurse, “Can you please touch my stomach? I am in severe pain.”The nurse spread her fingers and gently touched mom’s abdominal area, as she cringed.“Go back to your doctor and tell them they should do an ultrasound,” the nurse advised her.The following day, Mom texted me, “I’m going to the ER.They have all the equipment. And if I need to be admitted, I’ll be there already.”Alone, no family near her, only a few friends, my head was spinning with worry. The thought of losing her was inconceivable. She, widowed, and me, single — she had become “my everything.”The person I spoke to several times a day, hung out with on FaceTime as I cooked, and offered tips. She was my travel companion and my best editor, even when it was unflattering words about her.The scan showed she had acute diverticulitis, and she was going to be admitted into the hospital.The floor she’d be on would be determined by the result of the COVID-`19 test they administered.Twenty minutes later, she learned she was negative.“Gayle, you need to write a story about how doctors refuse to see you because they’re afraid you have COVID. Don’t they realize there are other diseases that affect the body besides COVID?” she begged me, seething with anger.If Mom had waited any longer, she could have died, the doctor said. If she had a severe rupture in her intestines, she would have been rushed into surgery. “She might not have lived through it at her age,” he explained.As she was in the hospital, receiving high doses of IV antibiotics, I knew I had to get to her as soon as possible. Packing up my rented condo in Lake Placid as I organized her care on the phone, I had to get back home to my place in the city. A day later, I took the first plane out on Delta. No quarantining for two weeks, which I had originally planned for my August visit for her birthday. Just went directly to her house, wearing a mask.It’s been nearly four weeks since I’ve been here. We have a nurse who comes daily to administer her antibiotics and an aid to help her shower and with her other needs. Each day, Mom gets a little stronger.

",8/7/2020,The Secrets to Repairing Damaged Hair,"So, let’s cut to the chase. You’ve been merrily using a blow-dryer or flat or heat-curling iron on your hair daily … and that’s on top of coloring, highlighting, relaxing or straightening? I’m not surprised your hair feels like cotton candy, looks like straw and is breaking and thinning, because I’ve been there, too. And let me clue you in: Celebs are not immune to hair havoc, either. Their frequent style and color changes often hide mishaps. Here’s a rehab plan that works for us all.1. Make a big cutFor long hair devotees, the ends are the oldest and most-damaged part since they’ve been exposed to heat and chemicals for years. Splits start at the bottom and travel like a zipper up toward the scalp. Don’t panic: This doesn’t mean a pixie cut (but check tip No. 4, anyway!). A generous trim — at least three inches — or snipping to a long bob (aka lob) keeps the long-hair feeling, but with a fresher look. Helen Mirren keeps her fine hair healthy and stylish with a little layering.WireImage 2. Add layers to disguise breakageWhen severe damage is causing funky layers or shorter chunks at the back of your head or around your face, go with it. The best bet may be to layer upmorefor a shaggy, choppy medium style with extra volume, movement and texture. In addition to bobs and lobs, shags are trendy again, so this solution is smart and fashionable. Robin Wright’s side part and choppy ends make her fine hair look robust.NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images 3. Cut long feathery or side-swept bangsBangs instantly clean up dead ends and breakage around the hairline. Since the look requires frequent trims, this part of your hair will show healthy regrowth first. Bangs also create a thicker illusion for those whose hair quality has been compromised by thinning due to excessive heat and color. Caption neededGetty Images 4. Going short offers immediate benefitsMaybe you’ve been eyeing the cropped blond styles on (from left) Cynthia Erivo, Brigitte Nielsen or Tilda Swinton. If you want high-drama color, a short cut enables you to stick with major intensity but keep a healthy hair and scalp routine, thanks to frequent snips. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re ready for a gutsy change go for it. Even a color-free gray or white short, tousled crop is a hair-health booster. Just keep the style a little tousled, messy and broken up for a sexy cool grownup effect like Jamie Lee Curtis (right). Melanie Griffith often wears her long, blond hair up and lets her bangs provide style.WireImage 5. Wash hair less oftenWhatever your hair length or style, no one wants greasy hair. Dry shampoo is a great alternative, but there is even a limit to that. Water-only shampoos twice a week are fine for damaged hair, but find new ways to style your hair in between. Try a low ponytail, a messy bun or topknot. Change the part or add some texturizing spray for beauty waves, and keep a fake ponytail or bun to clip at the nape at the ready — like lots of stars do. Kyra Sedgwick lets her brown roots blend into blond.WireImage 6. Find a new color solutionIf you’re on a high-maintenance, once-a-month schedule or overdo the bleach and highlights too often (as I did in my blond-aholic days), get comfy with showing your roots for a longer stretch. How about applying a touch-up spray between redos? Or, switch to color that’s closer to your own shade or a semipermanent formula rather than permanent. Last but not least: Try keeping your authentic color as a base and just get highlights every three months to blend in grays or brighten your hair and skin. Highlights can also help grow in gray without an obvious line if you decide to ditch color altogether for renewed hair health. Christine Baranski loosened up her impeccable big bob with some layers, wave and textured ends.WireImage 7. Let your real hair texture be OKConstant straightening requires heat, and that’s truly hard on dry, fragile mature hair. Women who used to be into stick-straight hair are going “natural” for a wavier and curlier look, or at least alternating sleek blowouts with air-drying. If you color your hair, giving it a wavy option helps ease the constant chemical/heat stress. When you do blow-dry, let your hair air-dry at least 50 percent before heat-styling, and always use a heat-protectant spray first. Flip your hair over and blow-dry on a low-heat setting from underneath, using your fingers to untangle, lift and encourage volume.8. Switch to a sulfate-free shampoo and conditionerYou won’t get that big, sudsy feeling since sulfates — which are detergents — create those bubbles, but you will be preserving chemical-color or salon-straightening treatments. Look for duos that also have strengthening protein via wheat or keratin and provide a serious moisture boost with botanical oils and butters. Drugstore brands like L’Oreal Paris EverPure, OGX, Suave Professionals and SheaMoisture all have the right ingredients to increase shine and reboot dry hair.9. Make hair masks a twice-weekly habitRegular conditioners are not enough. Drugstore masks are easier than the homemade mashed avocado-and-egg kind, and they smell better and rinse out easily. Choose one-shot foil packets so you can try several, or opt for a tube or jar style packed with oils like Argan or Marula and shea butter. The label will say to leave on for one to three — or even 10 — minutes, but do your hair a favor and leave it on overnight (with a plastic wrap turban to keep your pillow pristine). Use a wide-tooth comb to distribute the mask evenly through your hair, with a little extra on areas that are most brittle or weak.10. Buy a microfiber hair towelThis sounds unnecessary, but it’s a small thing that’s super-kind to your hair. The minute you step out of the shower, bend at the waist and wrap your hair in one of these. It absorbs excess water like a sponge. Normal towels rough up the hair’s cuticle, causing the shingle-like coating of the hair shafts to lift up instead of lying flat — and encourage breakage and frizz.And a last word: Beat hair burnout before it begins. Toss old brushes with bent bristles, replace fine-tooth combs with hair-friendly wide-tooth ones, and avoid wearing or styling your hair the same way every day. Your hair will thank you.For more beauty and style tips for women age 50-plus, check outThe Woman's Wakeup: How to Shake Up Your Looks, Life, and Love After 50by Lois Joy Johnson.","So, let’s cut to the chase.

",13-07-2020,The Daily Habit That Brought Me Closer to My Grandmother,"""Ah ya ready? Get ya shoes on!”My grandmother stood in the foyer of her small South Boston apartment, tightening a trench coat around her waist while glaring at me from under a plastic rain bonnet.Without taking my eyes off the TV, I tucked my feet under my body and curled into a ball. It was cold outside, and I had no intention of leaving behind Jan, Peter, Cindy and the rest of the bunch.""I don't want to go out,” I whined. “It's raining.""""It's just spittin',” she said about the drizzle. “Come on, we have to go. It's a long walk to the station.""Begrudgingly, I turned off the television and peeled my gangly preteen body from the sofa. As I pulled on my hoodie, my grandmother jingled the keys in her hand — her not-so-subtle way of rushing me to the door.Although 65 years older than me, my septuagenarian grandmother had seemingly endless reserves of energy. At least once a day, she'd lace up her shoes and head outside, filling hours with visits to various locales. One day might bring a half-mile stroll to my aunt's house, with a stop along the way to pick up Dunkin’ Donuts. Another might take her to the train station, where she'd ride the Red Line downtown to pay off her Filene's credit card or grab some lunch at Woolworth's. On Sundays she would stroll to Mass, passing her peers — “old ladies,” as she referred to them — who were waiting for the bus to church.Weather rarely affected these excursions. New England's temperamental meteorological swings only affected her choice of clothing: Spring's rain brought out the light coat and rain bonnet, autumn's crisp chill added a button-down cardigan, and winter's subfreezing climate meant thicker hats and boots. In summer, when the temperatures would soar and the humidity felt like a wet wool blanket, she would shed layers, embarking on her walks in light slacks and a short-sleeve shirt, a tissue in hand to wipe the sweat off her brow.I was the only child of asingle parent; my mother worked full-time and occasionally took on second or third jobs to pay the bills. We lived in the projects, with neighbors who ranged from kindly, elderly alcoholics who wandered around the building after a few too many beers to rage-fueled psychopaths who warned my mother to “watch her back.” For this reason, whenever my mother was at work and I was out of school, I was at my grandmother's.My mother's mother — Nana, as I called her — dragged me along on her daily outings, whether I was interested or not. I could think of countless reasons to stay home: TV, temperate indoor climate, comfortable couch. Why run errands by foot when you could take a cab? Why go out in inclement weather? Why leave the comforts of home to go on walks at all?But, once out and about, I'd realize, reluctantly, that I was enjoying myself. In an era when phones weren't smart and steps were taken, not counted, we walked. We talked. We laughed. We bonded. Nana told me about her family: Theverbally abusive fatherwhose alcoholism kept him unemployed for long stretches, exacerbating their poverty. The mother who tried to shield her children from their father's wrath. The grandfather who stepped in as a paternal figurehead, helping to support Nana and her 10 siblings, keeping them together and out of an orphanage.She spoke of her family's home: a two-room apartment, where she slept in one bed with her brothers and sisters, a small wood-burning stove the only source of warmth. Her late-night trips to the outhouse, only a small firelit lamp to guide her way. I heard about the little brothers who died — one from a broken leg before the advent of penicillin, one who was run over by a horse-drawn carriage, one from injuries sustained during World War II — and the mourning that enveloped her mother like a shroud. I was fascinated by her upbringing, so different from my own.Though I didn't realize it at the time, I know now that my grandmother didn't go on these walks for her health or to fulfill a doctor's regimen. It was a way to pass the time, to get outside and to spend time with me. Just the two of us, uninterrupted, far from the siren call of the television screen.Through each passing season, our jaunts took us to our favorite spots — from the hustle and bustle of the city to the quiet hush of a public library. I'd come home from our trips with novelties — a new book, a Happy Meal prize andknowledge about my grandmotherthat brought us even closer than the day before.""All done?” she'd ask at the end of our trips. “Let's go home.""Decades later, I'm standing in the foyer of my Southern California house, jingling keys and watching the clock.""Are you ready?” I ask. “Let's get your shoes on.""My 2-year-old thrusts himself off the sofa as if shot from a cannon. Energy radiates from his 3-foot frame while he runs in circles around me.""Come on,” I call to my husband. “It's a long drive.”Once gathered, we step outside, the scorching heat nearly knocking us over. Although an autumn morning, the temperature is already approaching 90 — another oppressively hot Los Angeles day. The central air beckons us back inside, but we have to go. The clock is ticking, and the ride from our house to the park will take at least 30 minutes, even at this early hour.As we park our car, I look out at the sea of purple T-shirts. What would Nana have thought of this event? What would she have made of our outing, done in her honor? The Nana I knew as a child would have secretly appreciated it. Though she'd brush off any form of tributes or praise with a flap of the hand, her flushed cheeks and slight smile would give away her gratitude.The older Nana, though … I don't quite know how she would have reacted. In her later years, Nana's personality fractured; dementia created an individual whosemood changedas quickly as Boston's often inclement weather. One minute, she was kind and loving, wanting nothing more than to hear all about my new life in Los Angeles, even as I could tell she couldn't quite follow the words falling from my lips. The next minute, her anger was palpable: She'd accuse my mother of trying to poison her, hurl racist slurs at the day nurse, demand to know when her husband — who had died decades earlier — would be home. At times she was wracked with fear, the result of her surroundings, her family, even her own self being completely unfamiliar.When she passed away in 2007 at the age of 93, I was sad, though I'd felt as though the real Nana — the strong, stubborn, Bostonian who never learned to ride a bike, never learned to drive a car, never rode on an airplane, but who could outpace anyone in a walk throughout the city — had passed on years before. It is that Nana's memory that brings me out to this sun-drenched park on a hot Sunday morning.I lift my wiggly son out of his car seat and head toward check-in, my heart heavy.""Hi,” a woman says as we approach the table. “Welcome! Are you here in honor of a specific person?""""Yes,” I reply. “We're walking in memory of my grandmother.""With a smile, the woman hands us T-shirts emblazoned with the Alzheimer's Association logo and sends us off to the starting line. Placing one foot in front of the other, I walk. I walk to remember my grandmother's long life, even the last 10 years stolen by Alzheimer's disease. I walk to celebrate the memories we made. And I walk to form new memories with my son, who knows Nana only through my stories.I use a tissue to wipe the sweat from my brow as I chase after my little boy. For over a mile, my husband, son and I talk. We laugh. We bond. Though the purpose of the day is to raise money for Alzheimer's research, for me it is a link between the past and the present.As my son's energy wanes, I decide it's time to leave. With a flourish, I swoop him up into my arms and hug him close.""All done?” I ask. “Let's go home.""","""Ah ya ready? Get ya shoes on!”My grandmother stood in the foyer of her small South Boston apartment, tightening a trench coat around her waist while glaring at me from under a plastic rain bonnet.Without taking my eyes off the TV, I tucked my feet under my body and curled into a ball. It was cold outside, and I had no intention of leaving behind Jan, Peter, Cindy and the rest of the bunch.""I don't want to go out,” I whined. “It's raining.""""It's just spittin',” she said about the drizzle. “Come on, we have to go. It's a long walk to the station.""Begrudgingly, I turned off the television and peeled my gangly preteen body from the sofa. As I pulled on my hoodie, my grandmother jingled the keys in her hand — her not-so-subtle way of rushing me to the door.Although 65 years older than me, my septuagenarian grandmother had seemingly endless reserves of energy. At least once a day, she'd lace up her shoes and head outside, filling hours with visits to various locales. One day might bring a half-mile stroll to my aunt's house, with a stop along the way to pick up Dunkin’ Donuts. Another might take her to the train station, where she'd ride the Red Line downtown to pay off her Filene's credit card or grab some lunch at Woolworth's. On Sundays she would stroll to Mass, passing her peers — “old ladies,” as she referred to them — who were waiting for the bus to church.Weather rarely affected these excursions. New England's temperamental meteorological swings only affected her choice of clothing: Spring's rain brought out the light coat and rain bonnet, autumn's crisp chill added a button-down cardigan, and winter's subfreezing climate meant thicker hats and boots. In summer, when the temperatures would soar and the humidity felt like a wet wool blanket, she would shed layers, embarking on her walks in light slacks and a short-sleeve shirt, a tissue in hand to wipe the sweat off her brow.I was the only child of asingle parent; my mother worked full-time and occasionally took on second or third jobs to pay the bills. We lived in the projects, with neighbors who ranged from kindly, elderly alcoholics who wandered around the building after a few too many beers to rage-fueled psychopaths who warned my mother to “watch her back.” For this reason, whenever my mother was at work and I was out of school, I was at my grandmother's.My mother's mother — Nana, as I called her — dragged me along on her daily outings, whether I was interested or not. I could think of countless reasons to stay home: TV, temperate indoor climate, comfortable couch. Why run errands by foot when you could take a cab? Why go out in inclement weather? Why leave the comforts of home to go on walks at all?But, once out and about, I'd realize, reluctantly, that I was enjoying myself. In an era when phones weren't smart and steps were taken, not counted, we walked. We talked. We laughed. We bonded. Nana told me about her family: Theverbally abusive fatherwhose alcoholism kept him unemployed for long stretches, exacerbating their poverty. The mother who tried to shield her children from their father's wrath. The grandfather who stepped in as a paternal figurehead, helping to support Nana and her 10 siblings, keeping them together and out of an orphanage.She spoke of her family's home: a two-room apartment, where she slept in one bed with her brothers and sisters, a small wood-burning stove the only source of warmth.

",8/7/2020,What Do You Owe a Parent Who Was Mentally Ill?,"Latitude means an imaginary line around the earth, room to maneuver, a degree of tolerance of exposure error.I was never the apple of my father’s eye, at least not that I remember, though he took hundreds of black-and-white Polaroids of me as a baby and when I look at them, I see a baby smiling adoringly at the man behind the camera. He may have adored me back, though the adoration faded over time. When I was born at New York Hospital on East 68th Street in Manhattan, he was doing his residency in radiology there, and he loved taking black-and-white images. In many ways, his life became a study in black and white: Two years after I was born, he threatened to commit suicide by jumping off the roof of that hospital and was hospitalized at Payne Whitney, also on East 68th Street.Recently, my husband and I rented an apartment on West 68th Street, and I have been thinking about latitude, and how we are drawn back to people and places that both delight and confound us, and sometimes have to give them some latitude.My father recovered from that first suicide attempt and went on to become a handsome, successful, tennis-playing radiologist who loved the sun, the ocean, large dogs, trips to the Caribbean, biographies of presidents and intense games of singles. Trips to Zabar’s to buy bags of bagels, Famous Amos chocolate chip cookies and huge pieces of whitefish, and impromptu trips to Barnes & Noble, where he’d buy enormous piles of books, were some of his favorite activities. People loved him — or didn’t like him at all. I was in both camps.It is strange to write this, years after he died, but I miss him more than ever. He could be a lot of fun and had a wicked sense of humor, though he also had a ferocious mean streak. He went through bouts of depression and rage, but could also be generous and loving. One night, he’d be witty and wise, helping us write papers and offering tips on how to study (“write it down” was his suggestion for committing arcane facts and formulas to memory), and the next night, he could lay one of us out like a piece of steak and start carving out little bits, before hacking away large chunks. He had two wives, two fiancées and three kids. You could survive living with him, sure, but after you moved out, you’d wonder how you’d managed.In May, on my father’s yahrzeit — the anniversary of his death — my husband and I were up in rural New Hampshire, visiting our younger son, so instead of going to synagogue, I stood in a hotel room, looked out the window, Googled “kaddish” and said the mourners’ prayer for my father. I always forget that saying kaddish actually means praising God despite your loss. My son was sitting a few feet away from me and started to speak fondly of his grandfather. I had an epiphany:I should be praising Dad. I should be telling my kids what was good about him.Or to quote the father in Daniel Mendelsohn’s great memoir,An Odyssey: A Father, a Son, and an Epic:“Your father is your father.”I’ve been listening to Mendelsohn’s book in the car, where I also listened to Keggie Carew’sDadland. Though I’ve loved memoirs about difficult fathers (Tobias Wolff’sThis Boy’s Life, Geoffrey Wolff’sThe Duke of Deception: Memories of My Father, Jeannette Walls’The Glass Castle, Tara Westover’sEducated), I have trouble reading the happier stories. But I can listen to someone talk about their loving fathers (Michelle Obama’s father sounded like a saint in the Audible version ofBecoming). My sons have fond memories of my dad. Why don’t I tell them some more?So, 14 years after my father’s death, I’m trying to unpack his behavior and give him some latitude. My father was mentally ill. Bipolar, narcissistic, on the receiving end of his own father’s rage and depression, Dad overcame huge obstacles to go to college and medical school. You could argue that he tried his best, but his tools for coping were burying himself in history books, exercising and working hard, and none of those activities necessarily translates into loving behavior toward your family. Sometimes he was medicated; sometimes he medicated himself. He once wrote himself a prescription for lithium that I filled. If hindsight is 20/20, compassion might be, too. I had almost no sympathy for my dad while he was alive. Did he want it? Doubtful. But he might have wanted insight and understanding, which I’m trying to give him now. Growing up, I didn’t suspect he was mentally ill, though I knew this father was not like the others. He was friendly and flirtatious and my friends liked him. My mother, not so much. And that was part of the problem. I looked like my mother, and as my parents’ marriage disintegrated, my father took his rage at my mother out on me. Though I believe she loved him wildly at the beginning, she didn’t know how to handle his mood swings. She was used to the kind of love her father showed her — adoring, calm, endless. My grandfather was a math teacher at Stuyvesant High School, logical and patient, easy to live with and love. My father, coincidentally, had been one of his students. Though my mother said that my father was mean to her early on, she did not perceive this as a red flag. In her world, men were not mean to women; spouses treated each other with respect. If you haven’t grown up with this kind of bruising behavior, it doesn’t make sense. (Of course, behavior associated with mental illness often doesn’t make any sense.) In the course of her parents’ loving 65-year marriage, which took place in their modest, two-family house in Brooklyn, my mother had witnessed only love, logic and good sense.That was not the kind of household she and my father created. My father hurled insults at us for more meals than I can remember and called us all names. I was “Demandola” and “Indignola.” My mother was “sleazily charming.” He called one of his significant others “a parasite” and later questioned the durability of my marriage. He resented the comforts he provided for us, though in retrospect, I suspected he resented that we couldn’t see how hard he was working to cover up his sadness and vulnerability. He had grown up exposed to bad behavior: His own father had insulted him and his mother much the way my father insulted my mother and me. I didn’t learn about my father’s first suicide attempt until I was in high school so was never able to fully piece together that something might be broken within him. My mother left him for good when I left for college. My father remarried, had another child and attempted suicide for the second time, when he was almost 57. Miraculously, he survived and died nine years later of lymphoma. Though cancer and age mellowed his fury, he was never what you would call easy.But he could be loving and astute. Soon after I had my second son and we were walking with the boys in the double stroller to the playground near our house, he reminded me that my ambition was still lurking somewhere and told me not to stop working. He took my older son swimming and to the movies while I was in graduate school, and bought the kids extravagant gifts — a trampoline and an electric car — so they would always have something to do in our backyard.If a parent hasn’t always been kind to you, and occasionally seemed intent on destroying you, how do you cope? What do you owe a parent who is mentally ill? Therapy helps, as does befriending people whose parents were also mentally ill (three of my closest friends had suicidal fathers). But what has been most helpful has been meditation, taking notes and focusing on what was good. My father was smart, he taught us to love books and gather information, he made us laugh, he was passionate about his grandsons, and whenever we struggled to remember something that was difficult, he told us to write it down. Now I am, Dad.Image Caption: Laura Zinn Fromm as a child","Latitude means an imaginary line around the earth, room to maneuver, a degree of tolerance of exposure error.I was never the apple of my father’s eye, at least not that I remember, though he took hundreds of black-and-white Polaroids of me as a baby and when I look at them, I see a baby smiling adoringly at the man behind the camera.

159,"https://www.aarpethel.com/lifestyle/flattering-fashion-for-women-who-werent-born-yesterday
",7/6/2021,Flattering Fashion for Women Who Weren’t Born Yesterday,"The equation for fashion that flatters women of a certain age hasn’t changed much since we first wore bell-bottoms. The same colors still look better with some skin tones and hair colors than others. The same dozen fashion personas — Bohemian, romantic, classic — are still rotating trends. And the fashion ABCs — accentuate, balance and camouflage — still prevail.What has changed is us. We may have become paler as we discovered the hazards of the sun. Or darker as we found the joys of gardening, boating or hiking. Our hair color may have changed to a whole different hue. We have become bolder in our style choices and more willing to experiment. We no longer worry about coloring outside the lines, but instead ask ourselves how far out we want to go.“There are no clear lines about what you can and cannot wear at 50, or 60 or even 70,” says Wendy Packer. The 67-year-old California trendsetter focused attention on that topic almost 10 years ago with her groundbreaking Fashion Over Fifty blog and continues the cause on Facebook and Instagram @fashionoverfifty.wendy.“It’s your life, and you get to decide how you want to present yourself.”Women who weren’t born yesterday understand that the more they know themselves, the less they need to care about the “appropriate” rule book.“We’re at that point where we can say, ‘This is who I am. This is the statement I want to make,” says Jan Tuckwood, a 64-year-old journalist who covered fashion in the 1980s. Today, she’s collaborating on the memoir of HSN’s 75-year-old jeans queen, Diane Gilman, who’s sold more than 17 million pairs to home shoppers. “Think of fashion as costume design,” Tuckwood adds, “and you are the character in your movie.”An Honest LookTo truly benefit from the fashion ABCs, we need to be honest with ourselves. How else will we find those physical assets to accentuate, balance or camouflage? Some women have great legs or well-toned arms they can draw attention to. Others will need to create the illusion of longer legs with nude-colored pumps and a curvy kitten heel.“It’s an ideal shape and height for women over 50,” says Packer, “because it elongates without being uncomfortable.” And all of us on the far side of menopause can camouflage a thicker waistline with a belt that adds color and definition.“Balance is all about proportion, like wide palazzo pants with a slimming, wrap top — or a loose, flowing blouse over slim pants,” Tuckwood says. Proportion also applies to the prints you choose. Balance larger hips with a print on top, or wide shoulders with a print on your lower half. Taller women or those with a larger frame can pull off a bigger print that would overwhelm someone more petite.Occasionally there are those shapes that are universally flattering. As prime examples, Tuckwood points to V-necklines and empire waistlines, which hit right below the bust and flow gently to the hem. It’s a forgiving style, she says, that can camouflage a multitude of figure challenges.Fashion’s ABCs are especially relevant when it comes to swimsuits. “There’s no reason a woman over 50 can’t rock a bikini,” says Packer. “Many women have worked out most of their adulthood and maintained a wonderful figure.” In that case, accentuate it. Ditto a voluptuous bust.Camouflage also plays a role. Shirring and ruching — both similar to draping — are popular for swimsuits this season, in part because they hide rolls and bulges. Longer tankini tops offer midriff coverage, too, and can be paired with a skirted bottom to camouflage thighs.The ExtremesAlthough the lines are fuzzy for fashion over 50, there are some hard stops at the extremes — trying too hard and not trying at all.“Women over 50 don’t want to do trendy,” says Packer “There’s no need to change the style you’ve been comfortable with your whole life. You can update it, but you don’t have to change it — unless you want to. The key is to look put together.”At the other end of the spectrum, if you don’t make any effort and simply give everything up for comfort, “you’re sending a message that you don’t care what other people think about you,” says Tuckwood. “There are comfortable clothes that also look like you’re still in the game. If you want to be current, you need to look current. Your clothes can still say now, even if your face says then.”Finding InspirationFor fashion savvy and versatility, Packer’s go-to piece is a blazer. “You can do so much with it,” she says. “You can look very put together by just adding a simple white shirt and jeans. This summer, pastels are big, so that would be an easy update.”She also points to accessories like scarves and quality purses as good options to keep your look current. A pop of color — such as adding a red belt or shoes to a black-and-white outfit — can lend fresh flair. And don’t forget your lip color — it’s an accessory too. “You’re never too old for red lipstick,” says Packer. Over-50 women whose style she appreciates include Maye Musk, Lyn Slater (aka the Accidental Icon), Jennifer Lopez and Angela Bassett — all of whom can be followed on social media for future inspiration.For Tuckwood, inspiration comes with the flip of the TV channel. Like many during the pandemic, she joined the legion of home shoppers and especially appreciates the way HSN and QVC feature models in real-world shapes and sizes.

And you get to pick where you want to be on that scale.”Ultimately, the best advice on flattering fashion for women over 50 is both simple and complex: whatever makes you feel like you.","The equation for fashion that flatters women of a certain age hasn’t changed much since we first wore bell-bottoms. The same colors still look better with some skin tones and hair colors than others. The same dozen fashion personas — Bohemian, romantic, classic — are still rotating trends. And the fashion ABCs — accentuate, balance and camouflage — still prevail.What has changed is us. We may have become paler as we discovered the hazards of the sun. Or darker as we found the joys of gardening, boating or hiking. Our hair color may have changed to a whole different hue. We have become bolder in our style choices and more willing to experiment. We no longer worry about coloring outside the lines, but instead ask ourselves how far out we want to go.“There are no clear lines about what you can and cannot wear at 50, or 60 or even 70,” says Wendy Packer. The 67-year-old California trendsetter focused attention on that topic almost 10 years ago with her groundbreaking Fashion Over Fifty blog and continues the cause on Facebook and Instagram @fashionoverfifty.wendy.“It’s your life, and you get to decide how you want to present yourself.”Women who weren’t born yesterday understand that the more they know themselves, the less they need to care about the “appropriate” rule book.“We’re at that point where we can say, ‘This is who I am. This is the statement I want to make,” says Jan Tuckwood, a 64-year-old journalist who covered fashion in the 1980s. Today, she’s collaborating on the memoir of HSN’s 75-year-old jeans queen, Diane Gilman, who’s sold more than 17 million pairs to home shoppers. “Think of fashion as costume design,” Tuckwood adds, “and you are the character in your movie.”An Honest LookTo truly benefit from the fashion ABCs, we need to be honest with ourselves. How else will we find those physical assets to accentuate, balance or camouflage? Some women have great legs or well-toned arms they can draw attention to. Others will need to create the illusion of longer legs with nude-colored pumps and a curvy kitten heel.“It’s an ideal shape and height for women over 50,” says Packer, “because it elongates without being uncomfortable.” And all of us on the far side of menopause can camouflage a thicker waistline with a belt that adds color and definition.“Balance is all about proportion, like wide palazzo pants with a slimming, wrap top — or a loose, flowing blouse over slim pants,” Tuckwood says. Proportion also applies to the prints you choose. Balance larger hips with a print on top, or wide shoulders with a print on your lower half. Taller women or those with a larger frame can pull off a bigger print that would overwhelm someone more petite.Occasionally there are those shapes that are universally flattering. As prime examples, Tuckwood points to V-necklines and empire waistlines, which hit right below the bust and flow gently to the hem. It’s a forgiving style, she says, that can camouflage a multitude of figure challenges.Fashion’s ABCs are especially relevant when it comes to swimsuits. “There’s no reason a woman over 50 can’t rock a bikini,” says Packer. “Many women have worked out most of their adulthood and maintained a wonderful figure.” In that case, accentuate it. Ditto a voluptuous bust.Camouflage also plays a role. Shirring and ruching — both similar to draping — are popular for swimsuits this season, in part because they hide rolls and bulges. Longer tankini tops offer midriff coverage, too, and can be paired with a skirted bottom to camouflage thighs.The ExtremesAlthough the lines are fuzzy for fashion over 50, there are some hard stops at the extremes — trying too hard and not trying at all.“Women over 50 don’t want to do trendy,” says Packer “There’s no need to change the style you’ve been comfortable with your whole life. You can update it, but you don’t have to change it — unless you want to. The key is to look put together.”At the other end of the spectrum, if you don’t make any effort and simply give everything up for comfort, “you’re sending a message that you don’t care what other people think about you,” says Tuckwood. “There are comfortable clothes that also look like you’re still in the game. If you want to be current, you need to look current. Your clothes can still say now, even if your face says then.”Finding InspirationFor fashion savvy and versatility, Packer’s go-to piece is a blazer. “You can do so much with it,” she says. “You can look very put together by just adding a simple white shirt and jeans. This summer, pastels are big, so that would be an easy update.”She also points to accessories like scarves and quality purses as good options to keep your look current. A pop of color — such as adding a red belt or shoes to a black-and-white outfit — can lend fresh flair. And don’t forget your lip color — it’s an accessory too. “You’re never too old for red lipstick,” says Packer. Over-50 women whose style she appreciates include Maye Musk, Lyn Slater (aka the Accidental Icon), Jennifer Lopez and Angela Bassett — all of whom can be followed on social media for future inspiration.For Tuckwood, inspiration comes with the flip of the TV channel. Like many during the pandemic, she joined the legion of home shoppers and especially appreciates the way HSN and QVC feature models in real-world shapes and sizes. Besides Gilman’s DG2 jeans on HSN, she’s a fan of the bestselling DG2 easy tank. Constructed with a knit back for stretch and comfort, it features tiers of silky polyester in front to disguise tummy bumps.

",12/7/2021,Is Self-Worth Tied to Our Net Worth?,"Imagine if we walked around with price tags hanging around our necks. Even if this sounds ridiculous, in many ways we do it metaphorically.Even the healthiest of us measure our self-worth by external factors like how much we’re paid, the number on the scale or how many times a friend calls. We compare and contrast, especially around status. We’re conditioned to believe that if we have more, we’re worth more.Is this true?From an early age, we want to understand how we fit into the world. We start by learning how to count, classify and behave. We’re told what to care about and even how to think. This is where the seeds of discernment grow into defining who we are and how we value ourselves and others. This is where the worthy muscle starts to flex and where money comes in.“Mom, are we rich?”Most parents face the inevitable question from their child: “Are we rich?” When asked how to answer, I try to offer suggestions knowing that there is no right or wrong or even simple answer. As a child we learn about money at home and through messaging constructed around the paradigm of rich versus poor. Rich is good and poor is bad.Hard work and high pay mean we are smarter, better, stronger.Happiness can be bought. Robert T. Kiyosaki captures this rich versus poor paradigm so effectively inRich Dad Poor Dad,first published in 1997. In it he tells the story of his two dads: his real father, whom he calls his “poor dad,” and the father of his best friend, the man who became his mentor — his “rich dad.”Kiyosaki shares six key lessons for building wealth that combine mindset with practical information, like the definition of an asset versus a liability. He clearly struck a chord with the book — it’s a number one best seller, with over 32 million copies sold in 51 languages and 109 countries. Why? Because he tells us we don’t need to be born rich to become rich. We just need to know what the rich teach their kids about money that the poor and middle class do not. In other words — being rich shouldn’t define us.Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case.My Own Money JourneyAs a child of Depression-era parents, I learned that money was stressful. I also learned that greed was bad, that there was more to life than getting rich, and that I am capable of doing anything if I “put my mind to it.”WhenRich Dad Poor Dadcame out, I inhaled the messages. I was living in a city focused on what you do, juggling a job, raising our young daughters, being a good partner and “doing all the things.” I had always aspired to make more than what I would earn in a job, to be an entrepreneur, and to prove to myself that I have what it takes to be successful. I functioned and continue to function with the idea that if I achieved “x” I would feel satisfied, complete, done.The challenge has been defining that “x” factor and then syncing it up with reality. I’m not great at taking risks. I worry about losing money. I fear failure. And I continue to struggle with my why. Am I proving that I can do this despite these challenges or because of them? Either way, the irony is not lost on me.Either way, I am connecting my self-worth to my net worth.Striving to Measure UpThis striving to measure up and now to meet basic needs like food, housing, and health care has caused financial hardship and stress for so many. It has also created a booming personal finance and self-help industry. In her book,Pound Foolish, Helaine Olen exposes the dark side of the personal finance industry through extensive research and reporting. She even references Kiyosaki, whose company has made millions off selling get-rich-quick courses. (Full disclosure, I sell courses on how to have a positive relationship to money based on all I have learned the hard way.)As parents, we want our kids to be financially independent but can feel limited in our ability to prepare them. We still expect our educational institutions to do the job for us and hope for the best. We pay and pray, saddling ourselves or our children with an average college debt of $32,731 according to the Federal Reserve. Though we don’t want to equate education with social mobility, we do. And the world of work endorses this practice, using measures of degree and performance to determine the value we bring to the table.I’m not saying this is all bad. What I’m saying is that we can easily get caught up in a system that we think defines our self-worth when, in fact, it shouldn’t.Self-Worth and Net Worth Are Measured DifferentlyThe measure of self-worth uses different principles than the measure of net worth. Meadow Devor, my coach and author ofThe Worthy Project,writes, “Worthiness is the quality of deserving attention, energy, and respect. It’s not confidence. It’s not bravado. You can’t fake worthiness, nor can you accidentally end up with it. Worthiness is like a muscle. There are things you can do to strengthen that muscle and there are plenty of things that will weaken it.”Our net worth is a number. It can change like the weather or depend on what country we live in or currency we use.When we focus on our self-worth, we focus on what we need and can offer. We let go of self-doubt. When we do this, we are driven by an inner compass that doesn’t depend on a number to validate our success.A few tips for boosting our self-worth: Look in the mirror each morning and tell yourself at least once — even better, several times — “I am worthy.”Create a list of criteria you have created for yourself to feel worthy. Write it out on a piece of paper and then physically burn it. (Example: I need to lose 10 pounds in order to be loved.) Make a celebration of that moment.Next time you find yourself wanting to buy something to make yourself feel better, put that money into a savings account, take a deep breath and tell yourself how much you love everything about you, even your imperfections. As for our net worth?This can be a powerful tool for measuring our financial health and a practice built around financial literacy, the study of markets, and a willingness to take risks and suffer losses. Even where it is tied to our mental, physical and spiritual health, remember that whatever the price tag, it is just a number and has no bearing on whether you are worthy.","Imagine if we walked around with price tags hanging around our necks.

As a 63-year-old travel blogger and unattached woman, I relish wandering the world — and 2020 was just a temporary stoplight.Until I got two shots in my arm, my biggest excursions were to the bookstore. Now, masks are my makeup, and I know the irritation of swabs poking up my nostrils is momentary.COVID-19 requires extra precautions, research and planning. So be sure to check out any requirements related to the pandemic. But then take the leap, if you can. Traveling solo can fulfill dreams and desires. What destination is beckoning you? Here are some places where flying solo has led to great joy and adventure. Oaxaca, Mexico I’ve been to Mexico dozens of times. Alone. In some places, men swarm aroundgringaslike flies to honey. But Oaxacans are more reserved and respectful. Rich Indigenous heritage and traditions permeate the city’s European architecture and layout, located 285 southeast of Mexico City. Two of Mexico’s best archaeological ruins, Mitla and Monte Alban, are nearby. But the pre-Columbian essence is also vivid at the central market.I pass on most Mexican handcrafts. But Oaxaca’s wares have a distinctive flair. I delight in lightweight Oaxacan ruanas and huipiles. Versatile ruana wraps are 7 feet long and 4 feet wide, split halfway up the middle. My favorites are a rainbow of gemstone hues, woven with narrow strands of yarn. Huipiles are formless Indigenous tops worn by well-known natives like Frida Kahlo. The Oaxacan version I adore is a stark long cotton tunic, wonderfully airy and comfortable. I had a solid cream-colored onethat I dressed up with accessories. While in the market, I pick up a snack or meal. But the quaintfondasare better options for flavorful regional specialties that reflect the spirit of this magical town. Among them are black mole, crunchy cornmealtlayudasand tamales wrapped in banana leaves. Getty Images Istanbul, Turkey Istanbul is otherworldly. Inside magnificent mosques I felt a connection to the divine. Looking out at a sea of domes and minarets or listening to the echoing spiritual chants of the muezzin put me in the clouds. Only a brisk rough rubdown at a Turkish bath brought me back to earth.Istanbul fashion honors both time-honored and trendy, East and West. Women can cover up in an abaya or wear a form-fitting tank top. I have found during my visits that my very American attire did not attract stares.Likewise, my experience is that women can comfortably roam around, alone. Istanbul has many outdoor cafes where you can enjoy dolmas and pomegranate juice, in the sunshine, sitting out on a divan. When I am the only female diner at a restaurant, it doesn’t matter. Getty Images Miami Beach, Florida The Jackie Gleason era is long gone. Miami Beach is a buzzing barrier island filled with rap and reggaeton artists and wannabe and real-life models. Jog, stroll or relax along sandy shores or boardwalks sunrise to sundown. On a rainy day, check out the Art Deco Museum or cross the causeway to the Pérez Art Museum and Frost Museum of Science, situated on a lovely waterfront park.At night, enjoy outdoor dining and endless activity down chic, colorful and eclectic Ocean Drive, Collins Avenue or Lincoln Road. Savor Cuban rice and beans, crispy-fried plantains,a mojito (virgin or traditional),arroz con lecheor flan, and acafé cubano. Pick up fresh empanadas,Colombian arepas,and hamcroquetasfrom a gas station or a windowsill that serves as an outdoor counter.For a leisurely meal, try Moreno’s Cuba for old-style favorites with first-generation twists.

162,"https://www.aarpethel.com/relationships/finding-love-later-in-life-is-possible
",8/7/2020,Finding Love Later in Life Is Possible,"When I met Luis, I’d been divorced for two years. I’d been married for over 20. I’d spent the last quarter of my marriage trying to stitch together a relationship that had clearly torn beyond repair. The scars from a failed pregnancy, challenges with my children, my spouse’s affairs, two careers that didn’t turn out as I’d planned, and a lifetime of triumphs and failures were etched across my face. When I first agreed to go out with Luis, I wondered if he, too, could feel his life story in his aching joints and if he also had gained confidence from the silent wisdom that comes from experience, survival and time.I may have seemed a bit worse for wear, but the truth is that when I started dating the man who would become the second love of my life, I was in my prime. I’d never been better positioned to love myself, and as a result, accept another person for who they are.Luis is five years older than me. He was married twice. His first marriage lasted only a year, and his second wife passed away at too young an age. He has no children, something he regrets, and like me, he never thought he’d find love again after age 50. Remember that 1986 report inNewsweekthat said an older, single woman had a better chance of dying in a terrorist attack than ever getting married again? You’d be amazed how many of us do.

[But] while helping each other lighten your past loads, you get to build something fresh together.""","When I met Luis, I’d been divorced for two years. I’d been married for over 20. I’d spent the last quarter of my marriage trying to stitch together a relationship that had clearly torn beyond repair. The scars from a failed pregnancy, challenges with my children, my spouse’s affairs, two careers that didn’t turn out as I’d planned, and a lifetime of triumphs and failures were etched across my face. When I first agreed to go out with Luis, I wondered if he, too, could feel his life story in his aching joints and if he also had gained confidence from the silent wisdom that comes from experience, survival and time.I may have seemed a bit worse for wear, but the truth is that when I started dating the man who would become the second love of my life, I was in my prime. I’d never been better positioned to love myself, and as a result, accept another person for who they are.Luis is five years older than me. He was married twice. His first marriage lasted only a year, and his second wife passed away at too young an age. He has no children, something he regrets, and like me, he never thought he’d find love again after age 50. Remember that 1986 report inNewsweekthat said an older, single woman had a better chance of dying in a terrorist attack than ever getting married again? You’d be amazed how many of us do. I never saw Luis coming, and I was a total surprise to him, too.When I was dating my husband in my early 20s, I remember trying to be the woman he wanted me to be, and not hesitating to ask him to make major changes.

",8/7/2020,Finding Your Libido: I'm in My 60s and Having the Best Sex of My Life,"I'm 69 going on 25,” is how I describe my current sex life. Go ahead and raise an eyebrow if it suits you, but frankly, I'm having too much fun in the sack to care.Mind you, it wasn't always like this. Like many women my age, my libido diminished mightily at theonset of menopause. As I wrote for The Girlfriend, in my case, it was coupled with my husband having health issues that precluded us from partaking in any “rolls in the hay,” as he once so sweetly called them. The cornucopia of drugs he took brought with them personality changes — and not ones for the better. I had married a teddy bear who was my mate and partner, and now I was a full-time caregiver to an angry, almost unrecognizable patient. And in the process, I lost not just my once active sex life, but any physical affection and romance as well.All of which is to say that by the time I lost my husband to heart and kidney disease, I had spent more years than I like to count being not just celibate, but without the comfort of the physical intimacy that had been the bedrock of our marriage.Hey, it happens. A lot, actually. About20 percent of marriages are sexless. And if you drop in on any online group for spousal caregivers, one of the most frequent refrains is, “Why can't he just hold my hand or say he loves me anymore?""What menopause started, my husband's health problems finished. I went from being an eager and willing lover to the never-never land of a dry and shriveled vagina — and eventually didn't really even care if I never had sex again. I figured it was nature's way of keeping me sane: It's a gift to no longer miss what you no longer can do.I had lost every ounce of sexual desire and I never believed for a minute that it would ever return.Boy, was I ever wrong.Shortly after my husband died, I met the man whose engagement ring I now happily sport on my finger. He also is widowed, and while ourcaregiving pathsfollowed a similar course, we were total strangers when we met on an online dating site. I was there researching a story on romance scams, and he says he was there looking for me.We texted back and forth for a bit, then advanced to phone calls and eventually had an in-real-life date. We clicked — bigly — and we both knew it. But no, we did not rush things. Sex is a big deal for both of us. It signifies a commitment, and we both knew that while we had met someone special, it takes time for a lasting relationship to grow a foundation.And, of course, there was the practical side of starting a sexual relationship when you are in your 60s. We both had HIV/AIDS tests well before they were “necessary.” My gynecologist could barely hide her surprise when I asked her to test me for all the STDs, since I was pretty sure they had discovered a bunch of new ones in the years I wasn't having sex. I left the visit armed with a prescription for an estrogen cream to toughen up the too-thin tissues of my vaginal walls and the suggestion that I experiment with a dildo to see how things felt.Truthfully, things didn't feel so great, and I began to worry whether my body would respond, even with the spirit willing. In the interim, my guy and I spent hours kissing and touching and assuring one another that the relationship would not be derailed by performance issues — mine or his, although I was the only one having them.All in all, I would have to say that my re-entry into a sexual relationship was pretty easy.

",8/7/2020,9 Truths About Later-in-Life Marriage,"My husband, Jonathan, has a receding hairline. I have receding gums. I was 60 when I met him. He was 59. Between us, we have three ex-spouses, three adult children, four deceased parents, nine doctors and dentists, and too many deceased friends.Michael Caine attributes his marital happiness to two bathrooms. Two bathrooms help. So do the following:1.Therapy.As we lingered at my door at the end of our first date, Jonathan told me his age. I mentionedI was a little older. He said he would tell his therapist. On a subsequent date, I asked what made him let me know right away he was in therapy. He said he found it easy to talk to me, assumed I would be pleased and was in or had had therapy, and he thought it was no big deal. Right! Not only no big deal but important and useful for no-big-deal issues. We both believe in therapy, had much before we met and go for booster shots.2. Discussing discomforts and feelings as they arise.Despite our ease together, our marriage requires work — ongoing work. We share what bothers us right away (I do) and calmly (Jonathan does). We don't let things slide except when we should. For example, I am Oscar to Jonathan's Felix. Whether my clutter and piles don't bother him or he knows I'm not tidying up, he doesn't bring up my messiness. But when we feel unheard or erased by each other or by other people, we discuss that and how to deal with it, change it, and protect ourselves and each other. A blessing at our age and stage: We do not feel obliged to oblige family members when it is uncomfortable, and we avoid situations and gatherings that bring discomfort.3. Balancing intimacy and space.I love our time together. I love ourtime apart. Having lived on my own for years and requiring much solitude as a writer and human being, I constantly juggle the two and work on being present where I am. It requires planning, prioritizing, compromise and patience, like all aspects of our relationship. On our 16-day Southwest road trip, with hours of togetherness in the car and at each stop, I took out my laptop and caucused with my muse. Jonathan excused himself for long periods to take pictures. We planned hikes together and walks apart. At home, we juggleindependence and togetherness.4. Self-acceptance.I would not call it self-love; self-acceptance or self-knowledge is more like it. Aging, reflection, therapy, just plain living, meditation, being too tired to beat up on myself, and embracing my quirks, idiosyncrasies and individuality allow me to embrace Jonathan. Maybe it is a chicken-and-egg thing. We get each other. We embrace each other. That helps us to embrace ourselves.5. A sense of humor.My longtime friend Cindy, who had met most if not all of the men I dated, said upon meeting Jonathan, “He laughs at everything you say.” Jonathan appreciates how I see and say it — and vice versa. I saw the twinkle in his eyes right away. My parents were funny. They applauded funny. Cleanliness was hardly next to godliness in my family of origin or in the family I made. A sense of humor was and is on top, getting us through difficulties and pain.6. Compatibility.Our temperaments could not be more different (thank goodness), but our interests, values and food preferences are the same. Family comes first. We both love our work and love to work. We love reading, the theater and Scrabble.7. Chemistry.That inexplicable something was there the first time I saw Jonathan's face. Nothing more to say. Actually, there is, with the next two items.8. Kindness.Jonathan's sex appeal includes kindness. It's in his eyes. Oh, yes! He majored in giving and gives from his heart. I cannot think of a more powerful aphrodisiac than kindness and a generosity of spirit.9. Urgency.The lyric “Enjoy yourself/It's later than you think” is getting louder. Why spend time arguing, being right or proving a point? I am filled with gratitude every day and in every way that, at 60, I found my special someone. As Sinatra sang, “But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of my year.""Yes. And not many seasons to waste.","My husband, Jonathan, has a receding hairline. I have receding gums.

These virtual meetings have provided a sliver of normalcy in this profoundly weird period of our lives. The book club meetings continue to be a few hours in the month we can look forward to, an event we keep on our now empty social calendars.

A newlywed transplant to a coastal town hundreds of miles away from home, I was aching for friends and a sense of community. Through a few missteps attempting to find adult friendships in mismatched volunteer opportunities and snobby running clubs, I stumbled into my book club — a group of mostly stay-at-home moms to young children.They were all a few years older than me, with some closer to my mom's age than mine, and they were all in a life stage that still felt far away to me at 24. My husband and I were still learning how to exist as adults. We mostly felt like college kids playing at house, consuming more beer and ramen than advisable, but now we had real jobs and a mortgage and a crushing sense of responsibility to our four-legged fur baby. My book club friends and their lives of preschool playdates and sleepless nights and aging parents felt oceans away from my reality, and yet, it worked. I felt immediately accepted by these women who were letting me see behind the curtain of adulthood in a way I had never experienced before. I got to study at their feet as we talked candidly about books and babies, husbands and jobs, friendships and families. I spent years soaking it all in. Time, as it is wont to do, passed and soon my designation as the only childless member of our book club came to an end.When I turned down my normal glass of wine, they cheered. They were the first to rally around my pregnancy, they talked me through each fear and worry. They showed up at my door with dinner and baby gifts, welcomed my infant son to meetings and then four years later, returned to my door with handmade quilts to welcome my new baby daughter. They were the ones texting me, asking me what I needed and when was a good time to deliver it.As much as I feel there is immense power in having mom friends who are down in the same diaper and sippy cup trenches you are, having mom friends who are a few years further along in the journey is a gift I never knew I needed. I am the beneficiary of their experiences, and likewise, I am a Padawan they can pour their lessons into, a willing student of everything they've learned the hard way. My book club friends never tried to sell me on motherhood or paint a rosy picture of the future, as a mother or aunt or sister might be tempted to do. Instead, they complained about things worth complaining about, showed me that there was joy and frustration in all of their lives in equal measure. They had no interest in trying to make it seem like they weren't struggling when they were. There was no hiding the hard stuff. They let me down easy, but firmly reminded me that no one has it all figured out and no one is 100 percent happy 100 percent of the time.Real friendship and unbridled conversation with people outside of your own peer group is rare and important.

The past couple of months had been a bit bumpy, with my winding up in the hospital with a severeknee injuryand then on to a subacute physical rehabilitation center. It made me smile when I came home and found out that the coffee place was open, welcoming me home.When the woman rang up my drink, I noticed that she looked me up and down, from head to toe. It both confused and embarrassed me. But I knew that after being so sick, I looked worn out, not just a bit tired. I blushed, thinking I needed to make more of an effort when I left the house to make a good first impression.I picked up my coffee drink at the counter and got into Mom's car. Then I glanced at my receipt.""What's this? I got a senior discount!” I was stunned.""Some places give them,” Mom replied.""Do I look senior discount–ish?” I huffed.Mom laughed. “You're going to be 50 in two weeks. Honey, you look your age.""You can count on Mom to be honest, but that was not the answer I wanted to hear. There are plenty of Hollywoodcelebrities who are 50and look absolutely nothing like it — Halle Berry, Jennifer Lopez and Jennifer Aniston, to name a few. Jane Fonda and Tina Turner are past 50, and has anyone given them a senior discount?I pulled down the mirror from the car's sun visor. I looked for clues. No makeup on. I winced and had to admit there was more gray in my hair than I've noticed before, especially right in the front. A big wrinkle showed in the morning sun. I was casually dressed, wearing a sweatshirt, yoga pants, sneakers and a winter jacket. But I was also walking with a cane and moving more slowly because my knee was still healing. My feelings were hurt, but I had to be fair and admit that if I'd looked at myself for a few seconds, I probably would have given myself a senior discount.""Maybe I should start dying my hair,” I mumbled. I peeled open the straw and stuck it into my iced coffee.A couple of weeks later, I went back to the coffee place. While no one had meant me anything but kindness, I felt like I were facing down a playground bully. I decided I needed to make more of an effort. Perhaps I couldn't look anything like Jennifer Aniston or Jane Fonda, but I could at least wear a bit of lipstick. There are a lot of reasons that no one is offering a Hollywood celebrity a senior discount. Stars always look their best when they walk out their front door! For now, I needed the cane and was still walking slowly.The woman who'd looked me up and down the first time was behind the counter. But this time she didn't seem to pay any extra attention to me. I smiled and ordered my drink. A small, secret thrill went through me when I noticed there was no discount applied to my receipt.""Was everything OK?” Mom asked. Her tone of voice was cheery but with an edge of concern. She knew that my getting the discount had been a harsh wake-up call to being older.""No discount this time,” I grinned.""Well, you're 50. Some places will give you one,” Mom replied.I sipped my coffee. Who was I to turn my nose up at a discount? Now I felt let down. I really did not have extra money. I always clip coupons and shop the sales. That was 30 cents, and if they wanted to give me a special discount because of my age, it should be in my pocket.A few weeks later, I stopped at the coffee place. It was a cold day, and I was craving java. I couldn't resist making a stop while running a couple of errands in the shopping center.A different woman I hadn't seen before took my order and applied the senior discount without looking at me.I just saved 30 cents! I left the store, sipping my coffee, smiling and ready to finish my errands. Saving money was great!Then I stopped. I found myself once again disappointed that I was getting the discount. Couldn't they call senior discounts something else? Maybe a life-experience discount?I was finally walking without the cane. I still had a no-makeup look and hadn't gotten around to dying my hair. I was happy I was getting the senior discount — and then I wasn't! Was this a “senior moment""? I was definitely having a “senior-discount moment""!I remembered when I was a little girl, that excitement of reaching my 10th birthday. Or turning sweet 16. Or being old enough to vote. We must have looked so young, but we felt so grown-up. Getting older used to be something to get excited about. Reaching 50, I was completely outfoxed. Did I want to save 30 cents on my coffee order — or not? Reaching double digits for the first time, I was chock-full of confidence about what came with my new age. Not anymore.I needed a serious attitude adjustment. I was going to be 50, no matter what I did or how much lipstick I applied. Jennifer Aniston was still going to be her, and I was still going to be me. At least I got to keep a bit of extra money in my pocket. While I'd found the entire experience of the discount a real blow to my ego, my coffee order had always been 100 percent accurate and I'd never had to tap my foot, waiting for the baristas to make it. I order decaf joe, and not once have they accidentally caffeinated me.Mom's gift card is still in my purse. It expires in 12 months. Lately, I've been making my coffee at home.

I do.It's just the more you know, the more you stop to think. And now, I think, I think too much.Speaking of which, just when I was certain I'd memorized the shape of my curves, the twist of my hair, the stretch of my skin, it all changed.

Mostly my reflection in the eyes of others. Once a woman achieves the age of 45 or more, it seems you're expected to fade into the woodwork — stop doing whatever you did that made you you. And that you'll never be as attractive or productive as you once were.Have you seen all the tips out there, from beauty to business, on how not to ""give away"" your age? When writing, make sure you don't use two spaces after a period.When corresponding, don't have a Yahoo email address.When cutting your hair, never go shorter in front if it's longer in back, and ...Never, ever wear miniskirts or clothes that are at the height of fashion, or too many accessories. These are not truths. They're arbitrary rules made up by people who want power.So, when we meet in the bathroom, I expect you to tell me the truth.But the truth is, every time we meet, I see her — the girl.The one who danced on the hood of her parents’ car when she was 3;the one who never left home without a roller-skate key tied around a ribbon that hung from her neck;the one who baked cakes by the light of a bulb in an Easy-Bake Oven, hoping to win her father's love.I'm more tranquil now. I have a spot on the couch — a couch I own. It took me decades to let myself be.

",29-06-2020,Why We Should Celebrate the Joys of Menopause,"When I started perimenopause, a good friend 10 years older gave me some great advice. She said, “Don't read any of those books on thesymptoms of menopause. That stuff can get into your head, and those bad experiences can then become yours.""She added, “I refused to read any of it, and I sailed through menopause with very little discomfort.” Really? Could that work? Could the dreaded “change” be easy? I trusted her because she is someone who not only believes her thoughts create her reality but also proves it daily.So, as my periods became further and further apart and eventually stopped altogether, I was hopeful. I didn't read the books, I avoided the articles, and I was blissfully ignorant.Then, I was struck with hot flashes. NOOOOOO!!! WHYYYYYY??? I was going to create this menopause experience like my wise friend — so what happened? I was miffed. I looked up how long hot flashes last and discovered it could be anywhere from one to 10 years! No way!I was determined to do this differently. I decided to change my thinking and stop focusing on the hot flashes, and I began focusing on the positive aspects of menopause instead. I am here to tell you, there are actually a lot of positives if you start looking for them.First, those rumors about your libido lowering and your vagina drying up are not every woman's experience. In fact, when I turned 50, my libido was at an all-time high, and my vagina was functioning perfectly. I have now gone over a year without having a period and am still having, at almost 53, the best sex of my life. Not even kidding.Secondly, I stopped focusing on all my perceived flaws. I looked at myself naked in the mirror, channeled my inner goddess and thought: Sure, you've had two children, you've got some laugh lines, your breasts are lower and your skin isn't as taut — but you still have it going on!As it turns out, confidence at any age is very alluring. I was flirted with by people of every age group and every gender, and at the height of my newfound self-confidence, I attracted my partner. He was three years younger, and I couldn't get enough of him. Our relationship was a new opportunity to really own my sexuality as the 50-year-old, sexy, self-confident woman that I had become. And one of the first lessons was learning to own my 50-year-old sexual self.I also learned to surrender to change — and I do mean all change. I stopped resisting. It turns out, I am not an anomaly. I have many friends in their 50s and 60s, single and married, who are having great sex and have sailed through menopause. It's not as uncommon as you may have been led to believe. I'm happy to report that there is much to be joyful about during menopause.I didn't have to worry about birth control anymore or having messy period sex or abstaining from sex until my period was over. I wasn't achy, tired and moody every month. I have not gained a lot of weight, and I feel great.And those pesky hot flashes? Well, I still have them. And yes, they are still annoying — especially when one occurs right in the middle of sex. But you know what? My man throws back the covers and admires my shimmering body while he waits patiently for it to pass. It's an actual turn-on, not a mood killer.They often refer to menopause as “The Change,” so let's start changing the story. Let's start empowering women by telling empowering stories about the joys of menopause. Let's talk about how your thoughts can create your reality and change the entire menopausal experience, because what we focus on always gets bigger.Let's tell a joyful story of self-acceptance, love and freedom, an embracing of our divine sexuality as we've never done before. This has been my experience, and it can be yours as well.Let's make “The Change” a beautiful rite of passage, because change can be good and there isn't any way to prevent change from happening anyway. As for those annoying hot flashes: I sleep naked ... with a fan on … and have joyfully surrendered.","When I started perimenopause, a good friend 10 years older gave me some great advice.

",9/7/2020,The Purchase That Made Me Feel Like a Woman,"Once upon a time,I believed that a piece of furniture could save my marriage. My then husband and I were struggling. We had two children under the age of 2, two jobs in imploding industries and one serious breach of trust. Hoping a date night would help, we booked a sitter and went to see the Irish indie movie Once. We reached out for each other's hands and wept in the dark as we watched the sad love story. Afterward, we were still holding hands, but not speaking much, as we strolled through a Swedish antiques store near the theater. A rustic blue sideboard stopped us in our tracks. We nodded at each other, both in perfect agreement that the weathered beauty was “us.” Despite the wince-inducing price tag and the fact that we really didn't need the piece, we deployed our credit card. The mutual decision felt less like a spontaneous splurge than a last-ditch down payment on our future together.Two years later, my husband moved out. The marriage was over, and I was overwhelmed with grief. In a manic, trying-to-make-everything-better fit of creativity, I decided to paint my dining-room walls peach and the formal brown dining-room set (that I had inherited from my grandparents) the same weathered blue as the sideboard. The painter thought I was unhinged, but I was desperate for light and bright any way I could get it. Color was my DIY attempt to banish the darkness that was pervading my life.The blue table, it turned out, was a hit. Guests often remarked on the cheerful effect the unusual hue had on the dining-room set's formal lines. Gamely moving forward in my single life, I hosted festive girls-night-in dinner parties as well as an annual Christmas Eve bash for 20. I had fun dressing up the table with formal china and down with boho, Indian place mats and votive candles. Always, my tableau had fresh flowers, which perked up the whole house.After 12 years, however, the blue table was showing its age. The chipped paint started to lose its charm and simply appeared dirty, especially through my eyes when newcomers came to my home. Looking at all of its dings, I couldn't help but recall my own battle scars. I had to do something.I cruised Pinterest, looking for inspiration. I pinned teal and cobalt in high gloss, thinking funky and vintage would change it up. But by the time I added up materials and labor, I figured I might as well invest in something new. Anthropologie was having its 40 percent–off tag sale. I found a 110-inch white-washed wooden table and end chairs with elaborately carved owls that could mix and match with my current seats. Excitedly, I sent the links to my decorator friends Kevin and Neal for their approval.""I'd get sick of that look after a while,” Neal replied.""Go classic; you'll have it a lifetime,” Kevin said.Not the reaction I was expecting, but I respect their taste so I asked myself, was I really ready to go traditional? Brown seemed so adult, so end of the line. I suddenly started to feel like my mother.Retail was out of the question, so I perused a website for local estate sales. The first sale I clicked on just happened to have a formal dining-room set—billed as Baker's Historic Charleston Collection—with 10 chairs and a matching credenza. Even secondhand, the set was way out of my price range, but it was handsome.I texted Kevin and Neal the screenshots.""Looks like Grandma's going to the home,” Kevin observed. “Lucky for you she had good taste. Let's check it out.”Kevin and Neal met me at the sale first thing Sunday morning. As luck would have it, the furniture was still available and also half-price, because it was the final day of the sale. We sat ourselves down on the Chippendale-style chairs and admired the mahogany table's contrasting banded satinwood inlay. The color wasn't boring but rich and brindled, like the coat of a thoroughbred horse. Neal pointed out the entertaining I could do with the three 16-inch leaves.""Nice feet,” Kevin added, as he inspected the foliate-accented columnar pedestals. I imagined Ina Garten placing a silver pitcher of bloody Marys on the semicircle matching crendenza. Then I imagined my money manager pursing his lips. In some ways this decision would be nothing short of reckless. Just over a year ago I had put my house on the market and taken a nonprofit job that paid a fraction of my previous one. This purchase would mean I was staying put in the house and not keeping my options open to downsize.Neal googled the retail value. “This is estimated to be a $40,000 set,” he murmured to me.I'm a sucker for a good deal. I got the seller down even further, and the next thing I knew, I was freecycling my chipped blue furniture, sweeping away dust bunnies and making way for the mahogany.Unlike the blue Swedish sideboard, this decision did feel like a spontaneous splurge. I wasn't trying to tether what was but, rather, planning for what could be. Granting myself the upgrade made me feel giddy. I love beautiful things, and I love to share them. If not now, when?Within a week I hosted an impromptu dinner party. As friends and family sat around the gleaming table, passing roast chicken and pouring sauvignon blanc, I sat back to admire the elegant, candle-lit scene and smiled. Furniture may not be able to save a marriage, but it sure was making me feel like a full-on woman.","Once upon a time,I believed that a piece of furniture could save my marriage.

Looking at all of its dings, I couldn't help but recall my own battle scars. I had to do something.I cruised Pinterest, looking for inspiration. I pinned teal and cobalt in high gloss, thinking funky and vintage would change it up. But by the time I added up materials and labor, I figured I might as well invest in something new. Anthropologie was having its 40 percent–off tag sale. I found a 110-inch white-washed wooden table and end chairs with elaborately carved owls that could mix and match with my current seats. Excitedly, I sent the links to my decorator friends Kevin and Neal for their approval.""I'd get sick of that look after a while,” Neal replied.""Go classic; you'll have it a lifetime,” Kevin said.Not the reaction I was expecting, but I respect their taste so I asked myself, was I really ready to go traditional? Brown seemed so adult, so end of the line. I suddenly started to feel like my mother.Retail was out of the question, so I perused a website for local estate sales. The first sale I clicked on just happened to have a formal dining-room set—billed as Baker's Historic Charleston Collection—with 10 chairs and a matching credenza. Even secondhand, the set was way out of my price range, but it was handsome.I texted Kevin and Neal the screenshots.""Looks like Grandma's going to the home,” Kevin observed. “Lucky for you she had good taste. Let's check it out.”Kevin and Neal met me at the sale first thing Sunday morning. As luck would have it, the furniture was still available and also half-price, because it was the final day of the sale. We sat ourselves down on the Chippendale-style chairs and admired the mahogany table's contrasting banded satinwood inlay. The color wasn't boring but rich and brindled, like the coat of a thoroughbred horse. Neal pointed out the entertaining I could do with the three 16-inch leaves.""Nice feet,” Kevin added, as he inspected the foliate-accented columnar pedestals. I imagined Ina Garten placing a silver pitcher of bloody Marys on the semicircle matching crendenza. Then I imagined my money manager pursing his lips. In some ways this decision would be nothing short of reckless. Just over a year ago I had put my house on the market and taken a nonprofit job that paid a fraction of my previous one. This purchase would mean I was staying put in the house and not keeping my options open to downsize.Neal googled the retail value. “This is estimated to be a $40,000 set,” he murmured to me.I'm a sucker for a good deal. I got the seller down even further, and the next thing I knew, I was freecycling my chipped blue furniture, sweeping away dust bunnies and making way for the mahogany.Unlike the blue Swedish sideboard, this decision did feel like a spontaneous splurge. I wasn't trying to tether what was but, rather, planning for what could be. Granting myself the upgrade made me feel giddy. I love beautiful things, and I love to share them. If not now, when?Within a week I hosted an impromptu dinner party. As friends and family sat around the gleaming table, passing roast chicken and pouring sauvignon blanc, I sat back to admire the elegant, candle-lit scene and smiled. Furniture may not be able to save a marriage, but it sure was making me feel like a full-on woman."

",8/7/2020,I Lost My Engagement Ring: Why Am I So Upset?,"When I was 3, my best friend was Ellen G. We lived down the hall from each other in an apartment building on Staten Island. I loved Ellen so much that I hoped we would get married some day. I used to trace my left hand, draw a large diamond ring on the ring finger, then draw pictures of Ellen and me on our wedding day (I was the bride in a veil and dress, Ellen the groom in a bow tie and pants.)Flash forward 50 years. Ellen and I married other people. I have no idea if she got a traditional engagement ring, but I did, and it looked a lot like the ring I had drawn as a kid. I wear my engagement ring every day but other than automatically turning it around on the subway, I can’t remember the last time I looked at it, never mind cleaned it. So imagine my surprise when shortly after my younger son and I went on his first college visit, I mechanically went to turn the ring around, and was pricked by a prong. When had my ring become so sharp? I looked down. There was no stone! It had fallen out in New York City. We had taken two subways and walked for hours. There was no point in retracing ours steps. The stone was gone.I was amazed at how much I suddenly missed something I had barely paid attention to. I told my husband, who emailed the insurance company. The insurance adjuster pleasantly instructed me to get an estimate of how much it would cost to replace it and gave me a budget. I didn’t have to show proof of purchase, or details of what had been lost (a good thing, since we had lost the paperwork). The thought of having so much freedom was liberating but terrifying. What did I actually want from an engagement ring at age 54? What trappings of marriage did I still need or want?I only knew of one other person who had lost her diamond solitaire: My close friend’s stone had fallen out shortly after she was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer. How could the universe be so cruel to one person, I thought, when she flashed her empty setting. I thought of other friends who had replaced their engagement rings or stopped wearing them altogether. One’s husband had an affair, and though they had reconciled, she stopped wearing rings on her left hand. Another’s husband had had a baby with another woman, and she sold off her engagement ring after they got divorced. A diamond ring represented commitment, beauty and hope, yes, but could quickly become something fungible when the commitment evaporated.I had no illusions that marriage was a sunny picnic; it was more like a sweaty marathon. My parents had had five marriages and two engagements between them. My mother had worn three engagement rings and had strong feelings on what mine should look like: diamond solitaire, traditional Tiffany setting. My fiancé and I went to the diamond district and bought mine with cash. I wore my engagement ring proudly, happy to broadcast my love for my fiancé, though as a young Business Week reporter, I also knew that it might make me look materialistic, retrograde and ridiculous. Twenty-five years later, what did an engagement ring symbolize? Commitment? Vanity? Love of fine jewelry? My husband said he would weigh in after I had made a decision. I texted friends who knew jewelers, then took the subway down to meet one on West 47th Street. I tried on traditional rings with diamonds and baguettes, then spotted a bright emerald in the window. It was huge, green and flashy. It said, “I’m the queen!” It also said, “Mug me!” I asked how much it was. It was actually less than the insurance company was willing to give me. I went online and read about the emerald. “In modern times, it is said to help those who suffer from depression or other mental or emotional disorders.” Depression runs in my family; maybe the emerald would fend it off. “An emerald is one of the few [gemstones] that symbolically cover a broad range of life’s experiences and milestones, making it a good choice for reaffirming a strong relationship.” My husband and I do have a strong relationship. We drive each other crazy sometimes, but after seeing the wreckage of some of my friends’ and parents’ marriages, I know what we have is pretty solid.I texted the husband of my friend whose diamond had fallen out, while she was being treated for colon cancer, and asked if she had replaced the stone. He texted back: “She did not primarily because she felt in her condition it made no sense to her.”I continue to wear my engagement ring, without the stone. The prongs stick me and catch on my sweaters. My husband calls it, “an engagement weapon.” The setting looks empty and says loudly, “Something has been lost.” I remind myself it is only a stone.There is a coda to this story, one that is not so somber or philosophical, and has more to do with good luck than good sense. After concluding that the diamond had found a new home in a Manhattan sewer or the dark crevasses of a subway track, I sat down at our kitchen table to pay bills. I needed energy to plow through them and started eating from a box of stale yellow raisins. As I was mindlessly typing out amounts to be paid to PSEG and the snowplow guy, my tooth bit down on something hard. “Oh no,” I thought. “My tooth fell out.” Either that, or this was a ridiculously stale raisin. I put my fingers into my mouth, and out came my diamond, bright, shiny and happy to see me. I sat there in shock, then realized I had dug into the same box of raisins a week before, using the raisins to propel me through some editing work. The diamond must have fallen into the box then.I once dated a guy who said to me, “I’d rather be lucky than smart.” I had been trying so hard to be smart about losing something that had once meant a great deal to me, and felt lucky as hell to have found it again.","When I was 3, my best friend was Ellen G.
