F.A.S.T. Track, a Funding Accelerator for Seniors Transportation, arises out of a desperate need to create forward-thinking transportation solutions for older Canadians. Many seniors in Canada don’t have access to public transit and, of those who do have access, fewer than 6% are able to use it. Through a cross-country call to communities large and small,F.A.S.T. Trackseeks to identify the service gaps that limit how older people get around, as well as identify innovative solutions to fill those gaps. “Lack of appropriate transportation options is a critical concern for Canada’s fastest-growing demographic”, says Gregor Sneddon, Executive Director of HelpAge Canada. “Older people who can’t get around easily suffer isolation and loneliness—primary barriers to physical and mental health, as well as quality of life.F.A.S.T. Trackwill accelerate the launch of innovative transportation solutions for seniors across Canada.” F.A.S.T. Track will be delivered by leading national non-profit organizations in collaboration with thought-leaders and experts in the fields of aging and transportation, including CanAge: Canada’s National Seniors Advocacy Organization. “Transportation is the key to a vibrant, healthy and connected life. Without adequate transportation seniors can’t get to clubs, activities, doctors or families. There is just no point in creating services that people can’t get to” says Ms. Tamblyn Watts. “This innovative project tackles this problem head-on.” F.A.S.T. Tracktransportation expert Aislin O’Hara warns “Canada can no longer approach the lack of seniors’ transportation through patchwork or ad-hoc projects. This leaves many communities a transportation desert for older Canadians in a super-aging country.” Who can participate inF.A.S.T. Track? Transportation providers of all types, sizes and systems, and those who provide various supports to seniors transportation in Canada, are invited to build their community profile atfasttrackcanada.org. Respondents will answer questions about the current services that are available in their community, and will be asked to identify what gaps and barriers exist. Those interested in testing or scaling an innovative transportation solution in their community, are encouraged to apply for a national innovation award. Winners will be announced during the first-ever National Conference on Seniors Transportation; a dynamic online knowledge exchange event in April, 2022. Winning submissions will receive national recognition, a cash prize of $5,000, a consultation package to refine their solution, and the potential to connect with funders who can make these innovations a reality for seniors. “We know there is already great work being done at the local levels. The goal ofF.A.S.T. Trackis to give the sector something it has never seen before: a national snapshot of the gaps in seniors transportation and a menu of identified innovative solutions that can be replicated and scaled,” says Sneddon. “We can’t do it alone. Communities know their needs best—we need all parties at the table.” Submissions are currently being accepted online atfasttrackcanada.org.

In recent weeks, we have awakened to the knowledge that seniors face serious barriers to participating in communities and their experience of quarantine has created inhumane conditions for many, often facing the palliative journey alone.HelpAge Canada and Connected Canadians are collaborating on two new technology programs for older Canadians to give them access and support. TheSeniors Can Connect!programs are designed to help seniors across Canada connect with loved ones and communities with the help of technology.Seniors Can Connect! Toll-Free Technology Support HotlineThis hotline provides free training and support for seniors on the devices they currently own. Volunteer technical mentors, who work in multiple languages, are trained to provide IT support and call center assistance to seniors. (This program will be launched initially in Ontario and Eastern Quebec.)Seniors Can Connect! Tablet Lending ProgramThis program loans communication devices, such as tablets, to Canadian seniors who otherwise would not have access to them. These devices allow seniors to communicate with their loved ones and the outside world. (Currently, we work with local community partners in the Ottawa area.)“Senior isolation and loneliness is a crippling reality that the Seniors Can Connect! Program faces straight on by connecting older people to their loved ones, their community and providing access to the world. All people need to know they are loved and belong.”Gregor Sneddon, Executive Director, HelpAge Canada.Connected Canadiansis a federally incorporated non-profit organization based in Ottawa, with a mandate to connect older adults with free technology training and support. Many Connected Canadians volunteers are new Canadians who are highly skilled technology workers who, collectively, speak 12 languages. Volunteers benefit from the cultural awareness and conversational practice opportunities that come from their interaction with clients, and clients feel a sense of pride and connection in helping to welcome newcomers into the community.“Although technology with no human connection offers little, technology that’s used to directly enable human connections can make a world of difference—especially to those enduring isolation and loneliness. That’s why all Connected Canadians’ programming has improved human connection as it’s driving force.

States may not have started drafting a new UN convention yet, but they are doing the groundwork and moving ever closer to the time when they will.Support for a new UN convention continues to grow in different regions of the world. Canada, which was previously opposed, stated that it is now open to discussing the idea of a new convention. Mauritius became the latest African state to express its support, saying a legally binding instrument may eventually ensure the rights of older people are guaranteed.Civil society presence was stronger and better co-ordinated than ever. A record 42 NGOs applied for accreditation to the OEWG to participate directly in the process, and all 42 were approved.A statement from the Global Alliance for the Rights of Older People, a network of 266 civil society organisations, said: “With each session of the working group, the case for a new international instrument is further legitimised through strong evidence. However, this debate cannot go on indefinitely without a concrete outcome.”Despite the progress, there is a lot of work to do. Older people’s self-representation at the OEWG is still limited. They need to be at the heart of the discussions and lead the advocacy on their rights to ensure that a UN convention reflects their experiences and needs. More government representatives with expertise in the issues need to attend the OEWG to ensure the state interventions are well-informed. And member states must agree to allocate sufficient resources from the UN budget so the OEWG can effectively carry out its work.Looking ahead, two new topics were chosen for the 10th OEWG in 2019: the rights to social protection and to education. Work between sessions is already planned, with international conferences on the rights of older people being held in Seoul, South Korea in September and Vienna, Austria in November.As Vanda Ou, an older woman and member of an older people’s association in Cambodia said: “We wish to be treated equally and have access to the same opportunities we had when we were young. We strongly hope to have a UN convention on the rights of older people in the very near future.”Find out more about the process of working towards a UN convention on older people’s rights.

On the agenda was a report on the progress made in implementing theGlobal Strategy and Action Plan on Ageing and Health (GSAP), which was adopted when I last attended the WHA two years ago. And while there is much to be positive about, many challenges remain.The WHO Ageing and Lifecourse Department’smid-term reportdetails progress against 10 key indicators of the GSAP, and it includes some promising developments:112 countries have a national focal point on ageing and health.45% of countries have a national policy on ageing and health.88 countries have national legislation and enforcement mechanisms against age-based discrimination.Importantly, the report also provides a baseline from which to measure further progress in the remaining three years of the strategy and beyond to theWHO’s decade of action on healthy ageing.In the session on the strategy, I highlighted some of the work HelpAge has been doing over the last two years in support of the healthy ageing agenda:Our work on national strategy development in Ethiopia and Zimbabwe to change the policy environment.Our health worker training on older people’s health in Lebanon that is helping staff be better attuned to older men’s and women’s needs.Our work with the Asian Development Bank to strengthen long-term care systems in six countries in the region.How we are consulting older people on the aims of a global campaign to combat ageism, which will ensure their voices are at the front and centre.How do older people fit into the WHO’s five-year strategy?Among the headline topics for discussion this year was the adoption of theWHO’s 13th General Programme of Work. This will guide what the WHO does over the next five years, and is the first developed under Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who was appointed last year.Early drafts of the strategy failed to include older people, or to highlight the changes needed within health systems to ensure an adequate response to population ageing. Reassuringly, the version adopted at the WHA was much improved. It commits to supporting efforts to achieve healthy ageing, aligning with the strategic objectives in the GSAP, and positions healthy ageing as central to universal health coverage.HelpAge International congratulates WHO on its progress, but we believe there needs to be greater ambition in the impact framework. Unlike theSustainable Development Goals, the framework includes age-exclusive indicators on violence against women and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), proposing only collecting data up to age 49 and 70 respectively, which would leave many older people invisible.Is there an acceptable age at which to die?WHO’s narrow age-bracketed focus has been an ongoing concern for HelpAge for many years and our concerns were not allayed by discussions during the NCDs session at the WHA.The Director-General’s report for the agenda item on the preparation for the Third United Nations High-Level Meeting on NCDs later this year heavily focused on “premature mortality” and reducing deaths from NCDs among people aged 30-70.This narrow focus risks excluding people over and under this age, and the language of “premature mortality” suggests there is an age at which it is acceptable to die. It is discriminatory, could lead to unequal service access, and gives space for ageism within health systems. There are real impacts of this approach. In the UK, women are only routinely called for screening for breast cancer up to the age of 70, despite athird of cases of breast cancer occurring in women over this age.The impact of this rhetoric was clear during the discussions. Close to 60% of deaths from NCDs occur in people aged 70 and over, yet I only heard one member state make the link between ageing and NCDs, while a large proportion talked about premature mortality. Responding to this issue, HelpAge’s statement strongly urged the WHO and member states to move away from this discriminatory, narrow focus and instead to recognise people’s right to health across the lifecourse.Championing assistive technologyTo end on a more positive note, there was one final WHA session in ageing came through loud and clear. It saw member states adopt aresolution on improving access to assistive technology, such as walking frames, glasses and pill dispensers. It makes explicit reference to the link between population ageing and the increasing need for assistive technology, and many member states, including Pakistan, Ecuador, Bhutan, Japan and Israel, reiterated this point.The WHO will be continuing its work to roll out a new priority list of assistive technologies and HelpAge is happy to be partnering with them on this initiative. The resolution also provides a good foundation to build at the UK Department for International Development’s upcoming summit on disability, which will have a focus on assistive technology, and, we hope, ageing and older people.At the end of a long week in Geneva, I left this year’s WHA feeling positive on some fronts, but very aware of the challenges we still face. With a commitment from WHO to “walk the talk”, I hope this will extend to the full inclusion of ageing and older people in global health initiatives to achieve a world in which we can all live a long and healthy life.Find out more about ourhealth workand followRachel Albone on Twitter.

","By Ben SmallUp to 14 million older people with disabilities are currently affected by humanitarian emergencies and, even though they are among the most at risk, a new study reveals how they routinely face barriers that limit their access to assistance and protection.Missing millions: how older people with disabilities are excluded from humanitarian responseis launched today (30 April) by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and HelpAge International.Although there is increasingly a focus on including older people and people with disabilities in humanitarian efforts, the study found that people who are both older and disabled risk having their rights to safe and dignified assistance and protection denied.The study drew upon a comprehensive literature review, data analysis, and interviews with older people affected by crises inTanzaniaand Ukraine. It reveals how older people with disabilities fared worse than those without disabilities, and how this is related to various physical and institutional barriers, as well as hostile attitudes.Data analysis revealed that between 7.8 and 13.7 million older people with disabilities are currently affected by humanitarian crises. It showed that these people, compared to older people without disabilities, are more likely to have been out of work, have a serious health problem, spend more than a quarter of their income on healthcare, be unable to participate in community life, and rate their quality of life as poor.A person’s capacity to survive a humanitarian crisis correlates with their health and financial status. Those with money and good health are better able to escape and live elsewhere than those who have little money and poor health.The literature review reflected this, showing how older people with disabilities were at greater risk of being left behind during emergencies in Ethiopia, Japan, Syria and USA. For those who do escape, older people with disabilities face barriers in accessing information and services, and they are more likely to be affected psychologically by crises.Humanitarian responders often require recipients to collect aid or social protection payments in person, and that it can be difficult or impossible across long distances and tough terrain without transportation.A 100-year-old woman who fled Burundi to camps in Tanzania who was interviewed for the study said: “It’s difficult for me to carry my food ration because of my poor health and my disabilities.”Some older people with disabilities were humiliated by the negative attitudes of staff, and even told to leave the camp by younger people. Those interviewed in Tanzania said they felt forgotten about because of their age, and in Ukraine they felt vulnerable to theft when collecting their pensions.“Our research showed that older people with disabilities are at greater risk of poverty and more likely to have health problems that require costly medication. Yet they are rarely included in livelihoods programmes and activities that would offer opportunities to work and earn money, despite expressing a desire to do so,” said Dr Sarah Polack, Associate Professor at LSHTM’s International Centre for Evidence in Disability.A 90-year-old woman in Tanzania said: “I feel sad that I can’t do the things I did before. I used to cultivate some land and be independent, but I can’t do that now. I used to have visitors and manage to give them something, but not anymore. I can’t do anything. This upsets me a lot.”Homes, public facilities and toilets are typically not accessible, and lack wheelchair ramps, handrails and other low-cost adaptations that can make a big difference. This can leave older people with disabilities socially isolated, housebound and deprived of their dignity, threatening their mental health at a time when conflict, disaster and insecurity has already impacted on their emotional wellbeing.An 87-year-old man in eastern Ukraine said: “My wife stayed in the basement all the time. I used to go outside sometimes, but she couldn’t go out because of the stairs. It affected her a lot.”These barriers marginalise older people with disabilities and threaten their rights to independence, dignity and participation.“For too long, older people with disabilities have been invisible in humanitarian responses, their fundamental human rights denied,” said Madeleine McGivern, Global Humanitarian Advocacy Adviser at HelpAge International.“This must change. Barriers to accessing assistance and protection need to be removed, and the voices of older people with disabilities must be heard so that humanitarian responses meet their needs.”What can be done to support the rights of older people with disabilities in humanitarian crises?The study advocates that donors, policy makers and humanitarian responders demonstrate leadership and commitment to ensure older people with disabilities are always included. Recommendations include:using theHumanitarian Inclusion Standards for Older People and People with Disabilities, and ensuring senior staff take responsibility to include these groupscollecting data fully disaggregated by sex, age and disability, and only funding programmes that meet this standardrecognising the right and capabilities of older people with disabilities, and consulting and including them at all agesinvesting in tackling age and disability discrimination, and giving older people with disabilities a voicesupporting NGOs, state welfare departments and healthcare providers to make services and distributions inclusive and accessible.Download theMissing millionsfull report,executive summary,posterand viewan infographic exploring the findings.

A 100-year-old woman who fled Burundi to camps in Tanzania who was interviewed for the study said: “It’s difficult for me to carry my food ration because of my poor health and my disabilities.” Some older people with disabilities were humiliated by the negative attitudes of staff, and even told to leave the camp by younger people. Those interviewed in Tanzania said they felt forgotten about because of their age, and in Ukraine they felt vulnerable to theft when collecting their pensions. “Our research showed that older people with disabilities are at greater risk of poverty and more likely to have health problems that require costly medication. Yet they are rarely included in livelihoods programmes and activities that would offer opportunities to work and earn money, despite expressing a desire to do so,” said Dr Sarah Polack, Associate Professor at LSHTM’s International Centre for Evidence in Disability. A 90-year-old woman in Tanzania said: “I feel sad that I can’t do the things I did before. I used to cultivate some land and be independent, but I can’t do that now. I used to have visitors and manage to give them something, but not anymore. I can’t do anything. This upsets me a lot.” Homes, public facilities and toilets are typically not accessible, and lack wheelchair ramps, handrails and other low-cost adaptations that can make a big difference. This can leave older people with disabilities socially isolated, housebound and deprived of their dignity, threatening their mental health at a time when conflict, disaster and insecurity has already impacted on their emotional wellbeing. An 87-year-old man in eastern Ukraine said: “My wife stayed in the basement all the time. I used to go outside sometimes, but she couldn’t go out because of the stairs. It affected her a lot.” These barriers marginalise older people with disabilities and threaten their rights to independence, dignity and participation. “For too long, older people with disabilities have been invisible in humanitarian responses, their fundamental human rights denied,” said Madeleine McGivern, Global Humanitarian Advocacy Adviser at HelpAge International. “This must change. Barriers to accessing assistance and protection need to be removed, and the voices of older people with disabilities must be heard so that humanitarian responses meet their needs.” The study advocates that donors, policy makers and humanitarian responders demonstrate leadership and commitment to ensure older people with disabilities are always included.

It reveals how older people with disabilities fared worse than those without disabilities, and how this is related to various physical and institutional barriers, as well as hostile attitudes.Data analysis revealed that between 7.8 and 13.7 million older people with disabilities are currently affected by humanitarian crises. It showed that these people, compared to older people without disabilities, are more likely to have been out of work, have a serious health problem, spend more than a quarter of their income on healthcare, be unable to participate in community life, and rate their quality of life as poor.A person’s capacity to survive a humanitarian crisis correlates with their health and financial status. Those with money and good health are better able to escape and live elsewhere than those who have little money and poor health.The literature review reflected this, showing how older people with disabilities were at greater risk of being left behind during emergencies in Ethiopia, Japan, Syria and USA.

In Canada alone, more than one million seniors suffer from social isolation, and many more experience loneliness. These two afflictions are not to be taken lightly, as they can often lead to the deterioration of a person’s physical or mental health, as well as increase the risk of suffering psychological or physical abuse.As one of the founding organisations of the HelpAge International network, which advocates to fight ageism and defend the rights of older persons, HelpAge Canada has long been focused on the issue of social isolation and loneliness. As pernicious as these problems may be, we have the power to stop them in their tracks. By reaching out and making the seniors close to us a part of our lives, we help brighten not only their days, but ours as well.That’s why we launched theRISE campaign(Reach Isolated Seniors Everywhere). Our goal is to encourage Canadians of all ages to address loneliness and social isolation. Since the change of seasons can leave older persons feeling depressed, we invite Canadians to take action onRISE Sundayand connect with a senior they know by reaching out to them with an act of kindness or a phone call.

It is the only international index that ranks countries according to the social and economic well-being of their older people. This year Canada ranks 5th, down from 4th place in 2014. With an overall score of 84/100, Canada follows Switzerland, Norway, Sweden and Germany.Using reliable international data sets, the Index provides comparative data on 96 countries, representing 790 million people (91% of those 60+). As well as providing an overall country ranking, the Global AgeWatch Index measures four indicators that have been identified by older persons themselves as key enablers of their wellbeing. Canada ranks 10thth in income security, 4th in health status, 10th in capabilities (employment and education), and 9th in enabling environment. According to HelpAge Canada Chair, Amy Westland, “While it is very positive that Canada ranks fourth on seniors’ well-being, we must not be complacent. Our aging population is fast becoming a pressing issue that challenges us all – as individuals, communities, businesses, and as governments. We must continue to work together to address the issues that Canadian seniors face daily in this country, including poverty, elder abuse and social isolation, and to do what we can to provide assistance to older persons in need in other parts of the world.” HelpAge International’s Global AgeWatch Index ranks countries by how well their aging populations are faring. The purpose of the Global AgeWatch Index is to: monitor the well-being of older people across the world Identify and track key trends on aging at country, regional and global levels. provide a framework for governments and international institutions on key data needed to develop policy related to population aging. The Index tells us that economic growth alone will not improve older people’s well-being and that all countries need to put specific policies in place to address the many implications of aging.
