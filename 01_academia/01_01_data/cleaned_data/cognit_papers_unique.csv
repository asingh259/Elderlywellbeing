0,'What Matters' - A digital solution to support person-centered care for people with dementia in care settings ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/232601,"Canada's aging population and the increasing prevalence of dementia has a significant and growing impact. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the risk of older people with dementia living in long-term care homes and hospital settings. Social isolation and loneliness are pressing concerns in senior care. The research purpose is to develop and evaluate a mobile app - WhatMatters to address the urgent need for social isolation. We will involve students in nursing, computer science and health design, patient and family partners, frontline staff, and decision-makers in care settings to co-develop and co-evaluate WhatMatters in long-term care and hospital settings. WhatMatters will be an easy-to-use app that offers a personalized list of resources (music, videos, and photographs) to enable staff to deliver person-centered care. Family members can upload or live stream music, photos, and videos to support care for people with dementia in a care setting. Mixed-methods, including observation, focus groups, and interviews, will be used to evaluate WhatMatters, such as what works well and what strategies are needed to overcome barriers. WhatMatters will support continuity of care when the person with dementia needs to move between care locations such as hospitals and care homes. We expect WhatMatters will have benefits for 1. People with dementia (improvement in the quality of life with a decrease in isolation), 2. Staff (increase in job satisfaction with easy-to-use resources for care practice), and 3. Healthcare system (an improvement of workforce capacity with a more person-centered care culture).","Leanne Currie, Habib Chaudhury, Lillian M Hung, Caylee Raber, Alison Phinney, Jennifer Boger, Angelica Lim","University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, University of British Columbia, Emily Carr University of Art + Design, University of British Columbia, University of Waterloo, Simon Fraser University"
1,5th Annual Toronto Area Memory Group (TAMeG) Conference ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215195,"The greater Toronto and Southern Ontario regions contain world-leading centres for memory research. There is a younger generation of prolific memory researchers active in cognitive neuroscience and psychology distributed throughout academic and medical centres across the region, yet there is no formal mechanism for these researchers to interact, share findings, and foster collaborations. The annual TAMeG conference leverages the geographical proximity to optimize inter-institutional communication and collaboration among these young researchers. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows are invited to give oral presentations of their work allowing for the dissemination of research. Past conferences have had up to 200 attendees from across the province and approximately 30 trainee presentations involving topics related to cognitive neuroscience and psychology of memory, such as cognition in healthy adults, brain imaging, memory disorders and basic animal research. These presentations reflect the latest research conducted in neuroscience and psychology labs across Ontario with the intention to improve understanding of memory and the brain. This meeting provides a unique forum for both basic and applied researchers to interact. Over the past 5 years, the reputation of this meeting has grown to the point where it is regarded as similar in quality to international meetings, as evidenced by the eventual publication of TAMeG presentations in leading journals. Each year the TAMeG meeting features an interactive presentation regarding issues of interest in academics and science. Our keynote lecturer for 2019 is, Dr. Paula Croxson, Senior Manager for Education Programs at Columbia University's Zuckerman Institute who is a specialist in scientific communication as well as a neuroscientist. Dr. Croxson will be joined by Toronto PR and media specialists from Science Everywhere in an interactive discussion to promote knowledge and methods in communicating with the public.",Brian T Levine,Baycrest Health Sciences
2,A Critical Comparative Analysis of Integrated Care Systems and Policies for Older Adults in BC and Beyond ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/148238,"Canada is currently undergoing a period of rapid population aging, and by 2036 it is estimated that approximately 1/4 of Canadians will be seniors. Seniors, particularly those of advanced older ages (75+), are at an increased likelihood of experiencing declines in health, multiple chronic conditions, and disability. As a result, they often require long-term care from multiple services and providers in both the health and social care sectors. Currently our health care system is not well designed to provide care to patients with long-term care needs. Fragmentation within the health care system makes it very difficult for patients requiring long-term, complex, or chronic disease care to navigate the health care system and receive the care they need. Integrated care systems have been proposed as a way to make the Canadian health care system more efficient and to meet the needs of our aging population. Integrated care systems seek to connect the different parts of the health care system and the social care system in order to create more efficient systems of care and better experiences of care for patients. In particular, it is important that we have an integrated home and community care system (home and community care includes services such as home care, home support, case management, residential care, etc.) for seniors, as these services are frequently required by seniors with long-term care needs. The purpose of my research is to examine the current state of the home and community care system in B.C. and proposed reforms to this system, and contrast this with other regions (e.g., Denmark, Australia, other Canadian provinces) which have more integrated home and community care systems. This research will help to identify successful models of integrated care systems and lessons for reforms in B.C.",Laura T Kadowaki,Simon Fraser University
3,A collaborative evaluation of the Iiyuu Ahtaawin Miyupimaatisiiun Planning (IAMP) Initiative for Cree Health ( 2015/16-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/152247,"The goal for this project is to evaluate a major ongoing community-based health planning initiative – the IIyuu Ahtaawin Miyupimaatisiiun Planning (IAMP) – led by the Cree Board of Health and Social Services of James Bay (CBHSSJB). IAMP involves the entire Cree territory in Northern Quebec. Our evaluative focus is to determine IAMP’s implications and impact in terms of structures (e.g., committees, staff, services), decision-making processes (e.g., setting health priorities), and early outcomes at the community and regional level. Further, we will assess the potential sustainability and transferability for this planning approach to other remote indigenous contexts.This CBHSSJB-McGill Research team grew through a CIHR Planning Grant (2013-2014) that enabled our team to conduct a Rapid Evidence Review on health planning in indigenous communities and to begin reviewing planning processes at the CBHSSJB. The McGill team members have extensive experience working with indigenous communities in health, education, natural resources, and priority setting. The CBHSSJB team members are comprised of senior administrators involved in planning, management, and implementation.We will approach this research using a Community-Based Participatory Research (CBPR) framework in combination with Patton’s developmental evaluation framework (2010). We will focus our evaluation on four of the nine communities (the two highest and two lowest performing in terms of health planning progress). Data collection methods will include: 1. Interviews and focus groups (pre-and post-health plan implementation); 2. Document review (e.g., community health profiles, community health plans); 3. Social media survey. Analysis will focus on three levels: 1. Four Cree communities; 2. IAMP project team located in the CBHSSJB; 3. Regional entities in the Cree James Bay area. Locally, our data will be used to look at concrete changes made in the four communities and the degree of community engagement in these planning processes. This will include both in-case analysis (the case being the community) and across-case analysis, looking at the similarities and difference across the four contexts. At the level of the CBHSSJB, an analysis is needed to address the working of the IAMP project team, the challenges and successes of the structure and the processes, as well as the knowledge and learning from this experience. In the regional analysis, we will consider the use of these results beyond this project and for longer-term evaluation, as well as the transferability and scalability of IAMP for other remote indigenous communities in Canada.Knowledge Translation will follow community, regional, national, and academic tracks. Locally, we will share our findings with the four communities as well as with the communities not directly involved in the analysis. Podcasts, radio broadcasts and town hall meetings are commonly used in these communities as KT activities. Further, we will create short video clips summarizing key findings and lessons learned. Regionally, the CBHSSJB will uses these findings as they move forward with the IAMP initiative beyond the current funding cycle into 5 and 10 year evaluation goals. We will also prepare a report for Health Canada as they have expressed interest in the future directions of IAMP. Finally, we will also share our findings in traditional academic conferences and journals.",Mary E Macdonald,McGill University
4,A comprehensive account of price discrimination: new evidence from the airline industry ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113373,"This proposal provides a new perspective on a central topic in the field of Economics: price discrimination. This refers to the practice by which firms charge consumers different prices for very similar, or even identical, goods. This is a common, and extremely lucrative, practice for firms. It also raises key questions about equity and fairness for consumers and policymakers. Price discrimination is widespread, and affects consumers in many, complex ways. It may take benign forms, such as discounts for students at movie theatres, or various talk and text bundles offered by cellphone companies. In other cases, it may lead to resentment or even anger among consumers, and deep concerns among policymakers. One example is personalized pricing, reportedly practiced by Amazon, whereby different consumers can pay different prices for identical items. Another is overbooking by airlines, which led to the recent incident of a traveller being dragged off a United Airlines flight; this overbooking situation was created because airlines choose not to allow resale markets for their tickets, as they are aware that secondary markets would undermine their ability to practice price discrimination. Within the field of Economics, price discrimination is generally classified into two types. Second-degree price discrimination, also called menu pricing, refers to firms offering a menu of options, with differing prices, allowing consumers to self-select into their preferred option; for example, a menu of plans offered by cellphone companies. Third-degree price discrimination, also called group pricing, refers to firms explicitly charging different prices for nearly identical goods, based on characteristics of consumers; for example, discounts for students or seniors. (There is also a type called first-degree price discrimination, but it is rarely encountered in practice.) Research into price discrimination is extensive. However, both theoretical and empirical lines of inquiry have tended to focus on one or the other of the two types in isolation, ignoring the possibility that firms may practice both kinds simultaneously. This may be because theoretical models that incorporate both types become very complex, while empirical analyses are often hampered by the lack of data, especially because firms are wary of revealing their price discrimination practices. Yet, many firms do actually implement both kinds simultaneously, and this phenomenon is growing, as firms increasingly acquire large sets of information about their consumers through behavioural targeting and their knowledge of consumers' electronic purchasing habits --- a phenomenon often referred to as 'Big Data'. In the proposed research, I will conduct a comprehensive study of both second- and third-degree price discrimination. Specifically, I will examine the airline industry, which engages in both types using increasingly sophisticated techniques. I will use new data, obtained after careful negotiations with a private airline; this will be the first time that a scholar in Economics has obtained such data. I will explore these data to examine price discrimination based on advance purchases as well as quality levels. I will investigate how each type of discriminatory pricing interacts with the other, and how each is affected by the degree of competition faced by the firm. The findings will make important theoretical and empirical contributions, and will significantly advance our understanding of a common, and growing, practice. I expect that the results will be of interest to academics, policymakers, consumers, and the business community.",Ambarish Chandra,University of Toronto
5,"A longitudinal examination of the associations among recent stressful life events, emotional reactivity, and nonsuicidal self-injury among university students ( 2017/18-2019/20 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113302,"Nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) is a widespread problem behaviour among emerging adults (ages 18 - 25 years) on university campuses in Canada. As many as 1 out of 5 university students has engaged in NSSI, which refers to the direct and deliberate destruction or alteration of bodily tissue in the absence of lethal intent (e.g., self-cutting, burning). Relative to those who do not attend university, emerging adults who attend university are two times more likely to engage in NSSI, suggesting that aspects of the university experience may heighten risk for NSSI. Engagement in NSSI is associated with increased risk for other problem behaviours (e.g., alcohol and substance use), and students who engage in NSSI are at increased risk for suicidal behaviour in their later adult years. Despite the widespread prevalence of NSSI among university students, little is known about the processes through which NSSI develops, or its contributing and mitigating factors, during the university years. Recent theory suggests that NSSI may be a coping behaviour that is initiated in response to heightened negative affect (i.e., emotional reactivity) following recent stressful or challenging situations (e.g., stressful life events). Additionally, it has been suggested that risk for NSSI in the context of a stressful life event may be greater among individuals with NSSI specific factors (or factors that increase the likelihood that an individual will choose NSSI over another coping behaviour when emotionally distressed), such as having friends who engage in NSSI. Although mounting evidence supports the contention that NSSI is a form of emotion coping behaviour, comprehensive and theoretically-driven examinations of the process through which recent stressful life events may lead to increased risk for NSSI (e.g., through emotional reactivity), or for whom this process may be most pronounced, are sorely lacking. Elucidating pathways to NSSI, and identifying those students most at risk, is necessary to develop evidence-informed early prevention and intervention approaches for NSSI and support student well-being on university campuses in Canada. To clarify pathways to NSSI among university students, our three central research objectives are to examine: 1) if recent stressful life events predict NSSI engagement over time, and whether this association is indirect through emotional reactivity; 2) if the link between recent stressful life events and NSSI through emotional reactivity varies depending on the type of stressful life event (e.g., academic, interpersonal), and 3) if the association between stressful life events and NSSI through emotional reactivity is stronger among students with NSSI specific risk factors (e.g., having peers who self-injure). To meet these objectives, 1000 first-year university students will complete an online survey three times during their first year (i.e., baseline, four-month follow-up, eight-month follow-up), reporting on recent stressful life events, emotional reactivity, NSSI specific risk factors, and NSSI behaviour. Structural equation modelling in Mplus will be used to analyze the data. Dr. Chloe Hamza (PI) is a leading researcher in NSSI among emerging adults with expertise in longitudinal research methods, and Dr. Abby Goldstein (Co-App) is a Canada Research Chair (Tier II) in the Psychology of Emerging Adulthood. Dr. Nancy Heath (Co-App) is a senior scholar who has been internationally recognized for her work on NSSI in educational settings (e.g., schools, colleges, universities). The team's combined expertise makes them uniquely qualified to carry out the proposed project, including student mentorship and training, as well as widespread knowledge mobilization to relevant national and international stakeholders.","Chloe A Hamza, Nancy Lee Heath, Abby L Goldstein","University of Toronto, McGill University, University of Toronto"
7,"Addressing sexual- and drug-related HIV risk among young gay, bisexual and other MSM ( 2017/18-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147279,"In BC and many other contexts, there are increasing concerns that HIV and other sexually transmitted and blood-borne infections (STBBIs) diagnoses (e.g., chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) are accumulating among young gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM) at higher rates than previous generations. Epidemiological evidence links high-risk sexual behaviour with substance use, including the use of stimulants (e.g., crystal methamphetamine) and sedatives (e.g., GHB). While the need for innovative interventions to address sexual- and drug-related HIV risk among young gbMSM is high, the information available to inform more effective interventions in this area remains limited. Over the next five years, our team will develop new harmonized data systems, launch new training and mentoring opportunities, build multi-sectoral capacity and identify actionable strategies to inform the scale up of two key interventions in this area: (a) Mpowerment, a community-initiated intervention that aims to enhance the health and well-being of young gbMSM; and (b) Health Initiative for Men (HIM), a non-governmental organization that provides gbMSM-centered sexual health services at five community clinics across Metro Vancouver and the Fraser Valley. Our team reflects a novel multi-disciplinary mix of new and senior investigators, trainees, youth co-researchers and key knowledge users. Our team's level of interaction and integration will be high, and we have designed our research approach, governance structure and scale up activities to facilitate this approach to collaboration. The results of the conceptually linked research activities will build capacity in relation to intervening through a multi-faceted, 'systems-level' approach and, in so doing, will also be making innovative methodological, empirical and ethical contributions to the scholarship and application of HIV implementation science.","Rodney E Knight, Jean A Shoveller, Jade Boyd, Kate Shannon, John L Oliffe, Danya Fast, Andrea B Krüsi, Thomas H Kerr, Nadia S Fairbairn, Ryan Mcneil, Nathan J Lachowsky, Devon Greyson, Olivier Ferlatte, Olivier Ferlatte, Kora A Debeck, Travis Salway, Devon Greyson, Kora A DeBeck","University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of Victoria, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of Montreal, Simon Fraser University, Simon Fraser University, University of Massachusetts, Simon Fraser University"
8,Advancing Concussion Assessment and Treatment in Children and Youth ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147640,"Each year, millions of children sustain concussions/mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI), and 15-25% suffer persistent symptoms and declines in quality of life. Clinicians caring for these children face three critical, unanswered questions: how to diagnose concussion, how to predict which children will suffer persistent symptoms, and how to treat those who do? My overall goal is to answer these questions through an interdisciplinary program that combines systematic research, embedded knowledge translation (KT), and training/mentoring (Figure 1). My long-term vision is to transform clinical care and improve outcomes for children with concussion.My research plan has two core aims (Figure 2). Aim 1 will improve diagnosis and prognosis of mTBI by focusing on assessment. The objective is to conduct a prospective, longitudinal, multi-site cohort study that assesses novel neurobiological and psychosocial markers (e.g., genes; psychological hardiness) hypothesized to (1) identify mTBI and (2) predict outcomes of mTBI. The findings will enable better detection of mTBI in children, especially those at risk for poor outcomes, and help identify modifiable risk factors. These factors are targeted by Aim 2, which will improve the treatment of persistent symptoms. The objective is to design and test neurocognitive and psychosocial interventions hypothesized to reduce children’s post-concussive symptoms. The interventions will be tested in randomized controlled trials (RCTs), first individually and subsequently in multi-arm RCTs involving promising biomedical treatments (e.g., melatonin, cervico-vestibular therapy).The research program responds directly to the concerns of patients, families, clinicians, institutional decision makers (e.g., Alberta Health Services), and other knowledge users. It builds on these partnerships via an integrated KT plan, which includes an advisory committee to provide ongoing stakeholder participation, patient engagement researchers to generate research by and for patients, and a dedicated knowledge broker to weave a broad translational network and build a strategy for the dissemination and uptake of study findings by scientists and end users.The program will build research capacity via interdisciplinary training and mentoring along a “multi-generational” chain. My students and trainees, as well as those supervised by other research team members, will be immersed in the research program and engage in program-specific training activities (e.g., mentoring committees, lab rotations, annual conference) while capitalizing on institutional educational opportunities. In addition, senior investigators on the team will mentor junior members and support them in developing independent research.I have directed seminal research on mTBI and shaped its clinical care (CV Journal Articles #2,8,11,12,17,18,19,20,21,23; Book #1). The University of Calgary sought me out to lead a campus-wide, integrated concussion research program that is a key element of its strategic plan. I have assembled a multidisciplinary, Canada-wide team of researchers, many of whom I work with on existing CIHR team grants, with expertise in outcomes assessment, neuroimaging, genetics, clinical trials, psychosocial treatment, biostatistics, animal modeling, and KT science. My expertise and leadership, together with an exceptional team and the unique resources found at the University of Calgary, position my program to be a world leader in paediatric concussion.",Keith O Yeates,University of Calgary
9,Aerodynamic Improvement of Centrifugal Compressors ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/23141,"A step improvement in aero-engine technology will be crucial for the air transport industry to confront the inevitable increase in fuel prices, competition and environmental pressures. The centrifugal compressor, which has far superior pressure ratio per stage than axial compressors currently used in most aircraft engines, can play a major role in this improvement. Indeed, the replacement of many axial compressor stages by a single centrifugal compressor stage will result in simpler, shorter and lighter aero-engines. However, the aerodynamic performance and technology of centrifugal compressors must be brought close to that of axial compressors. The proposed research will build on experience and developments in axial compressor technology to significantly improve the aerodynamics of centrifugal compressors for wider use in aero-propulsion. It will seek to improve the adiabatic efficiency and stall margin of centrifugal compressors as well as reduce the degradation of these parameters with engine age. It is proposed to do so through investigation and understanding of the flow physics and developing effective design and flow control strategies by using a pioneering cost-effective approach that takes advantage of the rapid evolution in additive manufacturing (3D printing) technology. First, additive manufacturing technology allows for the exploration highly complex designs that were not practical or possible with standard manufacturing technology. In addition, polymer 3D printing technology allows forfastfabricationof relatively inexpensive test rigs. The proposed research will rely on low-cost fully instrumented rotating centrifugal compressor rigs custom designed and built with3D printingby large teams of senior undergraduate students in a two-semester final-year design project course that has successfully produced compressor rigs for three years. The test data obtained from the first new rig will serve to validate a computation fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation tool to capture the complex flow field in centrifugal compressors. This simulation tool will be used, along with analytical modelling, by graduate students to elucidate/understand the flow mechanisms associated with the three aspects studied and predict the effect of aerodynamic improvement strategies. The second new rig will then serve to experimentally validate these strategies. In doing so, this research will provide cost-effective training of a large number of HQP in all three aspects of engineering (analytical/numerical/experimental) and provide industry with sought-after experts in centrifugal compressor technology not only for aeronautics but also for the very wide variety of industries that use this technology.",HuuDuc Vo,Polytechnique Montréal
10,Aerospace composites mechanical damage prediction through multi-scale modelling ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/13326,"The replacement of metallic aerospace parts by the introduction of composites in the 1960's offered the promises of lighter aircraft. Lighter aircraft consume less fuel, which provides a competitive advantage to aircraft manufacturers, and reduce polluting emanations, which is essential to ensure Earth's sustainability. Yet, weight savings in Canadian aircraft range from 0 to 5% , whereas senior aerospace composites experts believe that it could safely be around 15%, and beyond with new composites .Prohibitively expensive certification costs and over-conservative safety factors contribute to this poor performance. This situation must absolutely be remedied to maintain Canada's competitiveness in aerospace. Accurate composites predictive damage models could significantly decrease the weight of composite parts, since: i ) some certification tests could be replaced by predictions, which would accelerate the introduction newer materials of improved performance and ii ) accurate models will lead to lower safety factors, and hence, to lighter aircraft. The World Wide Failure Exercise on composites revealed that current models cannot predict composite failure within reasonable accuracy for every load case. Composites damage is a complex process initiated by sub-micron cracks that propagate through the hierarchy of scales. C lassical continuum mechanic is ill-suited for handling these discontinuities. The proposed research program aims at developing a multi-scale framework for predicting composites failure by simultaneously investigating: i ) experimental methods for identifying relevant material parameters, ii ) models for predicting composites damage initiation and propagation and iii ) numerical strategies for delivering efficient composites damage predictions. The program relies on Peridynamics , which is a relatively new formulation for continuum mechanics that eludes most of the classical approaches' shortcomings. The research will be carried out by 4 PhD students and 1 post-doctoral fellow, supported by 13 undergraduate students and 1 research associate. Most graduate students will be co-supervised by professors of complementary expertise (experimental, theoretical and numerical). Every PhD student will perform a short-time (2-3 weeks) internship with well-known international experts, as well as a four-month internship in an aerospace company as part of a larger training program aiming at improving the aerospace industry readinyness level of graduate students. This program should trigger the essential paradigm shift for properly addressing composites damage prediction, and hence reap the full weight reduction potential composites offer. The methodology is tailored for the aerospace industry to accelerate its transfer with the next generation of experts that will be specifically trained for that objective throughout the program.",Martin Lévesque,Polytechnique Montréal
12,Alone in a Crowd: Social isolation among urban-dwelling older women ( 2017/18-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/146705,"Social isolation is a growing problem for many older people in Canada. When someone becomes socially isolated, they do not get enough good quality social contact with other people. Older people who are socially isolated can experience many harmful side-effects, including both physical and mental health complications, as well as premature death. Research on social isolation has begun to explore social isolation among older people, although little research has considered the unique experiences of older women who live in cities and urban areas with respect to social isolation. This project will fill this gap in research and focus on social isolation among older women in urban areas, and how social isolation affects their well-being. This project has three phases designed to answer these research questions and share findings with the public. Phase One will use data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging to gain a better understanding of social isolation in relation to other social factors. Phase Two will consist of flexible interviews and focus groups with older women who live in an urban area who are at-risk of social isolation. Additionally, a group of 6-8 older women will participate in the research process and help create the interview questionnaires that will be used. Phase Three will consist of a social media campaign to increase public knowledge of social isolation and its harmful side-effects based on the findings from Phases One and Two. This campaign will also be designed alongside the group of 6-8 older women from Phase Two. The entire study will focus on the voices and experiences of women who are at-risk of social isolation. Results from this study will be used to influence policy and programs to support the needs of socially isolated older women at the local, provincial, and federal levels, and aim to reduce experiences with social isolation in Canada.",Rachel Weldrick,McMaster University
16,B/OLD: Aging in our city ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184120,"Age-friendly cities, smart cities, sustainable cities: how we live together in urban spaces is on the public and intellectual agenda around the world. Yet who are the imagined citizens implied within these discourses? ""B/OLD: Aging in our city"", is a free, two-day public symposium, accompanied by a two-week exhibition, that probes the specificities of aging in Montreal from a multidisciplinary, multisectoral, intergenerational action research perspective. Taking place at Concordia University, B/OLD opens the University's doors to community activists, students, politicians, policy makers, the media and, most importantly, older adults themselves, inviting all participants to ""be bold"" and to embrace ""old"". In a time where increasing numbers of cities within Quebec are being certified as 'age-friendly', inclusion and belonging among older adults continues to be elusive. B/OLD is a deliberate response to these contradictions. This symposium and exhibition in Concordia's 4th Space (living lab) brings together diverse audiences to challenge the idea of the University as an age-segregated space, and invites older people to come to the University to engage with local research and their community. The overall goal of B/OLD is to enable a set of generative meetings between constituents concerned with the future of our city and to generate intergenerational and intersectoral exchanges on what it means to age in the city. We aim to provide a more robust image, and set of actual practices, for aging in the city that challenges ageist assumptions on aging and unlearn what we have been taught about ""being old"". B/OLD challenges the narrative of decline and also acknowledges the realities of aging as they are embedded in our municipal infrastructures. These infrastructures create positions of precarity for older citizens. For this reason, and as a response to age-friendly initiatives, B/OLD is dedicated to rectifying the exclusion of the most precariously positioned older people from the age- friendly city agenda. Participants will engage B/OLDly around the issue of aging in our city. Creating conditions of accessibility and inclusion, exchanges between Montrealers 'who are older' (i.e., over 65) and those 'who will be old' will explore topics of radical housing movements, climate change and aging, the participation of older adults in politics and activist movements, maker culture and technology design, as well as innovations on aging and the creative arts. We proudly engage with Indigenous and settler artists to explore creativity as we age. The B/OLD exhibition, which will launch during the symposium, and take place in Concordia's 4th Space, includes artwork and technological innovations, such as senior-focused podcasts and digital stories that have resulted from activities that precede the symposium and will document collaborations that occur during the symposium. B/OLD's workshops include intergenerational graffiti workshops, maker workshops, forum theatre, pop-up art hives, and an Escape Room that prompts participants to consider some of the conundrums of aging that are connected to discriminatory built environments, policies, practices, and media discourse. Outcomes include: 1) A web and print (for accessibility to seniors) publication of abstracts for the symposium. 2) Documentation of the workshops, exhibition and symposium including audio or video interviews with artists, practitioners, researchers. 3) A public exhibition & performances in the 4th Space. 4) A special issue of Age, Culture and Humanities featuring full papers, research notes, images or multimedia work with accompanying artist statement, drawn from symposium and workshop participants. 5) A formal evaluation to design 'promising practices' for future collaborations.","Shannon Hebblethwaite, Laurel Young","Concordia University, Concordia University"
17,"Being Gendered: On Women, Feminism, and Philosophy ( 2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183448,"Feminism and philosophy have had a charged history. Feminists have challenged the philosophical tradition and its contemporary proponents for their exclusion of women and their lack of attention to gender inequality. Similarly, philosophers have sometimes looked disdainfully on feminism, according it a second-class status in relation to other philosophical pursuits. My project, however, aims to model a mutually productive relationship, following others who have used their training in philosophy to embolden their feminist analyses and their training in feminism to illuminate philosophical insights. It will identify ongoing issues of sexist oppression, use these issues to help illuminate some of the most significant ideas of the tradition, and in turn show how these ideas are powerful resources for the critical feminist approach to sexist oppression. The project will pursue this commitment in interaction with students, the public, and academic audiences. It will result in the production of several academic and non-academic talks, several journal articles, and a book. It will support one Ph.D. student with a stipend, hiring that same student or another doctoral student to do some occasional research as well, and it will employ two M.A. and three undergraduate students as research assistants. Since it addresses issues relevant to contemporary public discourse, it will engage the efforts of these students to hold public workshops in multiple venues--schools, a local women's group, and seniors' homes--so as to engage the public around issues of gender and sexism and the question of how our societies might best support interaction with people, cultures, and practices that are unfamiliar. Using a phenomenological method that begins with a description of immediate experience and explores its conditions of possibility, the project will engage theoretically with the issues requiring ongoing feminist attention: appearance and sexual interaction; gendered expectations of behaviour; nature and reproduction; law, politics, and the economy; and the domains in which we experience open-endedness: interaction with non-familiar others and creative and intellectual activity. I will rely for treatment of these feminist themes on key feminist interlocutors (such as de Beauvoir, Fraser, Butler, Lugones, and Narayan). While these feminists have been broadly informed by the same philosophical insights as I, I wish to make these lines of connection clearer, identifying the basic ideas from the philosophical tradition that best support feminist labour: for instance, the theme of ""recognition"" illuminated best by Hegel, which concerns how we are constituted as human in interaction with other people; our erotic openness to others, thematized by Plato and Merleau-Ponty; the relation between freedom and habit explicated effectively by Merleau-Ponty and Heidegger; the tendency described by Marx and Sartre of economic imperatives to overtake other kinds of imperatives; the rich discussions of the relation between human specificity and openness that can be found in Plato, Hegel, and Derrida. The project will be of interest to students of philosophy, insofar as it interprets the philosophical ideas most pivotal for understanding human experience. It will be of import to the local public, insofar as the students and I will conduct workshops and give talks relevant to issues in public discourse. It will be of use to people interested in feminism, insofar as it addresses the fundamental issues of sexist oppression.

18,Burden sharing in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO): a post-positivist analysis ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110306,"The literature on NATO burden sharing (BS) clearly lacks a post-positivist perspective (Zyla, 2015), which is able to produce much richer and deeper causal explanations and understandings of state motivations for (or against) sharing NATO burdens than simply treating burden sharing as an outcome (=the current practice in the literature). Indeed, current studies, especially those in the field of political economy (see lit. review for details), are only able to show some statistical trends; they are unable to go deeper in the analysis and explain why a particular trend exists (e.g. free-riding) and why it occurred at a particular point in time. Moreover, as I have shown elsewhere (Zyla, 2013, 2015), the literature is predominantly informed by a rationalist methodology that is informed by deductive and hypothesis testing research designs that are, to a large extent, informed by methodological individualism. Consequently, researchers are only able to make inferences from the data; they are unable to seek deeper and richer explanations as to why states share collective burdens in the first place and in what particular social and material contexts. In short, what the literature on NATO burden sharing clearly lacks is a bottom-up (inductive) approach that offers much richer and deeper causal explanations and understandings of state motivations for (or against) sharing NATO burdens. I have developed the need for such a research program in my earlier BS writings (Zyla, 2015, 2016a, 2016b). The aim of this project is to fill this lacuna---that is develop such an inductive program based on a post-positivist (or non-materialistic/social) ontology---and conduct empirical tests among 5 case studies. This allows us to understand the intersubjective social structures of agents and their value rational motivations for sharing NATO burdens, because it is not merely cost-benefit analyses that determine states' motivations but also societal norms, values, as well as belief and power structures. At this point, for instance, we are unable to understand the influence of social representation and power structures on BS or political elites' (senior bureaucrats, politicians) interpretations of 'burden', 'fairness', and 'justice', also vis-à-vis others. In short, this project employs a non-materialistic (or social) ontology on NATO BS that allows us to understand how in a post-9/11 order states (1) define NATO's public goods in their polities---that is how collective burdens are constructed, and why; (2) what meaning they assign to it and in what particular institutional context (Geertz, 1973: 5); (3) what value-rational (rather than instrumentally rational) motivation drives states' burden sharing behavior (e.g. traditions, trust, reciprocity, responsibility) (Zyla, 2013, 2015, 2016a) and their normative predispositions towards NATO public goods more generally; and (4) how national burden sharing values are (perhaps) negotiated and traded in NATO's political marketplace of ideas and meanings. Epistemologically, the project follows Max Weber's explanatory understanding, which is helpful to trace the factors that assigned specific meanings to NATO's new public good(s) without risking to exclude either the explanatory or understanding side. It thus dissolves the dualism between erklären (explaining) and verstehen (understanding), and includes subjective norms and values (value rationality) in the analysis without abandoning the notion of causal explanations and individual actions. The project is anchored theoretically in the constructivist strand of foreign policy analysis theory, and uses a comparative, qualitative research design with the following methods: case studies, semi-structured expert interviews, and discourse analysis.",Benjamin Zyla,University of Ottawa
19,CIHR/Schlegel Industrial Research Chair for Colleges in Seniors' Care ( 2017/18-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/153362,"Demographic changes, growing consumer needs and expectations for increased quality and cost-effectiveness of healthcare services underpin the urgent need for innovation in post-secondary education, research and care for seniors. The CIHR/Schlegel Industrial Research Chair for Colleges at Conestoga College has successfully engaged in this innovation challenge at a provincial level since 2012. We are now proposing to expand this work to a national level by developing innovative strategies to prepare the Canadian workforce for seniors care. We will achieve this by collaborating with colleges, researchers, healthcare professionals, seniors and their families, as well as industry and community partners to develop innovative education, improve workforce development, and strengthen care practices to support seniors and their families. This work is unique in Canada, as we intentionally and strategically integrate education, research, and practice in seniors care through partnerships between Conestoga College and the Schlegel-University of Waterloo Research Institute for Aging, Schlegel Villages - a continuum of care for long-term care residents and seniors, SCA AMERICAS - a manufacturer of care products, and Point-Click Care, an electronic health records system provider. This program will have fundamental implications for employers and employees in seniors care in Canada and provide excellence in education and workforce development supporting care for seniors in Canada. As Chair, Dr. Boscart has realized exemplary clinical and research accomplishments, and achieved national recognition. Dr. Boscart will expand the engagement of college and industry partners as well as community and government organizations at a national level to achieve three aims: 1) to create innovation in education to build a competent workforce in seniors care; 2) to implement applied research to enhance care quality to lead optimization of care models; and 3) to develop connections and knowledge mobilization strategies for educators, researchers and professionals. The key outcomes of our work will lead to advances in education, research and practice at a national level and will provide the motivation and input for alignment between workforce needs and seniors",Barbara Fennessy,Conestoga College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning
21,"COVID-19 Physical Distancing and Post-Traumatic Stress Injury: Utilization of Digital Health and Remote Mental Health Services for Military, Veterans, and Public Safety Personnel ( 2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231788,"Physical distancing arising from COVID-19 has rapidly forced a paradigm shift toward remote mental health (MH) service delivery and a surge in the use of digital health (DH) (e.g., teletherapy/medicine, eHealth, and mHealth). Though limited in use mere weeks ago, DH has become essential for system access, assessment, and treatment. Legal, clinical, cultural, practical, and security considerations, however, remain unaddressed for delivering MH services to trauma-affected populations (TAPs). TAPs include public safety personnel (PSP; e.g., border services, communications officials, correctional workers, firefighters, paramedics, police, etc.), military members, and Veterans struggling with Post-Traumatic Stress Injuries (PTSIs) and other MH concerns that can be associated with or exacerbated by the pandemic. As TAPs may be particularly affected by changes from in-person to digital delivery of MH services, an understanding is needed of: (1) the clinical effectiveness of DH when addressing PTSIs; (2) perspectives of persons with lived experience, MH clinicians, senior leadership and policymakers; (3) the current context, needs, and considerations associated with DH uptake and use; and (4) realistic solutions for effectively delivering DH to TAPs. The HiMARC research team, with its established relationships with PSP, military, and Veteran communities in Alberta and beyond, is well-positioned to conduct a current state and needs analysis through a rapid review and key stakeholder engagements with the aim of synthesizing knowledge of needs, gaps, barriers, and facilitators for DH delivery of PTSI assessment and interventions. A co-designed, multi-phased knowledge mobilization and implementation plan coordinated with national efforts (e.g., CIPSRT and CIMVHR) will be created to deliver safe digital MH services at local, national, and international levels to PSP, military, Veteran, and civilian populations suffering from MH conditions including PTSIs.","Suzette C Bremault-Phillips, Martin W Ferguson-Pell, Andrew J Greenshaw, Vincent O Agyapong, Russ Greiner, Xin-Min Li, Kristopher Wells, Matthew R Brown, Olga Winkler, .

This study will be conducted in Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, the hardest hit provinces in Canada. CANCOV is built on the GEMINI (GEneral Internal Medicine INpatient Initiative) and RECOVER (REhabilitation and reCOVERy after critical illness) established research platforms. Through the CANCOV program of research, we will: 1) characterize the myriad health consequences of COVID-19 including their short and long-term outcomes (recruited from the community and hospitals) and those of their family caregivers, 2) determine the clinical risk factors, timing and pace of recovery across the spectrum of COVID-19 disease, 3) provide detailed clinical descriptions for genetic, basic science, translational and multi-omics research inquiry, and 4) facilitate the creation of prediction models and tools using machine learning and artificial intelligence, as well as secondary clinical studies. Our senior and diverse team of investigators, many with extensive research experience during SARS, will shorten the time to translate knowledge into practice through multiple rapid knowledge to action cycles throughout this project.

24,Canadian Collaboration for Patients with Complexity: Innovation to promote optimal and appropriate care for all. ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/216247,"Nearly 10 million Canadians live with multiple chronic conditions like diabetes, heart disease, depression, arthritis or lung disease. These conditions can make daily life challenging, and having several conditions can increase the risk of poor health and low quality of life. Having chronic conditions often means that people need to do a lot of health care work (take specialized medications, attend appointments, do the necessary tests that their doctors need to make decisions about their care, monitor their conditions at home and watch their diet and exercise) and the more work that people need to do, sometimes the worse they feel about their health. The work does not make them feel well; it just reminds them they are sick. When doctors talk to patients to better understand the effects of chronic conditions on the patient, and to identify what matters most to the patient in terms of working toward health- patients do better. These conversations help doctors and patients understand and trust each other and they work together to make a treatment plan that make sense. Patients are more likely to be successful in treatment because they helped decide on the treatment. Unfortunately, these conversations and shared decision-making on treatment plans does not happen as often as they should because these conversations can be complicated and time consuming, and because the science on patients with many chronic conditions is limited. This meeting will bring together patients, family physicians and specialists to create tools and resources that help doctors and patients have these important conversations and promote shared decision-making. These tools will be easy to use and provide the information needed by patients and doctors to make care decisions that are right and customized for each patient.","France Légaré, Noah M Ivers, Hude Quan, Doreen M Rabi, Victor Montori, Sheldon W Tobe, Peter A Senior","Laval University, Women's College Hospital, University of Calgary, University of Calgary, Mayo Clinic, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre, University of Alberta"

Recognizing the growing prevalence of frailty and the dearth of research evidence to address the complex care needs of frail elderly Canadians, in 2012 NCE awarded CFN (Technology Evaluation in the Elderly Network) a funding mandate to improve the care of frail elderly Canadians and their families within the Canadian healthcare system through the development, rigorous evaluation and ethically-guided implementation of evidence-informed care strategies and practices. The burden of frailty in Canada is steadily growing. Today, approximately 25% of seniors over age 65 and 50% past 85 – over one million Canadians – are medically frail. These individuals are at higher risk for poor health outcomes, adverse events and mortality than would be expected based on their age alone. Frail elderly Canadians are over-represented in all sectors of the healthcare system including primary care, community and residential care, acute care and end-of-life care, and frailty is associated with increased healthcare resource consumption. In 10 years, based on population growth it is estimated that well over two million Canadians will be living with frailty and this growing population is both under-recognized and under-serviced, challenging the healthcare system to improve the quality and quantity of care delivered.",John Muscedere,Queen's University
26,Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging ( 2014/15-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/149399,"The Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) is a national study of adult development and aging that includes 50,000 individuals between the ages of 45 and 85 from across Canada to be followed over 20 years. The ultimate aim of the CLSA is to find ways to improve the health of Canadians by better understanding the processes and dimensions of aging. Over the past 5 years, the CLSA research team has planned and implemented the study and recruited more than 38,000 of the 50,000 participants who have completed baseline assessments including telephone interviews, face-to-face interviews, as well as visits to specially designed data collection sites. The data provided by the 20,000 individuals who completed telephone interviews are now ready for release to researchers, who meet the CLSA requirements for access and are approved through a formal evaluation process. All 50,000 individuals will have completed their baseline assessment by the spring of 2015. The first follow up of the CLSA participants is scheduled to begin in the early summer of 2015 taking place 3 years after the baseline assessments. As part of the follow up participants will undergo repeat assessments and will be asked to complete additional components that have been selected based on recommendations from expert researchers to enhance the information collected and expand the science of the study. In this application, we are requesting funds to enable the CLSA team to plan and complete the first follow up and to plan and begin the second follow up. The need for information collected over time to inform decisions and design interventions and policies to improve the health and well-being of today and tomorrows seniors is widely recognized by researchers, and federal, provincial, and territorial governments.

It affects everybody, especially children, seniors and those with other health issues. Sepsis costs the Canadian healthcare system over $1.5 billion every year, and causes more deaths than breast, bowel and lung cancer put together. Survivors may end up with weak muscles and memory problems. They may lose an arm or leg, have to go on dialysis, and still be at risk for more infections. Yet most Canadians have never heard of sepsis. In 2016 the World Health Organization (WHO) declared sepsis to be a world emergency. It asked countries to count their numbers of septic patients, educate the public and healthcare workers on how recognize and treat sepsis, and to develop new treatments. To meet the WHO's strategic plan, Sepsis Canada scientists, patients and families promise to do exactly that. By 2025, our goal is to ensure that every septic patient in Canada is identified and treated. Our slogan is: Suspect sepsis, save lives, support recovery! We will learn which Canadians are at greatest risk of sepsis and the impact on their families. We will create a bank of evidence-based tools to teach the public and health workers and we will study new sepsis treatments. As a result, more Canadians will be alive and well after sepsis, thanks to better and timely access to care.

28,Cancer pharmacoepidemiology: a population-based assessment of the risks of prescription drugs in vulnerable populations ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147722,"Overarching focus of the research programCancer pharmacoepidemiology is emerging as an area of great interest in the medical community. With the increased use of prescription drugs across all ages, the long-term use of prescription drugs in the general population has reached unprecedented levels. While many of these drugs have been shown to have benefits in the short-term, the long-term effects are less certain. Indeed, there are concerns that some drugs may increase the risk of certain cancers. Furthermore, there are concerns that some cancer treatments themselves may be associated with important adverse events.My research program in cancer pharmacoepidemiology is specifically designed to address these concerns. To this end, my program will have three main objectives: 1) to assess whether commonly-prescribed drugs are associated with an increased risk of specific cancers, 2) to assess the safety of cancer treatments, and 3) to develop and apply innovative methods to deal with challenges in conducting cancer pharmacoepidemiologic studies. These objectives will be achieved by conducting large observational studies using comprehensive electronic patient databases and sophisticated pharmacoepidemiologic methods.Impact of the research programWhile trials are considered the gold standard for the assessment of drug efficacy, they are not suitable to assess cancer outcomes as safety endpoints. This is because patients with cancer are often excluded from trials, and cancer is a rare event developing over many years. Thus, the long-term effects of prescription drugs on the incidence of cancer are largely unknown when they enter the market. Similarly, trials of cancer treatments are not designed to assess uncommon yet important adverse events, mainly because of their smaller sample sizes and short durations of follow-up. Thus, there is a need for observational studies in the post-approval setting. With around 2 in 5 Canadians developing cancer in their lifetimes, and 1 in 4 will dying from the disease, it is a public health priority to minimize the risk that may be associated with prescription drugs.My research program will address important public health questions using rigorous pharmacoepidemiologic methodologies and will provide the concerned stakeholders with the necessary information to make informed decisions on the safety of prescription drugs.Core expertiseMy research program in cancer pharmacoepidemiology will include a team of highly-accomplished individuals with whom I have a successful history of collaboration. These individuals have extensive expertise in epidemiology, statistics and methodology, pathophysiology, as well as clinical experience. They include both senior and more junior individuals, and will bring together the necessary skills to successfully carry out this research program.Mentoring and training activitiesWith over 90% of my time protected for research, I am in a unique position to dedicate a good proportion of my time to mentoring and training students. I plan to supervise trainees at all levels, from the master’s to the post-doctoral level. I will also supervise short-term stages of medical residents interested in pharmacoepidemiologic research. Finally, as Program Director of Cancer Pharmacoepidemiology within the McGill Pharmacoepidemiology Research Unit, I am actively involved in organizing and moderating pharmacoepidemiology journal clubs at the Centre for Clinical Epidemiology, Jewish General Hospital.",Laurent Azoulay,McGill University
29,"Canterbury tales project, phase 2 ( 2013/14-2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/106516,"Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, the most important single text in the English language before Shakespeare, presents one of the most difficult of all textual problems in the language. Chaucer left the work unfinished at this death; no autograph manuscript survives; what does survive is a mass of material (84 pre-1500 manuscripts and 4 incunables), for which no scholar has found the key. While most attempts at editing the Tales focus on a few manuscripts, it has been long understood that understanding of the textual history of the Tales must be based on analysis of all the manuscripts and editions before 1500. This was attempted by Manly and Rickert in their massive 1940 edition of the Tales. However, their edition failed to convince later scholars, at least in part because the bulk and complexity of the data defeated their manual methods of analysis. The advent of digital methods in the last decades offered a way past this problem, and from 1992 on the Canterbury Tales Project has sought to explore the history of the pre-1500 textual tradition of Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales using computer-assisted techniques. The first phase of the the Canterbury Tales Project, based in the UK until 2010, established the base model of the project: creation of machine-readable full transcripts of the witnesses; computer-assistend collation of these; development of hypotheses of manuscript relations by computer programs derived from evolutionary biology and other methods. Using these methods, the Project created transcripts of around 40% of the whole text of the Tales in all the manuscripts. About half of these were published in six CD-ROMs and online publications by Cambridge University Press and Scholarly Digital Editions; the remainder is being published by HRI Online at the University of Sheffield. The Phase 2 Project will complete the transcription of all manuscripts of the Tales. In order to do this, the Phase 2 Project will take several new directions. Previously, the Project did all transcripts 'in-house', using graduate students or research staff directly affiliated to the Project. The Phase 2 Project will adapt the community-based model of scholarly transcription pioneered by the University College London 'Transcribe Bentham' project, and now implemented in the Textual Communities project at Saskatchewan. As with the Bentham project, controls will ensure that all transcripts are at least as accurate as those undertaken in the original Project, with the transcripts created by the Phase 2 project collaborators and their students setting the standard for accuracy. Most transcribers will work in a transcription team headed by a senior scholar, who will be responsible, with the PI, for the accuracy of the transcription. However, at least one team will work experimentally without a senior scholar on an open 'Wiki' model: if successful, other teams will follow this model. Phase 2 will also use a new online collation system (CollateX), and new analytic tools developed by evolutionary biologists and others. The Phase 2 Project will also work to a different publication model from the original project (while continuing the project's practice, of publishing analyses as well as materials). All transcripts and all materials developed by the project will be made available free to all, for both commercial and non-commercial use. They will be held in standard digital library systems, to guarantee their availability for generations to come. The project will use semantic web technologies to allow others to construct their own interfaces to the materials, and to combine them with other materials to enable research yet unimagined.",Peter M Robinson,University of Saskatchewan
30,Caring Canines along a Continuum of Continuing Care ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187307,"Caring Canines across a Continuum of Continuing Care Proposal Summary The proposed project is a partnership between Nothwood, a long term continuing care facility interested in developing an innovative care program involving resident dogs, and a researcher whose scholarly and community development areas of expertise are understanding and facilitating the senior human-canine bond. Foundational to the overall project is the perspective that seniors are, and must continue to be, valued as a vital part of our communities and social fabric. The overall goal of the project is to develop one or more models of a resident dog program for future development, implementation, and analysis in diverse sites of the residential care organization. As the population ages and more people have to make relocation decisions, there is an increasing demand for continuing care contexts to acknowledge the role of companion animals in the wellbeing and quality of life of older adults. To date, no other diverse and complex senior care organization has responded to this demand in a systematic and comprehensive way. The proposed project is the first of its kind and stands to serve as a model for other senior care organizations. It also will provide the basis for more in-depth understanding of the role of dogs in the care and well-being of seniors as well as adding to the broader knowledge base on positive ageing. The project will serve as a developmental model for other facilities interested in innovative approaches to positive ageing within a community of care environment. The university-organization partnership and collaboration, offers a broadly informed perspective on canine residency in a seniors residential care facility that will: 1) contribute to the knowledge base on socially innovative person-centred care and the human-animal bond; and 2) inform public policy in this period when planning for an ageing demographic is top of mind. The project design is informed by the broad and long-term goal of creating facilitative contexts for resident wellness and quality of life along a continuum of need. It includes an in-depth study of dog residency, program analysis and consultation, and model development. The project is driven and informed by the needs of Northwood, the partner organization. The primary expected outcome is the development of an evidence-based policy on canine residency in seniors continuing care that is representative of broad stakeholder engagement and conducive to successful implementation across diverse residential contexts. In keeping with the organization's corporate strategic directions, the organization will take a public position on the important issue of dog-senior relationships as part of quality of life and well-being within a care context with an intention to influence related discussion at a public policy level. The project process and outcomes will provide an opportunity to engage front-line staff in a socially innovative project that will help them to understand and act on the importance of senior-canine relationships as a social determinant of well-being and quality of life. For the scholarly community, the research will contribute to knowledge advancement in areas of positive ageing, age-friendly communities, human-animal bond, and the role of dogs in residential care. This innovative project will lead to a long-term and large-scale development, implementation, and analysis of a social innovation in the field of continuing care. The implications of this work are far-reaching across diverse sectors including senior serving organizations, government, education, and community planning, to name a few.",Ardra L Cole,Mount Saint Vincent University
31,Cellular mechanotransduction in the actin cytoskeleton. ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147716,"Program Direction and Overall vision:Mechanics are at the heart of cell biology, and disorders are the basis of many diseasesForce-sensing and mechanical adaptation can be seen in nearly every aspect of our physiology, and cell function appears to be tied to the mechanical state of the cell. We hypothesize that these mechanics are not constant, but are regulated by a cellular control system that measures and responds to forces. When these systems incorrectly transduce or withstand forces, pathological failure may occur. These ideas frame the central question for my program:How do cells sense and respond to force, and how are these mechanisms altered in disease?Expected outcomes and impact:Understanding mechanotransduction will advance basic cell biology, while providing new targets for diagnostics and therapeutics.While this program is focused on basic science, understanding the molecular mechanisms of mechanotransduction will have profound impact across broad fields of study, from cell motility and differentiation to diverse medical disorders including cancers, kidney failure, and cardiovascular disease. Resolving the links between forces and biological systems will be a transformative element of healthcare in this century, both in diagnostics and therapeutics, allowing us to approach pathology from a mechanical perspective, and my research has led to two startup companies that use mechanics to deliver new technologies for improved healthcare. The program described here will continue to innovate new translational metholodogies, as well as reveal basic the science of how forces and mechanics interact with biological systems.Core expertise:Our program lies at the interface of physical engineering and biology, and will draw experts from diverse disciplines to attack these challenges.Understanding the complex biochemical and physical interactions responsible for physiology and pathology is an exceptional challenge across broad disciplines. As a postdoctoral researcher I learned how to draw specialized expertise from applied physics, molecular biology, and medicine to tackle interdisciplinary challenges in modern biophysics. This program will draw expertise from 12 Program Experts who are leaders in their field, across two countries and four institutions, to assemble the best collection of selective excellence. This network of experts will ensure that our program has the diverse support required for success, and will evolve and expand as our program continues. This compendium of support will also safeguard our research by providing redundant facilities any breakdowns or repairs occur, and will ensure that our program has the diverse support required for success. The more senior faculty members will also provide mentorship and guidance as I mature in my faculty growth.Mentoring and training:Guiding today’s research trainees into tomorrow’s research leaders.I continue my strong commitment by currently mentoring six researchers in my research group and growing our team quickly. In brief, my strategy for mentorship will continue to provide an open collaborative environment, where trainees benefit from a diverse and multidisciplinary mixture of researchers in our group, Program, and beyond. Trainees largely design their projects, mentor junior students, present science updates and have personal meetings with me every two weeks, and attend at least one major conference yearly to connect with a broader scientific network.",Allen J Ehrlicher,McGill University
32,Characterizing age-related changes in brain connectivity using sparse graphs. ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/179874,"Canada faces significant aging of its population as the proportion of seniors increases more rapidly than that of all other age groups. By 2026, one Canadian in five will be 65 years or older. Consequently, one of the most paramount social and economic issues facing the Canadian population is the maintenance of intellectual and cognitive integrity in advanced age, factors that are critical to an autonomous standard of living in later years. Our success in identifying, treating, as well as preventing age-related cognitive, structural, and functional changes in the central nervous system greatly depends on our understanding of healthy aging. My project uses high-field MRI in combinations with some of the newest analytical techniques, such as sparse graphs, to illustrate system-level changes in brain organization that occur as a part of a healthy aging process. The current presentation is based on a large cross-sectional cohort (105 individuals, 18-88 years old, and approximately even male/female distribution) of 4.7 T MRI data. Studying neurocognitive aging will help us better characterize changes in the brain throughout the human lifespan and aid us in identifying preclinical markers for cognitive decline. With the population over 65 years of age rising rapidly, discoveries in this domain will likely have a dramatic impact on public health and substantially reduce the burden on families as well as government and social programs.",Stanislau Hrybouski,University of Alberta
33,Co-management of Pacific salmon fisheries: a community-driven approach ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187200,"The proposed research involves a collaboration between the research team (Young, PI) and the organization West Coast Aquatic (WCA). WCA is a not-for-profit, community-led organization that advocates for local involvement in the governance of coastal and aquatic natural resources in the Western Vancouver Island region. Its Board of Directors includes both indigenous and non-indigenous members from a wide range of communities and industrial sectors. WCA has a decades-long track record of fostering deliberative inter-group communication and collaborative local decision-making. The research will involve a neo-institutionalist analysis of WCA's Salmon Roundtables (SR) initiative. The research will inform the expansion of the SR initiative into new species and geographic areas. The SR initiative was launched in 2010 to provide a forum for conflict resolution among diverse participants in salmon fisheries on the West Coast of Vancouver Island, and to represent local interests to the federal Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO) as part of a co-management model of fisheries governance. The SRs provide means for fisheries stakeholders to come together to plan upcoming seasons, make recommendations about harvest levels and fishing plans in-season, and assess outcomes post-season. At present, there are five SRs in operation in the region. Each SR has its own terms of reference written by participants and updated each year, and each SR chooses its own internal procedures, emphases, and scope of topics open for discussion. This procedural flexibility and diversity is seen by WCA and by SR participants as a strength, because it helps the SRs to address the unique dynamics and particular challenges faced in each area. However, this diversity also poses challenges to participants and organizers of the SRs. For instance, it has been challenging for WCA to identify ""best practices"" that may apply across multiple SRs. Similarly, learning across SRs has been difficult due to a lack of directly comparable experiences. These challenges must be addressed quickly, because the WCA is pursuing expansion of the SR initiative to other areas of British Columbia and to other fisheries. Social science research is required into the structures, procedures, and experiences of participants in the existing SRs, to ensure that future decisions about SR scope, design, and function will be informed by in-depth knowledge of what has worked (and what has not) with deliberative decision-making and collaborative governance within the existing SRs. The aim of the proposed research is to provide WCA and the SRs with enhanced capacity to improve and expand the SR program as a model for conflict resolution and for community-driven co-management of natural resources. The research will be informed by neo-institutionalist theory in sociology. Neo-institutionalism sees organizations as embedded in complex institutional environments that include many actors and pressures (government, private, community, interest groups, etc.) that pull organizations in multiple directions. Organizations are shaped by how they respond to these pressures over time, thus making this a powerful theoretical tool for understanding institutional history and diversity. The research will involve in-depth interviews with current and former SR participants (N~35), as well as WCA board members (N~10), other community-level groups (N~25), and representatives of local and senior governments (N~20). All research instruments will be co-designed with community partners. The goal of this research is to produce deliverables to WCA that include: (1) best practices documents to guide the design and implementation of new SRs; (2) guidelines for co-management arrangements and processes between the SRs and DFO.",Nathan J Young,University of Ottawa
34,Commentary on an ancient Greek text: a Canadian collaboration ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107925,"Summary At present, there are a group of senior scholars residing in Canada who are working simultaneously on a project of international standing, the SBL Commentary on the Septuagint (the so-called translation of the Jewish Scriptures into Greek). The theoretical model behind this project was the brainchild of Albert Pietersma of Toronto and his student Cameron Boyd-Taylor, who incorporated into Septuagint studies a translation theory developed by the leading scholars in translation studies, Itamar Even-Zohar and Gideon Toury, who in turn built upon a foundation laid in the 1980's by the functionalist movement, and after them, the early translation studies scholars. It is intended that by means of this grant, the Canadian team of applicants would be the first to complete their project assignments, which will appear as monographs with SBL Press. But equally importantly, the project will spearhead the mentoring and training of younger researchers who will be directly involved in the research itself. Accordingly, funds are being requested over a five-year period in which at least 8 young researchers can be trained as salaried research assistants and eventually as co-authors of papers relating to the research. This training will involve hands-on participation in the following areas: refining the theory, working with papyrus texts, lexicographical and syntactical investigations with the help of online tools, historical and religious inquiries such as sacrifice in the ancient world, and conducting bibliographical searches within secondary literature. It is also planned that the research assistants be given most of the travel funding for attendance and presentation at symposia and after that, to participate in the dissemination of the project's research results by means of co-authoring papers, and the editing and proofreading of conference volumes. The Commentary Series already has a high profile in Canada, since a session dedicated to the Septuagint is now a regular feature of the Canadian Society of Biblical Studies annual conference. From the Victoria Congress (2013) a conference volume dedicated to the Commentary series is now in advanced stages of publication. What makes this commentary project unique over against other projects of its kind, is its attention to the character of the Septuagint as a translation made according to cultural norms existing at the time of its production. In contrast, translated texts that over time achieve the status of free-standing documents, take on different roles determined by the norms of those later cultures. Translation theory has taught us that since translations are tailor-made to the communities for whom they are intended, one can only fully understand a translation's meaning by determining that original community's cultural norms. In the case of the Septuagint, the cultural norm at play at its point of inception, seems to be one in which the original text was held in very high regard, because its language structure (Hebrew) dominates the structure of the translation language (Greek). Therefore the method of commenting on the Septuagint means to make a careful investigation into the close relation that exists between the language items of the source text (the original) and the target text (the translation). This project anticipates outcomes in the non-academic realm. Research activity in translation studies has always found direct applicability in the wider human sphere. A well known case is the preservation of lesser-known or minority languages through deliberate translation strategies based on identifiable cultural norms of target cultures.","Dirk L Buchner, Claude E Cox, Larry J Perkins, Robert .V J Hiebert, Cameron Boyd-Taylor","Trinity Western University, McMaster Divinity College, Trinity Western University, Trinity Western University, Trinity Western University"
35,"Community water fluoridation and oral health: Filling knowledge gaps and strengthening surveillance using opportunities in Alberta, Canada ( 2018/19-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/180039,"Oral health is a very important public health issue. Oral health problems are common. People with oral health problems may have trouble eating, speaking, and interacting with others. Pain and infection from oral disease can cause physical discomfort. Many oral health problems are preventable. One option for prevention is appropriate exposure to fluoride, including via community water fluoridation. Fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public drinking water supply to prevent tooth decay. When it comes to research on fluoridation and oral health, there are some important knowledge gaps. First, much of the evidence is out of date. In a recent systematic review, most of the studies were published before 1975, and there have been important changes since then. Second, almost all research focuses on children, with limited attention to other population groups. In Alberta, we have a unique opportunity to address these limitations. First, we will examine the association between community water fluoridation and children's tooth decay. We will take advantage of the research opportunity provided by Calgary's decision to stop fluoridation in 2011. In previous work, we studied children's dental caries in Calgary 2-3 years after fluoridation was stopped, and compared it to Edmonton where fluoridation continues. We will build on that earlier work by 1) conducting a longer-term follow up (7-8 years after fluoridation was stopped), and 2) conducting an economic analysis, to understand whether or not the benefits of fluoridation are greater than the costs. Second, we will expand our work to consider another population: seniors living in long term care facilities. Seniors in long term care facilities are vulnerable to poor oral health, but they have not been well studied. We have an established research team that includes experienced university researchers and dental public health decision-makers.","Lindsay Mclaren, Melissa L Potestio, Salima Thawer, Salima Thawer, Peter D Faris, Deborah A Mcneil, Cynthia Weijs, Melissa L Potestio, Arianna Waye","University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services, University of Calgary, University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services, Alberta Health Services, University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services, University of Alberta"
36,Context-aware systems for assisting users in their activities of daily living : from activity recognition to augmented reality assistance provision ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/209632,"Smart cities and smart homes, with their sensors and devices, are great technological environments in which context-aware systems can be deployed and where a quantities of information can be collected to support activity recognition and context-aware service provision. Our first objective (Obj.1) is to design strategies and algorithms in order to recognize and predict human activities with hybrid-classification and pattern recognition algorithms as well as Bayesian models. Such algorithms must manage heterogeneity of data, take into account the hardware limits (e.g. battery life), and consider a quasi-real-time analysis of the data on mobile devices. In our recent work, we have developed strategies and algorithms to analyze contextual information to recognize activities of mobile users in urban environment based on hybrid systems. The research activities around the Obj.1 will be to pursue the online activity recognition of mobile users in urban environments by increasing the range of recognized activities and include more contextual information into the recognition process such as surrounding users or temporal logic.******If context-aware applications can provide value-added services to general users, such software can provide extended assistance to dependent users (e.g. seniors), for instance, by helping them in the realization of activities of daily living. Our second objective (Obj. 2) focuses on interdisciplinary work in ubiquitous computing and human-computer interaction, which consists of the conception and development of context-aware services that assist users in the realization of ADLs. More specifically, we are working on two sub-objectives : (a) the design and evaluation of augmented reality cognitive orthoses to support people in the realization of ADLs; (b) design and evaluation of multimodal interactions techniques in AR in order to enhance usability of cognitive orthoses content provided in Obj. 2.a and take into account the limitation of users (e.g. physical or task related limitation). Providing tasks and cognitive assistance in AR includes several challenges from the human factors and technological perspective, such as 3D orientation and interaction, multimodal interactions, attention and mental charge, etc.******The results of my research will contribute significantly to the state of the art of context-awareness, ambient intelligence and user assistance research fields. Our research program will also contribute to the formation of the highly qualified personnel (HQP) involved in our research by providing a high-quality academic education and a dynamic research environment. Finally, we are also working toward having a positive impact on the Canadian population in general by transferring the developed theories, models, and technologies to public and private organizations, but also toward people with special needs by increasing their autonomy and quality of life.",Charles GouinVallerand,Université de Sherbrooke
37,Coordination and Cooperation in Self-Driving Vehicles ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/188426,"Although they are becoming tangible reality, Self-driving vehicles currently face several challenges: They are limited in their speed performance, crash prevention, sensing, cooperation, and coordination capabilities. Their decision making, and hence their actions, rely merely on their on-board sensory and internal control models. To avoid crashes and prevent traffic congestion, self-driving vehicles must anticipate the behaviour of other vehicles in their environment (self-driving and human-operated vehicles), share their internal state with these vehicles, and cooperatively operate to choose joint safe and efficient control policies. A primitive example of self-driving cooperative behaviour can be seen in platooning, where a small group of trucks assemble in a linear structure, using wireless connectivity to maintain a prescribed distance between each other. In this context, the goal of this research program is the development of a framework for coordinating interaction and cooperation among a convoy of self-driving vehicles, operating in complex driving conditions in the presence of human-operated vehicles. *Cooperative sensing and situational assessment capabilities, as well as action cooperation and coordination constitute the building blocks of the proposed framework. Biologically inspired computing will be considered as a strategy for enabling collective sensing, and for facilitating cooperative coordinated driving. The issues of collective sensing, cooperation and coordination will be decomposed into a simple set of behaviors, from which a more complex set of behaviors can be constructed as a function of situation complexity and driving conditions. Game theory will be used as a tool to build an overarching framework for introducing behavior dynamics that motivate cooperation and penalizes selfishness. Various group/collective behavior use-case studies will be conducted to validate the outcome of this research work, both theoretically and using simulations. Examples of use cases of interest include speed harmonization, emergency response, intersection negotiation, crash avoidance, platoons and Convoys. * The proposed research program will contribute to the training of Highly Qualified Personnel (3 at the PhD level, 4 at the MSc level, and 10 at the senior undergraduate level.). These students will be provided opportunities to gain knowledge and develop skills in advanced automotive and computing technologies. The program will positively impact road safety by reducing congestions and crashes. It will contribute to creating scientific tools for designing advanced safe-driving capabilities. It will contribute to creating jobs in software manufacturing and will enhance productivity by automating driving and minimizing congestion. Furthermore, this research program will produce technologies that can strengthen the automotive sector in Canada. *","Otman Basir, otman basir","University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo"

39,"Creative later-life in a digital age: mobilizing music and creative technologies for inclusive later-life musical learning and participation, creative expression, digital literacy, and quality of life ( 2017/18-2019/20 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/115324,"This cross-sector, interdisciplinary Partnership is focused on developing understandings of how Music and Creative Technologies (MaCT) can be applied in ways that will support inclusive opportunities for creative expression, lifelong learning and participation, and enhanced quality of later life. Our Partnership is founded upon a collaborative, critically reflective framework designed to 1) mobilize knowledge from cross-sector, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational perspectives concerning the ways in which music technology can support a creative later life; 2) expand the opportunities for creative expression through music, amongst older people; 3) deepen the learning and engagement of older people in our digital age in ways they will find meaningful and relevant; and 4) be taken up and used by caregivers and community music leaders in their professional practice. To achieve these objectives our Partnership, guided by a Steering Group and an International Research Advisory Group, brings together multifaceted expertise representing music education, music care, music technology and gerontechnology, intergenerational learning, lifelong learning, and community education. Two key societal challenges underpin our Partnership objectives. First, we are witnessing a longevity revolution whereby the global population aged 65+ is increasing markedly. The aging population represents a triumph of public health policy yet poses substantial challenges with regards to sustained quality of life, with particular issues relating to depression, loneliness, and chronic disease. In response, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated significant social, emotional, and cognitive benefits of music-making amongst senior citizens. Second, the 21st century has been distinguished by accelerated use of digital technology. Increasingly, attention has been directed towards the possibilities offered by technology for enhancing the quality of later life. However, a persistent generational digital divide has been noted. Engagement with technology within the practice of listening, playing, creating, and performing music provides a stark example of the digital divide. Although music technology with younger people is now well-established, there is limited research concerned with the use of music technology to foster positive quality of later-life. However, digital music technologies offer strong potential to: 1) serve as a vehicle whereby older people may overcome barriers to musical engagement and maximize the potential for the wider benefits of music-making to enhance their quality of life, and 2) function as a context where the generational digital divide may be mediated. Thus, recognizing the complex needs of an increasingly aging population and the potential of new creative digital technologies to meet these needs, our partnership will engage in communicative dialogue and participatory action research activities to interrogate the following critical questions: a) how can MaCT be mobilized and adapted in order to maximize equitable access in later life to creative musical expression, engagement in learning, digital literacy and quality of life amongst older citizens? b) what related knowledge and understanding can be developed in the context of intergenerational learning?; c) in what ways might emerging music technologies foster digital literacy and mitigate the generational digital divide in Canada and elsewhere?; and d) what are the risks, opportunities and related ethical questions raised by the adoption of digital music technologies in contexts focused on the care and support of older people?","Andrea R Creech, Susan A O'Neill, Isabelle Cossette, Lee Willingham, Aaron Liu-Rosenbaum, Audrey-Kristel Barbeau, Carrie C McAiney","Laval University, Simon Fraser University, McGill University, Wilfrid Laurier University, Laval University, Université du Québec à Montréal, McMaster University"

( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/216214,"The Canadian Institute of Health Research is transforming health research through commitment to community-based primary health care. This paradigm shift creates evidence-informed practices through the engagement of those with lived experience in assisting policy-makers to implement culturally-appropriate and equitable access to health services. An exploratory community-based participatory materialized through community involvement establishing a community-university partnership. The purpose of this research was to illuminate the experiences of SLFN girls in relation to 'empowerment' and 'disempowerment' to discover strategies used to foster empowerment and identify opportunities for community development. Method: The study used youth engagement and was co-facilitated and -designed by a senior participant. Overall 10 girls participated and were between the ages of 10 to 12 years old. Arts-based methods were employed to have the girls create an 'Empowerment Blueprint'; symbolizing a visual representation of empowerment in their lives. Participatory analysis was used. The findings highlight the importance of including First Nation girls' voices in the design and delivery of health promoting empowerment initiatives and the value of collaborative value-based research methods in mobilizing girls' commitment towards transforming primary health care grounded in their experiences. Aligning with CIHR's commitment to community-based primary health care, working collaborating to amplify voices of those from equity seeking groups, the girls identified barriers to empowerment as hunger and poverty influencing their health and well-being. The benefits of this exploratory study are to help illuminate how girls in SLFN experience various influences that shape their daily lives, and how they characterize these influences as empowering or disempowering to inform health promoting strategies.",Carolyn M Gaspar,Dalhousie University
43,"Dementia in the population: Trajectories of disease, health care use, and places of care ( 2016/17-2019/20 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/149842,"As the number and proportion of seniors continue to grow in Canada, the burden of dementia has become a national concern. This stems from the observation that the incidence of dementia is strongly associated with increasing age. In the 2010 report commissioned by the Alzheimer's Society of Canada - ""Rising Tide: The Impact of Dementia on Canadian Society"" - it has been predicted that dementia prevalence will more than double in the next 30 years and the cost of care will increase by ten-fold. As the prevalence of dementia increases, the need for home support and specialized housing to care for those living with the disease will likely rise in tandem. Given its implications on health care spending, as well as the health outcomes of older adults with dementia, transitions between care settings is often used as a measure of health system performance. For frail seniors, poor transitional care and multiple transitions are associated with adverse events, low satisfaction with care, and higher re-hospitalization rates. The severe cognitive deficits and responsive behaviours of older adults with dementia further increase the burden of transitions for patients and their families. Despite these issues, no previous studies have examined the full care trajectory of those with dementia, by following these patients from being in a healthy state to disease diagnosis, need for home care, admission into nursing homes, and death. In this study, we will examine transitions across health states and care settings among older adults with dementia. Results from this study will aid the development of provincial and national dementia planning models, and for the first time, to consider transitions to dementia from preventable risks and patients' progression through our health care system. This knowledge will be critical to the designs of provincial and national dementia care strategies currently under consideration.",Amy T Hsu,Ottawa Hospital Research Institute

Further, driving helps many seniors remain independent and mobile. However, to ensure the well being of older adults while at the same time maintaining public safety, we need to find a way to assess the driving abilities of senior drivers to figure out those who are safe, those who require more support or retraining, and those individuals who should no longer be on the road. For our study we will interview senior drivers in Thunder Bay and Ottawa. First, participants will complete a number of memory, vision and mobility tests. Then they will complete an assessment on a driving simulator. Finally they will do an on-road driving test with a driving instructor. The information that we collect will help us figure out the best way for health care professionals to assess senior drivers in a fair and equitable manner, ensuring they are not deprived of the driving privilege unfairly. This may have a profound effect on their quality of life by promoting independence.","Gary Naglie, Michel Bédard, Nadia W Mullen, Hillel M Finestone, Sherrilene Classen, Janice A Miller Polgar, Carrie E Gibbons, Bruce R Weaver, Nadia W Mullen, Sylvain Gagnon","Baycrest Health Sciences, Lakehead University, Lakehead University, Saint-Vincent Hospital, Western University, Western University, Lakehead Psychiatric Hospital, Lakehead University, Lakehead University, University of Ottawa"
45,Development of new biomechanical feedback tools for improving human motor skill learning and training ( 2014/15-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/20355,"We are interested in developing new tools for understanding of fundamental processes in humans and modulating various human movements, ranging from daily activities to specialized sport and music skills. Our ultimate goal is to use such technology and knowledge to improve how we move.Learning how to move is a challenging task. Even the most basic skill of walking requires years to develop and can quickly deteriorate with age and sedentary lifestyles. Age-related falls are the cause of 70% of accidental deaths in people 75 years and older and is the leading (74%) cause of hospitalization for seniors. More specialized skills such as violin playing and soccer kicking require ""talent"" and years of extensive practice to fully master. These practices can easily cause career-ending vocational diseases if conducted improperly. Our research group uses the science of biomechanics and state-of-the-art motion analysis technologies to determine which muscle movements are critical for successful skill development and which expose us to vocational disease development. In this fashion, we are able to unlock some of the secrets of talented musicians and athletes and scientifically inform music pedagogy and sports coaching, while preventing the occupational disease to occur.This particular proposal aims to develop new biomechanical tools to provide real-time feedback on how well we move. Just as heart monitors allow us to study and treat heart conditions, these biomechanical feedback tools are needed to understand and improve the training of various human motor skills. A meta-theme of the work is knowledge transfer. The proposed developments build upon the PI’s results in the fields of biomechanics, ergonomics, motor learning, and compensatory behavior of human performances and, as such, the proposed projects connect researchers, educators and practitioners to collectively improve the physical and artistic learning of our society as a whole.",Gongbing Shan,University of Lethbridge
46,Developmental Changes in (Dis)honesty: Building a Lifespan Developmental Model of Deception ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183460,"Honesty is a moral virtue that is essential in developing trusting relationships. Yet, deception is regularly used in interpersonal relationships (e.g., to protect the self, to protect others, to save face, etc.). Despite its importance, limited research has examined developmental changes in deception across the lifespan. In fact, developmental models have yet to be protracted beyond childhood, despite our knowledge that lie-telling continues to develop and change through adolescence and into adulthood. For the first time in Canada, there are more adults over the age of 65 than children, and this aging population is growing faster than any other age group. Yet, surprisingly little empirical research has studied deception with older adults. Given that aging is not simply development in reverse, understanding differences in older adulthood is critical for shedding light into the mechanisms for developing and maintaining deceptive abilities. Thus, the goal of this program of research is to discover developmental differences across adulthood in the categorization and evaluation of lies and lie-telling behaviours, as well as uncover the social-cognitive factors associated with such differences. My specific objectives are to investigate the characteristics of lie-telling during adulthood and how they differ by age (Project 1), assess age differences in the categorization and evaluation of lies throughout adulthood (Project 2), examine developmental differences in both antisocial and prosocial lie-telling behaviours (Projects 3A&B), and assess the relation between moral evaluations of (dis)honesty and lie-telling behaviours (Project 4). Across these projects I will examine the social-cognitive skills associated with such age differences. The overarching expected scholarly outcomes are to construct a comprehensive lifespan theory of the development of honesty. Theoretically, gaining insight into how developmental differences during adulthood are related to the evaluation of lies and lie-telling behaviours will provide novel insight into the mechanisms influencing moral development, which can help uncover why deceptive behaviours change across the lifespan. Practically, as social interactions with seniors are becoming more frequent, it becomes more important to understand developmental changes during adulthood. The findings from the proposed program of research can be used to help create programs for older adults around how (dis)honesty may be impacting their social relationships and social communication across age groups. As seniors tend to focus on interpersonal connections to offset life changes after retirement and to avoid isolation, such programs may be crucial for the well-being of older adults. Similarly, these findings can help educate those who work with seniors (e.g., social workers, healthcare professionals), to help explain the motivations behind seniors' (dis)honest behaviours. Further, understanding the mechanisms behind deceptive behaviours may help inform methods for detecting deception and promoting honesty. As such, these findings will be communicated broadly (to academics, practitioners, and the general public) so that major findings can aid in the development of policy and social programs to support aging populations.",Angela D Evans,Brock University
47,Diagnostic Imaging at the Point-of-Care: A Possible Role for Paramedics? ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/148707,"Older adults with two or more chronic diseases and/or functional disability often have difficulty accessing adequate healthcare in their home. Predictably, many end-up receiving care in the hospital emergency department. In hospital, these older adults often suffer additional problems (infection, falls) which are potentially avoidable and from which they may never recover. Well organized home-based healthcare can be used to successfully manage common medical conditions in older adults (pneumonia, chronic heart failure), may lead to better or similar health outcomes, lower healthcare costs, and is often better supported by patients. However, home care clinicians often require access to medical diagnostic tests not often available at home. When an urgent medical situation arises, the majority of older adults must go out-of-home to obtain required tests and treatment. Recent research showed a large number of older adults who call emergency medical services (9-1-1 in Canada) but were not admitted to hospital receive x-rays as part of their diagnostic tests. A large number (36%) of emergency room visits by long-term care patients were for pneumonia or falls. York Region Paramedic Services is interested in determining whether x-rays, or other diagnostic imaging methods (ultrasound), could be a service provided by paramedics. If diagnostic imaging is provided at the point-of-care, in theory this diagnostic result could aid clinicians in better understanding a patient's medical condition and help guide the next care approach (is a visit to the emergency department really needed?). This project examines the risks and benefits of providing diagnostic imaging at home and identifies the possible roles paramedics can play. The project outcome will help York Region Paramedic Services make an informed decision based on evidence to determine the preferred paramedic role in providing diagnostic imaging out-of-hospital in urgent situations.",Victoria Young,University of Toronto

The gut microbiota (bacteria in the intestine) is now recognized as a major factor that influence the development of obesity and T2D, and alterations in gut microbiota composition can affect inflammation, insulin sensitivity, and glucose homeostasis. Over time, the gut bacteria and their fragments may past the leaky gut of obese diabetic animals, accumulating and even colonizing the blood and extra-intestinal tissues. However, whether translocation of microbes and microbial products also occurs in human obesity and T2D, especially in metabolic tissues (e.g fat, liver) is still unclear. The overarching goal of this team grant application is to establish an innovative and interdisciplinary microbiome research program, building upon our existing complementary expertise, integrating new concepts and state-of-the-art technologies. This will involve interdisciplinary collaborations from both clinical and basic scientists from 5 universities across Canada and will include substantive contributions from a well balanced mix of early-career, mid-career and senior investigators that will team-up to deliver the following objectives: 1) Define the human gut microbiome of type 2 diabetic (T2D) individuals and determine its impact on gut health and glucose control; 2) Determine the role of human microbes breaching to gut and reaching the circulation and metabolic tissues in the pathogensis of T2D, and the underlying mechanisms by which those microbes can induce complications; and 3) Determine the impact of those human microbiome as key modifiers of the responses to dietary and drug treatments.","André Marette, Jonathan D Schertzer, Frederic Raymond, Caroline K Kramer, Tony K Lam, Michael G Surette, David Z Cherney, Jessica T Yue, Gary Sweeney, Patrick Mathieu, Lesley T MacNeil, Denis Richard, Daniel A Winer, Vincenzo Di Marzo, André Tchernof","Laval University, McMaster University, Laval University, University of Toronto, University Health Network, McMaster University, University of Toronto, University of Alberta, York University, Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Québec, McMaster University, Laval University, University Health Network, Laval University, Laval University"
50,Dissection of Tumorigenic and Inflammatory Signaling Pathways to Identify Novel Therapeutic Approaches ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147583,"Tak W. Mak is a global leader in immunology and cancer research. His lab uses genetically modified mice to dissect molecular mechanisms of cancer and immune disorders and characterize molecules that can potentially be targeted to treat disease. The overarching direction of this CIHR Foundation proposal encompasses basic and translational research on new therapeutic targets related to genomic instability, metabolic adaptation, inflammation, or metastasis. The goal is to generate a pipeline of novel agents and perform the preclinical and animal studies required to funnel these drug candidates into clinical trials. This multi-pronged program is designed to identify, characterize and validate new targets, and develop novel biomarker-driven agents against them. Clinical translation of these results may offer concrete treatment options to the many cancer patients who still die of their disease despite recent advances in cancer therapies. This CIHR Foundation proposal contains four Pillars. Pillar I is “Exploitation of genomic instability in cancer cells”, which will focus on two existing inhibitors of genomic instability, generate additional inhibitors, identify biomarkers, and devise rational drug combinations. Pillar II is “Exploitation of metabolic changes in cancer cells”,which will study the effects of IDH mutations on tumorigenesis as well as drugs targeting mutated IDH enzymes. Pillar III is “Investigation of the role of the inflammatory molecule HMGB1 in tumorigenesis”,which will characterize mice bearing unique HMGB1 mutations with an eye to future clinical intervention. Pillar IV is “Identification of factors essential for tumor cell dormancy and metastasis”,which will validate relevant targets and characterize inhibitory mAbs. Dr. Mak is the Project Leader of this proposal. As of February 2015, his h-index is 149 and his lifetime citation count is >84,0001. He has been awarded 20 honorary degrees and 33 academic prizes, and holds >30 patents. He collaborates with outstanding investigators, who will bring to this program skills in basic/translational/clinical oncology, inflammation, metastasis, mouse tumor models, in vivo high through-put screening, drug discovery, molecular pathology, stem cell biology, genomics, epigenomics, and computational biology. Two biotechnology companies will provide investigational IDH inhibitors or synthesize mAbs. Dr. Mak fosters the development of exceptional scientists, and many of his >150 trainees are leaders in academia and industry. An estimated minimum of 20 postdoctoral fellows, 4 clinician-scientists, 6 graduate students and 8 research technicians will receive training during this program. Trainees will work in a technologically superior, multidisciplinary environment that includes access to translational and drug discovery methodologies. Trainees interact daily with senior Mak lab members, participate in weekly lab meetings and monthly theme meetings, and consult regularly with Dr. Mak and external experts. Guidance on experimental design and execution, as well as the preparation of high impact publications and grant proposals, will be provided. Trainees will present seminars on their work in-house, at affiliated institutes, and at national and international conferences. In conclusion, this proposal has the potential to generate novel and biomarker-driven anticancer therapeutics as well as increase Canada’s complement of basic and translational researchers and clinical oncologists.",Tak W Mak,University Health Network
51,Disseminating Nursing Informatics Competencies for Canadian Nurse Leaders ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215130,"Many Canadian healthcare organizations have implemented, or are in the process of implementing eHealth systems, like electronic health record systems, to enhance efficiency, effectiveness and safety, as well as support patient participation, education and empowerment. Unfortunately, these organizations have not consistently taken full advantage of their eHealth systems, and therefore many of the potential benefits to patients, families, health professionals, and the healthcare system remain unseen.One explanation for why these benefits have not have been realized is that nurses in Canada have rarely contributed to their design, selection, adoption, use or evaluation despite being the single largest user group of these systems. Nurses, particularly those in senior leadership roles (e.g., Chief Nursing Officer), have the capacity to influence the selection, implementation, use, and evaluation of technologies in a way that could lead to numerous clinical benefits. The aims of the proposed activities are to: 1) Disseminate findings of studies that have identified informatics competencies of importance to Canadian nurse leaders to relevant stakeholder audiences; 2) Obtain the perspectives of nurse leaders on appropriate dissemination strategies for the identified informatics competencies; and, 3) Explore practical strategies for how healthcare organizations, nursing schools and professional nursing organizations can support the dissemination of these competencies.","Leanne Currie, Gillian Strudwick, Brian F Lo, Lynn M Nagle","University of British Columbia, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, University of New Brunswick"
52,Does the BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program improve the dietary behaviours and psychosocial well-being of low-income adults? ( 2018/19-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/180001,"Healthy eating is important for good health. However, many low-income Canadians cannot afford to buy enough healthy food. The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program gives low-income seniors and young families 16 weeks of coupons worth $15/week to buy healthy foods in farmers' markets and teaches them about healthy eating. It is not clear if the program is meeting its goals of improving the diets, well-being and health of low-income adults because its impacts have not been studied. This research will study the impact of the BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program on what people eat, and their social and mental well-being. It will also try to understand how the program makes these changes and how the program can be improved. We will use a strong study design that can show cause and effect. We will study these things by asking 200 adults who are in the program, and 200 adults who are not in the program, to tell us about the foods they eat, their social relationships, stress levels and general mental well-being. All of these questions will be asked before the program starts, right after it ends, and 16 weeks after it has ended so that we can understand how these things changed during and after the program. A smaller group of 40 adults will be interviewed about their experiences in the program to help us understand how any changes happened, and how the program can be improved. The BC Farmers' Market Nutrition Coupon Program is paid for by taxpayers and so it is important to find out if it is actually helping to improve people's diets and well-being. Information from this study will help the BC government and the BC Association of Farmers' Markets to understand if the program is meeting its goals, how it is doing so, and how the program can be improved. This information can also be used by governments in other provinces and countries to decide if they should start their own farmers' market nutrition coupon programs.","Lindsay Mclaren, Dana Lee Olstad, Shauna M Downs, Kylie Ball, Candace Nykiforuk, Gavin R McCormack, Leia Minaker, Erin Faught, Jennifer L Black, Tolulope T Sajobi, Candace Nykiforuk","University of Calgary, University of Calgary, Rutgers University, Deakin University, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Waterloo, University of Calgary, University of British Columbia, University of Calgary, University of Alberta"
53,Dyscorpia: Intersections of the Body and Technology ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184094,"Advancements in biomedicine and digital technology have done much to improve human health and welfare, but this field of scientific innovation has also raised complex legal, ethical and philosophical questions that Canadian society must address. Cutting-edge digital technology and research in the health sciences is upsetting the foundations of liberal democracies, impacting issues around privacy, equality, and the democratic process itself. Perhaps more significantly, these emerging technologies are challenging the very idea of what it means to be human or to have consciousness - particularly in relation to the rapidly expanding field of artificial intelligence. Much of the discourse around these pressing issues can become highly polarized and complex, with the media presenting issues in simplistic black and white terms. Art and creative research has an important role to play in these debates because of its capacity to articulate nuanced emotions, such as anxiety and hope, in a manner that compliments and expands on knowledge translation occurring in other modes of communication, such as academic journals. In this and other ways, creative work can foster knowledge and understanding alongside science that enables society to envision positive responses to technological innovation. Dyscorpia: Future Intersections of the Body and Technology is an innovative interdisciplinary project that brings together creative and academic researchers including scientists, musicians, cultural theorists and visual artists in order to examine the ways contemporary society is reframing the body through precision medicine, artificial intelligence and evolving imaging and communications technologies. Over the last two years this interdisciplinary team has been working collaboratively to produce both academic writing and creative works that investigate the complex ways technology is shifting perceptions on humanity and the human body, as well as speculating on how this technology will transform the body of the future. Funding for this SSHRC Connections Grant will be used to support two public exhibitions of visual/sonic art works, literature, and academic writing, produced by the Dyscorpia research team, as well as invited senior undergraduate and graduate students. Alongside the first of these exhibitions we will also hold a one-day public symposium, and produce a publication of academic writing that will feature reproductions of the research-creation produced in the context of the project. The first exhibition and symposium will take place at Enterprise Square Gallery from (April 20 -- May 15) in downtown Edmonton. Once the initiative in Edmonton is complete, a selection of works will be sent for a second exhibition to the Jyvaskyla Art Museum, Jyvaskyla, Finland and Corps Secrets in Montreal. Professors Caulfield and Oliver will travel to Jyvaskyla to participate in workshops and talks in conjunction with this exhibition. The project leaders for this initiative, Professors Caulfield, Ensslin, and Oliver, all have extensive experience organizing symposiums and exhibitions, including interdisciplinary projects such as Perceptions of Promise, The Body in Question(s), and Immune Nations. One important success that links all of these previous initiatives has been their capacity to foster increased discourse among diverse communities, both within and outside the academy, that do not normally interact. This new interdisciplinary research-creation project will also foster this kind of important cross-community dialogue, raising Canada's profile as an important site for interdisciplinary work exploring the intersections between technology, biomedicine and visual art.","Sean T Caulfield, Astrid C Ensslin, Marilene J Oliver","University of Alberta, University of Alberta, University of Alberta"
57,Electrical and metabolic manifestations of human focal epilepsy ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147870,"Overarching direction. Many patients with focal epilepsy are refractory to medical treatment. Surgical treatment is then the only option. Defining the region to resect is complex and far from fool proof. Some patients cannot be operated because the focus is not found; in operated patients, the success varies from 40 to 80% according to many factors, most of which are uncertain.My research will center on the concept that human focal epilepsy is not a single uniform disease as most often considered today, but that it is possible to create a classification of focal epilepsies that will lead to improved treatment and a higher probability of finding different underlying mechanisms. Following recent results in experimental temporal lobe epilepsy, with initial confirmation in patients, I propose to define different classes of focal epilepsy, each corresponding to a cluster of features derived from seizure symptoms, imaging/pathological substrate, and functional imaging and electrophysiological signatures. These classes will be related to success/failure of different surgical resections as currently performed, allowing us to provide patients and physicians with critical information about future surgeries: likelihood of success, guidance for resection, and when surgery is not recommended. The classes of focal epilepsy will also define phenotypes that can be studied experimentally, possibly uncovering mechanisms specific to each.Methods. Electrophysiology is the core investigation, reflecting directly the abnormal neuronal activity of epileptic discharges and seizures. We have been among pioneers discovering a new EEG activity, High Frequency Oscillations (HFOs), and demonstrated that HFOs provide better diagnostic information and help understand mechanisms of ictogenesis and epileptogenesis. We will now add single cell recordings combined with human EEG to discover the neural mechanisms likely to underlie epileptic discharges. Structural MR imaging provides the location and possible pathological substrate of the lesion that may cause the epilepsy, in patients showing a lesion. Functional imaging, principally EEG-fMRI, which we also pioneered, provides a unique view of the whole brain at the time of epileptic discharges, allowing the delineation of the epileptic focus as well as network abnormalities.Health outcome. This research should result in a better understanding of focal epilepsy, better outcome of surgery, and possibly investigation into specific mechanisms for the different classes of focal epilepsy that we will define.Core expertise. I have considerable experience in all the areas indicated above, as a pioneer in electrophysiological and functional imaging studies of human epilepsy. I have long-standing collaborations with Program Experts: F. Dubeau, senior epilepsy clinician and neurophysiologist with considerable experience in imaging; M. Avoli, senior neuroscientist and world leader in experimental epilepsy; C. Grova, young investigator specialized in the analysis of EEG and fMRI; and J. Hall, neurosurgeon active in the investigation and surgical treatment of epileptic patients.Mentoring.

58,Elucidating the molecular mechanisms of regulation of cellular stress sensors ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/206057,"Responses to stress are an integral part of organism's physiology and biology. Adaptation to stressful conditions is a decisive advantage in the evolutionary struggle for existence. The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a centrally located intracellular organelle responsible for many housekeeping functions including the synthesis, folding of proteins and lipids, the storage and release of intracellular calcium. Disruption of ER function caused by many intrinsic or extrinsic factors culminates in ER stress, and the ER mounts a coping response [e.g., unfolded protein response (UPR)] to mitigate or eliminate the stress. The UPR pathways sense ER disturbance and involves distinct components designed to re-establish the protein synthetic machinery, including translational attenuation, transcriptional activation of genes encoding chaperones and components of the ER-associated degradation, and activation of apoptotic and autophagy pathways. There are three ER transmembrane stress sensors that comprise the UPR reaction to ER stress: PERK, ATF6, and IRE1, integral ER proteins with luminal stress sensing domains. Our research program is focused on identifying the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of cellular stress sensors.******Long-term objectives of this research are to generate fundamental knowledge regarding molecular mechanisms of stress sensors and to provide unique training opportunity for HQP engaged in the program. Regulation of the luminal sensor domain of UPR by the ER luminal environment remains poorly understood. This research program was initiated in 2014 to address this knowledge gap. We discovered that ER resident proteins (oxidoreductase, cyclooxygenase and calsequestrin) bind to ER luminal stress sensing domain of IRE to affect its cellular signaling. However, the molecular mechanisms governing these interactions are not known. Furthermore, regulation of other ER stress sensors remains to be examined. To address these our research program has three themes focused on reconstituting the mechanistic events in vitro, using recombinant IRE1, PERK and ATF6 luminal domain, in the presence of relevant ER resident proteins; and assessing whether ER luminal environment is involved in this process.******Theme 1. Determine the nature of ER luminal stress sensors***Theme 2. Examine molecular regulation of PERK and ATF6 ER stress sensors***Theme 3. Determine biological importance of ER stress sensors regulation******This research program will yield new insights on ER stress sensors biology, the importance of molecular interaction in stress sensing, as well as advance our general understanding of ER stress coping responses. We also provide outstanding environment for training of HQP in technologies and skills desired by industry and academic job sectors.

59,"Enhancing community participation in Canadians with physical disabilities: development, implementation and evaluation of a partnered strategy ( 2013/14-2019/20 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107205,"Canadians with physical disabilities do not fully enjoy the UN-protected basic right to ""full and effective participation and inclusion in society."" Indeed, many Canadians with physical disabilities report disrupted levels of participation in several important aspects of community life such as employment, sports and active recreation, and simply being able to move about their communities independently and with dignity (i.e., community mobility). As a result, not only do people with physical disabilities have lower rates of community participation than their able-bodied counterparts, their quality of participation (e.g., enjoyment, satisfaction) is also poorer. The goal of our 7-year program of research and knowledge mobilization (KM) is to enhance the quantity and quality of community participation among Canadians living with physical disabilities by developing, mobilizing and evaluating theory- and evidence-based strategies to enhance community participation. Our research and KM program will focus on three community participation domains that people with physical disabilities consistently identify as being the most restrictive, as well as the domains in which they most desire greater participation: employment, mobility, and sports. In addition to addressing the number (i.e., quantity) of people who participate, our efforts will also focus on understanding and enhancing the psychosocial quality of participation (e.g., feelings of meaningful engagement, autonomy, responsibility, and social connectedness). Specific research and KM projects are designed around fundamental, evidence-based principles of KM and will address the following themes: (1) describing and understanding participation, its barriers and facilitators in the disability community, (2) Identifying effective KM methods, (3) Creating interventions/practices to enhance participation, and (4) Implementing & evaluating the interventions/practices. These thematic objectives will be addressed for each community participation domain addressed in this proposal: Employment, Mobility, & Sport. Some projects will be conducted in a single domain, while several projects cut across domains, integrating researchers from different fields of study. Research and KM activities will be carried out by an international multidisciplinary, cross-sectoral partnership that synergizes the research expertise of over 20 junior- mid- and senior-career academics, with the front-line experience of 20 community-based disability-related service groups, organizations, foundations and a private sector partner with mandates to advocate for and assist Canadians with disabilities to achieve full community participation. Community and academic partners will work together to address community-driven research questions, co-creating new knowledge that can be turned into products, tools and services, that partners can take ownership and pride in using and disseminating. Our program of ongoing collaboration and mutual learning will foster innovative research, training, and new knowledge that will be rapidly and effectively disseminated to key stakeholders. Indeed, our partnership is poised to generate social science research that will have a profound impact on community participation among the nearly 3 million Canadians living with physical disabilities. The social and economic significance of these activities cannot be overstated; when people with physical disabilities are full participants in their communities, all Canadians benefit from a stronger, more competitive society in which everyone can use their talents, skills and resources.

In addition to public health measures including physical distancing, many patients who perceive hospitals as high-risk environments and may avoid emergency department visits, even when seriously ill. This can lead to health issues becoming worse and harder to manage. Harms associated with decreased emergency department use may be greater for some populations, who rely more heavily on emergency departments for their care. Frequent users of emergency departments are more likely to be low income and to be older. In Alberta and British Columbia, First Nations individuals utilize emergency departments at a much higher rate than non-First Nations individuals. This study builds on an existing emergency medicine research partnership with the Alberta First Nations Information Governance Centre, as well as connections to operational (Alberta Health Services) and research leaders in the areas of emergency medicine, seniors care and population health. Through information collected by the Alberta health system, we will compare emergency department use during the initial months of the pandemic to information collected last year. Among other outcomes, we will consider how numbers of ED visits, hospital admissions, deaths in ED and other serious conditions have changed during the pandemic. We will then determine if changes have been greater for First Nations, socially and materially deprived, remote and older populations than for the general population. Through structured engagement with patients, clinicians and health systems leaders, we will share findings and develop understandings of results.

Significant obstacles remain, particularly with regards to the challenges associated with optimizing treatment and care planning for a population that typically present to healthcare with a number of complex and co-occurring conditions (e.g., HIV, viral hepatitis, mental health issues). The growing investment in AI presents a unique opportunity to redefine how data is used in health, with potential for significant impact on patient care and the health of populations. While holding great promise, it is unclear what the societal implications are when applying these technologically advanced approaches to population and public health, particularly as it pertains to traditionally marginalized populations such as people living with SUD.

Although hoarding appears on the surface (and perhaps on TV shows) to be a simple problem of poor housekeeping, the disorder involves substantial functional impairment including severe social isolation and inability to sustain minimal standards of home maintenance. Seniors and low-income renters are particularly vulnerable to threat of eviction and accidents in the home. The hallmark symptom of hoarding disorder is extreme emotional distress about, and avoidance of, discarding objects most people would let go of. As a result, the home becomes too full to use some or all of the rooms for their intended purpose. Possessions in the home become extremely disorganized, with important (e.g., passport) and unimportant (e.g., out-dated sales flyers) items mixed together. Intervention for hoarding is complex, and the most effective intervention tested thus far has shown only modest effects despite an enormous investment of resources. Limited understanding of the cognitive processes involved in decisions to acquire and discard possessions in turn limits the degree to which treatment can effectively target these processes. This research will determine the cognitive underpinnings of two key features of hoarding: excessive valuing of objects and extreme disorganization of the home. Five studies are proposed to investigate aspects of cognitive functioning as they relate to hoarding behaviour. In relation to the psychology of ownership, we focus on attention and memory as well as specific types of judgment and decision-making. We also examine whether hoarding involves deficits in executive functioning (e.g., concept formation, impulse control). The results will directly impact the development of more efficacious and cost-effective approaches to treatment as well as provide clues into the neuroscience behind hoarding and related disorders.","Sheila R Woody, Daniel Bartels, Todd C Handy, Mahesh Menon","University of British Columbia, University of Chicago, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia"
63,Extending the validation and reliability testing of SCREEN a nutrition risk screening tool for community-living seniors. ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/230101,"In the past 20 years there has been a rapid growth in the number of persons living with cognitive impairment or dementia in the community. Similarly, retirement homes have grown in prominence as a way of providing care for those who can no longer live independently. Both of these groups are prone to nutrition problems; poor food intake and weight loss are associated with several adverse outcomes such as falls and hospitalizations, as well as the progression of dementia. Determining which older adults are at nutrition risk will allow the health care system to target interventions and start early treatment that can improve their overall health and independence. Yet, nutrition screening tools specific to these groups are unavailable. SCREEN is a questionnaire that was created in Canada and is used worldwide to measure nutrition risk. However, SCREEN was not tested in those with cognitive impairment or living in retirement residences. The proposed study will determine if SCREEN is valid for use with these two groups of community-living seniors. Persons living with cognitive impairment (and their family member) and persons living in retirement homes will be recruited. Participants (~ 600) will complete SCREEN and other health measures and a dietitian will determine the nutrition risk of the participant based on an assessment. SCREEN results will be compared to this assessment to determine if it adequately represents nutrition risk. Availability of a feasible nutrition risk tool that can be used with all community-living seniors, including those with dementia and/or living in retirement homes will promote screening in family doctors' offices, retirement homes and other clinics, which is currently absent. Early identification of nutrition problems will promote the development and use of preventative services to improve senior health, potentially delaying or avoiding frailty and increased use of healthcare services by these vulnerable older adults.","Heather H Keller, George A Heckman, Linda Lee, Christina O Lengyel, Marina Mourtzakis, Jill M Morrison, Alison M Duncan","University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, McMaster University, University of Manitoba, University of Waterloo, University of Waterloo, University of Guelph"
65,Financial disclosures and corporate governance ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183441,"Shares and bonds of publicly traded corporations are the largest avenues for citizens' savings and investments. These corporations are so important that their aggregate market capitalization exceeds nation's income. However, they are characterized by the separation of ownership and control. Their equity shares may be owned by millions of widely dispersed individuals, called shareholders, but their operations are controlled by a small group of professional managers. This separation causes a divergence of interests between managers and shareholders. For example, managers may prefer to spend surplus cash on assets that increase the size of the corporation in order to enjoy better perquisites that come with managing a larger company, even if the larger size comes at the cost of pursuing unprofitable projects. However, the widely dispersed, atomistic shareholders have little direct influence over the company's affairs, to check managers' behavior. Public shareholders use two policy instruments to protect their interests. First, they elect a board of directors that controls, monitors, and guides managers on their behalf. Of particular importance are outside directors who are independent and not the executives of their governed companies. Second, investors seek financial reports, which consist of accounting numbers calculated using generally accepted accounting (GAAP). In addition, firms provide textual narratives to explain their business and reported numbers. Those narratives, also called disclosures, convey relevant information to shareholders. But, they also reduce a firm's competitive advantage by revealing sensitive information to its competitors. Outside directors, representing a potent governance mechanism, might enable a firm to reach the right balance between the costs and benefits of voluntary disclosures. Past literature finds mixed and controversial evidence on the association between outside directors and voluntary corporate disclosures. We hypothesize that the outside directors do not represent a homogeneous group of people as previously considered in the literature. An outside director's professional expertise and experience could shape her assessment of costs and benefits of disclosures as well as the investors' demands for disclosures. We plan to examine a sample of biotechnology firms to examine whether the aforesaid association differs based on directors' professional backgrounds. We shall hand-collect data on their professional backgrounds and classify them into three categories. Business experts are current or past senior officers of other companies. Support specialists (e.g., consultants, lawyers, or bankers) are experts in functional areas and are managers at their own ""vertical"" companies. Community influentials lack both senior management and general business experience, but they provide non-business perspectives on issues, problems and ideas. We shall identify whether the influence of outside directors on firm characteristics differs based on the background characteristics of outside directors. Since the board of directors and financial disclosures are among the most potent mechanisms to protect shareholder interests, our study will have policy implications. It might suggest that organizations seeking to promote corporate governance by creating optimal board structures, such as the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS) and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), must not treat all outside directors as equal. Instead, they must consider the outside directors' professional backgrounds, to be consistent with the governed firms' innate or targeted disclosure polices.","Anup Srivastava, Luminita Enache","University of Calgary, University of Calgary"
66,For-profit firms in emerging markets: their role and impact in creating market-based institutions ( 2015/16-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107561,"The proposed research addresses the role of for-profit firms in creating market-based institutions in emerging markets. Our core premise is that for-profit firms, both alone and in collaboration with other partners, are crucial in supporting market-based institutions that foster business activity, such as capital markets, legal institutions, labour markets, regulatory regimes, and commercial value chains. We aim to develop a deeper understanding of how firms in emerging markets mobilize knowledge and form partnerships to develop and grow. In doing so, we will study how private actors function as institutional intermediaries that create targeted commercial institutions for the benefit of private interests as well as more broadly-based institutions that serve public interests. Through this approach, we seek to highlight innovative approaches to value creation in emerging markets and consider how they may also benefit Canada and other developed countries through new business practices and partnerships. The research will explore the following three types of non-governmental intermediation: 1. Local firms as institutional intermediaries: How do private firms in emerging markets gather knowledge-based resources that they need to grow and, in turn, how do the new resources contribute to the creation of market-based institutions? 2. Academic-commercial linkages as institutional intermediaries: How does knowledge from academic activity in emerging markets diffuse to businesses in those countries, including new firms, established domestic firms, and foreign firms operating in the countries? 3. For-profit -- non-profit partnerships as institutional intermediaries: How do partnerships of for-profit firms with public actors and/or non-profit private actors in emerging markets enable the development of market-based institutions?"" The potential contribution is the creation of knowledge about how emerging market firms form linkages between private actors to mobilize knowledge and facilitate business activities in these settings. We will explore the potential impact of different types of institutional intermediation in supporting robust markets and social safety nets within emerging markets, while also considering how these innovative business practices may foster globally competitive industries and provide innovative templates for business practice in Canada and other traditional developed markets. The research will be guided by theories of institutional intermediation, value creation in emerging markets, knowledge translation, organizational partnerships, entrepreneurship, business and capability formation, market development, and business innovation. We will test our propositions empirically through both qualitative field research and quantitative analysis. Senior scholars working in the field in collaboration with post-doctoral fellows and doctoral students will conduct the proposed research. Our goal is to prepare a series of publications in the literature on management and strategy that can serve as the foundation of insights that are relevant for entrepreneurs, for-profit firms, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, and policy-makers. In particular, we hope to identify how private firms in emerging markets contribute to and shape domestic and global markets and foster innovative business practices. Our expectation is that the research will generate insights that can be captured by Canadians and others interested in adopting best practices in management, strategy, and innovation.","Anita M McGahan, William G Mitchell","University of Toronto, University of Toronto"
67,Frailty assessment for older adults at points of care: Validating the electronic comprehensive geriatric assessment / frailty index (eFI-CGA) ( 2018/19-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/182219,"Frailty is characterized by loss of biological reserves across multiple organ systems resulting in an increased risk of death and other adverse outcomes. Mounting evidence suggests frailty may be modifiable and can be prevented and sometimes even reversed. Frailty guidelines recommend the early identification of frailty in ""at risk"" seniors to address modifiable variables. The Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) is a well-established clinical tool used to determine older adults' medical, psychological, and functional capabilities. It provides key baseline data for identifying degrees of risk and establishing individual care plans. A deficit accumulation based frailty index can be calculated using CGA items (FI-CGA). Key to care planning, the FI-CGA precisely measures the level of frailty. Performing a CGA and calculating an FI-CGA typically requires extra work for front-line clinicians. Electronic healthcare tools offer a more time efficient, cost-effective alternative. In partnership with the world's experts in frailty, our team conducted a pilot study to develop an electronic CGA in the Electronic Medical Records system and to automate the simultaneous calculation of an eFI-CGA in primary care and family medicine. The EMR allows widespread use across the healthcare system, making an eCGA and eFI-CGA an example of how to provide efficient care for older adults. This project aims to establish the reliability and validity of the eFI-CGA for widespread use in the management of older adults (e.g. identifying at-risk individuals and monitoring frailty changes in relation to short-, medium-, and long-term outcomes). Determining the eFI-CGA to be a reliable and valid measurement of frailty may help healthcare providers make more meaningful and comprehensive healthcare decisions; improve patients' clinical outcomes and self-management competence; reducing costly hospital admissions and prolonged stays by providing a better chance to address frailty at an early stage.","Kenneth Rockwood, Ryan C D'Arcy, Olga Theou, Robert C McDermid, Samar Hejazi","Dalhousie University, Simon Fraser University, Dalhousie University, University of British Columbia, University Hospital"
68,Geophysical mechanisms governing particle transport by wind ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/211026,"Wind is ubiquitous at Earth's surface, as well as on other planetary bodies such as Mars, Venus and Titan. Where any source of loose particles exists, the fluid drag of the wind may entrain and carry some fraction of these particles over distances varying from just a few millimeters to several meters and ultimately in the case of dust in long-term suspension, over thousands of kilometers. As such, the transport of these particles may affect air quality, visibility, the absorption and transmission of solar radiation, climate, soil fertility, and through deposition, surface topography (e.g. dunes). *** While technically any form of particle can be transported in an airflow, my long-term research program funded by the NSERC Discovery Grant program is primarily focused upon natural sedimentary particles. My principal methodological approach is founded on the use of a boundary-layer wind tunnel to study the geophysical processes that govern particulate matter (PM) transport in air flows. Less than a half dozen such facilities in the world are typically engaged in work of this type at any given point in time. The Trent Environmental Wind Tunnel (TEWT) is distinguished as supporting one of the longest standing and most continuous research programs investigating (aeolian) sedimentary processes. It also is the only one of its type to be located in an environmental chamber with full climate control down to subfreezing temperatures. Laser based technologies available within TEWT include Particle Tracking Velocimetry (PTV) for investigating particle dynamics; Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) for sampling the properties of the airflow structure and particle kinetic; and LiDAR for mapping the surface morphometry.*** The proposed work will use the leading-edge technologies available within TEWT to investigate: i) the dynamics of discrete particle impacts and ejections during their transport across wet and frozen sedimentary bed surfaces, ii) particle impact, splash, creep and segregation during the inception, growth and migration of ballistic ripples as found on a range of planetary surfaces, iii) the role of turbulence generation in dust emission and dispersion, and iv) the role of aggregate disintegration in dust generation. Each of these studies will increase understanding of the geophysical system, provide direct measurements for the parameterization and calibration of various sediment transport and dust emission models, and may ultimately lead to improvements in practices that aim to mitigate wind erosion and improve air quality. Training will be provided for six graduate students (2 PhD and 4 MSc) and five senior undergraduate thesis students, who will undertake this work and contribute to its dissemination through conference presentations and publication. *****",Cheryl MckennaNeuman,Trent University
69,Global Histories of Youth in the Modern Age ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184108,"A glance at today's headlines reveals a world in turmoil, in which a striking number of those involved are adolescents and young adults. The overall goal of ""Global Histories of Youth in the Modern Age"" is to come to grips with our current moment by rethinking the history of youth -- a subject of compelling contemporary importance that has generally been analyzed in regional and nation-based frameworks -- in global terms. The specific objectives of this outreach activity are: 1) To make meaningful contributions to academic and public discussions about young people's relationship to conflict, colonialism, economic and technological change, culture, and mobility, as well as to broader debates about global and transnational history and age as a category of analysis; 2) To provide high quality training and mentorship opportunities for graduate students at the University of Lethbridge; and 3) To encourage international collaboration and networking. Focusing on the period between c.1918 and 2018, ""Global Histories of Youth in the Modern Age"" will allow University of Lethbridge graduate students and a group of accomplished invited scholars who study or are based in Australia, Canada, England, France, Hong Kong, India, Germany, Japan, Lebanon, Nigeria, Russia, Scotland, and the United States to think collaboratively and in new ways about how young people have shaped and been shaped by global currents and events. This initiative will include a public lecture on ""Youth in Conflict: 1918-2018"" by Dr. Mischa Honeck, Senior Lecturer in History at Humboldt University-Berlin, and a two-day workshop devoted to in-depth discussions about global approaches to the history of young people. The workshop will feature rigorous discussions of pre-circulated papers and research posters by invited scholars and University of Lethbridge graduate students on subjects including concepts of youth; education and labour; leisure and play; migration; sexuality; authority and agency; and the emotions. Post-workshop outcomes will include a graduate student-produced podcast and a blog post, co-authored by the Principal Investigator Dr. Kristine Alexander and ULethbridge graduate students, for the ""Commentaries"" section of the website of the international Society for the History of Children and Youth (shcy.org). The final and most significant outcome of this project will be the edited collection A Cultural History of Youth in the Modern Age, co-edited by Dr. Alexander and Dr. Simon Sleight, Senior Lecturer in History at King's College London (under contract with Bloomsbury with an anticipated submission date of January 2020). This book will feature expanded and revised versions of the papers presented and discussed in person during the workshop. Together, these activities will stimulate public and academic debate about the political, social, cultural, and ideological importance of youth in local and global settings between the end of the First World War and the present day. Our broad temporal scope is particularly innovative, as historians of young people have been reluctant to move their analyses beyond the turning point of the late 1960s. We will contribute to new research about age as a category of analysis by drawing out the different ways transitions to adulthood a) intersect with gender, race, class, and ability, and b) have been experienced and understood across time and space. The public lecture, workshop, podcast, blog post, and edited volume will also bring different place-based histories into conversation with each other, thereby engaging more explicitly than have other studies with the insights and interpretive methods of transnational and global history.",Kristine Alexander,University of Lethbridge
71,Health Workforce Education and Training Resources to Recognize and Support Family Caregivers of Seniors in Care ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/182213,"The Canadian population is aging. Over 6.2 million Canadians are now 65 years of age or older. Although many seniors are active, healthy, and live independently, others are in need of health services and help with activities of daily living. More than 8 million Canadians provide care to a family member or friend, with more than 1 million of these caregivers over 65 years of age. The ongoing care duties place stress on caregivers' physical, mental, and social health. While providing ongoing care for a senior with a disability or chronic disease, these family caregivers meet with many kinds of healthcare professionals (HCPs). The Covenant Health Network of Excellence in Seniors' Health and Wellness aims to ensure the delivery of high quality care for seniors and their families. Dr. Parmar and the research team, with the support of the Network, have held meetings with over 300 national and international stakeholders on this topic of family caregiving. The results of the meetings identified a need to train and empower HCPs to formally recognize and support family caregivers. Our goal is to develop health workforce education and training resources to enable HCPs to recognize and support family caregivers of seniors in care. This proposed project has three objectives: (1) to develop the content for the educational and training resources; (2) to design and create the resources; and (3) to develop a strategic plan for the use and distribution of the resources. To meet our objectives, we will hold a 2-day, interactive, in-person meeting with family caregivers, HCPs, educators, managers, members of caregiver organizations, researchers, and international representatives. Pre-meeting activities involve developing the draft content for the training resources. Post-meeting activities will focus on the creation and distribution of the resources. The education and training resources will target the gap between family caregiver needs and HCP support for family caregivers.","Jenny Ploeg, Jayna M Holroyd-Leduc, Suzette C Bremault-Phillips, Jasneet Parmar, Wendy Duggleby, Vivian Ewa, Konrad Fassbender, Lesley Charles, Bonnie M Dobbs, Cheryl Pollard, Wonita Janzen, Vivian Ewa","McMaster University, University of Calgary, University of Alberta, University of Alberta, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, University of Alberta, University of Alberta, University of Alberta, Grant MacEwan University, University of Alberta, University of Calgary"

Research enrolling over 3000 patients in three BC hospitals suggests that ADEs account for 12% of ED visits, causing over 200,000 ED visits in BC annually, incurring costs of roughly $90,000,000. Of these visits, 70% are preventable and most involve seniors. There are many reasons ADEs occur. New prescriptions are commonly issued in hospital and often filled before patients can consult their family physician. Medications that have previously caused harm are often re-dispensed because discontinuation orders are not communicated to PharmaNet (a medication billing system used across BC). Insufficient documentation in PharmaNet often results in unintentional prescribing and dispensing of contraindicated medications, as well as information gaps related to prescribing or patient monitoring for outpatient pharmacists or specialist physicians following up on patients. Conservative estimates suggest 1/3 of preventable ADEs are avoidable by designing new ADE reporting fields in PharmaNet to create a real-time, effective communication link between healthcare sectors. We estimate this platform will prevent over 40,000 ED visits and save $18,000,000 annually (using a cost base of $450/visit).Our project, Pill Talk, will implement and evaluate an ADE reporting platform through PharmaNet, which will integrate into various means of delivery of clinical care and address the need for improved communication of ADEs across locations of care and providers. Pill Talk builds on mature partnerships, extensive end user involvement and an existing prototype to implement and evaluate an enhanced PharmaNet-based ADE reporting platform in BC. The system will also meet emergent reporting requirements for recently passed Bill C-17.","Ellen Balka, Corinne M Hohl, Michael R Law, Stirling Bryan","Simon Fraser University, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia"
73,Improving social inclusion for Canadians with dementia and carers through sharing dance ( 2016/17-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/153408,"People with dementia and their carers experience barriers to meaningful social inclusion across a range of settings. Addressing these issues requires the development and evaluation of accessible, non-stigmatizing and affordable interventions that facilitate social inclusion in the home, communities and institutional settings across urban and rural Canada. A growing body of research suggests that arts-based health interventions can improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers; however, little is known about how these programs might address social inclusion specifically. The proposed research focuses on the potential of an innovative arts-based intervention, the National Ballet School of Canada's Sharing Dance for Seniors Program, to improve the social inclusion of people living with dementia and their carers. What is unique about the Sharing Dance Program is its emphasis on making dance accessible through in-person (live), on-line (live-streamed) and blended (in-person and live-streamed) dance outreach engagement sessions. The research will examine the experiences of people living with dementia and their carers participating in the program as well as assess the effectiveness of the multi-modal delivery of the program and the challenges of expanding and sustaining the program. The study will involve pilot studies of Sharing Dance for Seniors in Peterborough, Ontario and Brandon, Manitoba featuring in-depth observations and weekly diaries with program participants as well as focus groups and interviews with program participants, coordinators, instructors and volunteers. Ultimately, the research seeks to improve social inclusion for people with dementia and their carers where they live.","Verena H Menec, Rachel V Herron, Mark W Skinner, Pia C Kontos, Pia C Kontos","University of Manitoba, Brandon University, Trent University, University Health Network, University Health Network"
74,Improving social justice in observational studies ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231440,"Population and public health is concerned not just with overall health but also the distribution of health in the population. Observational studies are conducted in real-world settings. Thus, they are ideal to understand the distribution of health inequity and monitor changes in response to policies over time. Observational studies often do not report/analyze sufficient details related to social determinants of health, thus undermining their ability to inform decisions with implications for social justice. This project aims to develop a reporting guideline on health equity in observational studies using an evidence and consensus-driven integrated knowledge translation process. This will extend the well-known STROBE (STrengthening Reporting of Observational studies in Epidemiology) reporting guideline. The project is novel in co-producing knowledge with Indigenous people, people in low and middle income countries and socially excluded people with diverse stakeholders including patients/public, researchers and decision-makers. We will apply an equity and sex/gender lens throughout. Data will be collected on analysis and reporting of health equity and sex/gender in observational studies. Existing journal and funding guidance will be reviewed. We will use an online global survey to seek broad feedback. We will hold a consensus meeting with researchers, patients/public and knowledge users to draft a global reporting guideline on health equity in observational studies. We will assess the applicability of this guideline to Indigenous research in Canada using a parallel process and consensus meeting. We will develop, implement and evaluate an end of grant knowledge translation strategy which will include pragmatic tools for authors and journal editors. Trainees will co-lead studies with mentorship from senior coinvestigators.

75,Increasing safe mobility of older Canadian pedestrians and drivers ( 2016/17-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147843,"I will develop solutions to enable seniors to walk with less chance of falling and to drive safely. The ability to continue walking and driving safely is key to staying independent. Falls and accidents not only cause pain and cost but the resulting need for assistance with mobility creates a burden on family at home and may result in earlier admission to an institution. One component of my research will focus on opportunities to prevent falls by reducing environmental causes. We have provided evidence supporting changes to the Building Code of Canada to make stairs safer. That work will be extended to include standards for handrails on stairs, pathways and ramps as well as grab bars in bathrooms. In addition, many seniors are injured because of falls on ice. Fear of walking outside in winter causes many people to reduce their outings and their exercise. We will continue developing tests to guide consumers in the selection of safer footwear that will dramatically increase safety when walking on slippery surfaces. In parallel with walking research, I will focus on safer driving. One of the most devastating moments is being told that you can no longer drive safely and your keys are being taken away. As we grow older we need our cars more than ever because our walking is more limited, particularly in winter. Yet, our driving abilities may be challenged by vision or cognitive problems. It is neither safe nor practical to subject older people with, for example, dementia to challenging highway driving tests across all weather conditions. This research will focus on the ability to create realistic and valid driver testing using an advanced driving simulator. One of the main questions to be answered is whether such tests could be used to support a program of customized driving licenses. Such a program could limit driving for an individual, for example, to local streets in daylight where that person can be demonstrated to be safe rather than banning driving outright.",Geoffrey R Fernie,University Health Network

They identify what it means to ""age well"" and guide the development of communities that support seniors to do this; however, these frameworks have been critiqued for their Western perspective that does not take into account the experiences and perspectives of older adults from diverse non-Western cultural backgrounds, including Indigenous older adults. Using community-based participatory research, semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and Photovoice were conducted to explore aging well from the perspectives of Indigenous seniors in an urban community in Canada. The findings show how Indigenous older adults define aging well and explore some of the enablers and barriers to aging well, which can be used to further develop key frameworks related to aging and guide urban communities in supporting the aging Indigenous population.",Lauren A Brooks,University of Ottawa

Neither reflect the dominant attributes of the Canadian industry. By studying the automotive industry in countries with economic profiles similar to Canada, our research will address gaps in industrial policy and economic geography literature, and contribute to evidence-based policy decisions./strong&gt;A burgeoning literature in the social sciences and policy-related fields examines the role of government in supporting manufacturing. It emerged as a result of governments' renewed interest following the economic crisis of 2008-2009. While debate regarding the most effective policies persists, and although policy tools differ across jurisdictions, there is a consensus within this literature that they are necessary for countries seeking to grow or sustain manufacturing footprints.A recent body of research explores policy supports for the automotive manufacturing industry in Canada (Mordue and Sweeney, forthcoming; Sweeney and Mordue, 2017; Van Biesebroeck, 2010; Yates and Lewchuk, 2017). This research emphasizes the challenges that Canadian policy-makers face attracting and retaining automotive investment. A related body of work compares Canadian policy to other important automotive manufacturing jurisdictions, namely the US, Germany, and Mexico (Galvin and Goracinova, 2014; Goracinova et al., 2017). Yet unlike the US and Germany, Canada lacks a domestic automaker or a large domestic market, and unlike Mexico, Canada is a high-wage jurisdiction. While useful, the limitation is that it compares Canadian policies to those in jurisdictions with different profiles.This project will address existing shortcomings by comparing Canadian automotive policies with those employed by jurisdictions with profiles similar to Canada. Case studies will be conducted of the policy supports to support automotive manufacturing in three countries: Austria, Belgium and Spain. They are most similar to Canada's in that they: 1) are export-oriented, producing more vehicles than they consume; 2) lack a domestically-owned Original Equipment Manufacturer such as Ford, Toyota, or Volkswagen to anchor or drive investment; and 3) pay relatively high wages. Also, unlike the economies of the US, Germany, Japan, China or the UK, they do not represent leading economies in either a global or regional context.Each case study is based on qualitative and quantitative research. Researchers will first create detailed profiles of each country's automotive industry. They will be based on statistical data including production, employment, and trade. To gain a nuanced understanding, researchers will then conduct interviews with policy-makers and industry stakeholders. Once the case studies of each country are completed, they will be compared to Canada using an analytical framework adapted from the work of O'Sullivan et al. (2013). The project will produce three policy relevant outcomes. First, it will advance debates in the literature related to industrial policy supports for manufacturing. Second, it will modernize the literature in economic geography related to the role of individual countries and regions within the automotive industry's global production network (Sturgeon and Florida, 2000; Sturgeon and Van Biesebroeck, 2010; Pavlinek, 2016; Sweeney, 2016a; 2016b). Third, it will provide insight into options available to Canadian policy-makers whose role is to develop supports for the automotive manufacturing industry, and for manufacturing more generally.Anticipated outputs include manuscripts for international policy and economic geography journals, conference presentations, reports and presentations to policy-makers and industry stakeholders, and a panel presentation at the Automotive Policy Research Centre's international conference in 2018.The project will employ two MA level Research Assistants who will receive advanced training in policy analysis and industry profiling, and in translating research for industrial partners and policy-makers. They will also work with an External Advisory Committee consisting of senior automotive executives and policy makers. These opportunities will position them well for careers in these areas.","Greig Mordue, Brendan Sweeney","McMaster University, McMaster University"

From around age 3, children gradually learn how to pay attention to knowledge sources and how to determine the source of information. Our research focuses on the development of several thought processes known to be influenced by the development of the frontal lobe (the reasoning part of the brain) and critical to source monitoring. We expose children aged 3- to 14-years old to different sources of information and see how their memory, reasoning skills, judgment of source credibility, and ability to control their thoughts and attention affects the way they monitor the sources of information. It is important that children, and adults, are able to reflect on where they learned information so that we can edit out unreliable information from our knowledge base. As well as improving our understanding of the development of source monitoring, the research can also be used to answer basic research questions in many other areas, especially in an aging population. For example, Why does aging lead to deficits in source monitoring? Why do seniors often provide the same information to the same source? The current bombardment of sources of information is not likely to disappear soon. Thus, we must learn how to be intelligent and active consumers of information to protect the reliability of our knowledge.",Kim Roberts,Wilfrid Laurier University
79,Innovative healthcare for an older Canada: a public forum series on the science and policy of healthy aging ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/182292,"Concerns about the aging Canadian population and the needs to adapt to the growing and changing needs of the seniors are obviously much in the public discussions these days, as it can have wide ranging effects on social, economic and health systems. Increasingly many innovative approaches like artificial intelligence (AI) are being used to address the needs of the clients and the caregiver needs in the home and to decrease burden on the hospital or institutionalized care. However, this has not only raised various social and ethical concerns but also has opened more channels about accessing health-related misinformation. Through our next public forum series, we will be addressing the three topics: healthy aging, AI in health, and learning about your health in the age of misinformation. Drawing on the success of our previous public forums, Science & Policy Exchange proposes to organize a public forum series in 2018-2019 to disseminate current research and policy issues surrounding health in the context of current aging population in Canada, the impact of artificial intelligence and disruptive technologies in health, as well as on the causes and possible solutions to address the viral spread of misinformation about public health. These forums are a platform for the public to engage with experts in this field, to not only increase their knowledge on these topics but also to ask their burning questions and inform the experts on the public's concerns. In the long-term, we hope these forums empower the public to take an informed decision or stance when faced with medical issues and to be conscious of potential misinformation. Science & Policy Exchange (SPE) is a non-profit group run by graduate students and post-doctoral fellows in Montreal, whose mission is to foster the student voice in policy making and to bring together leading experts from academia, industry, and government to engage and inform students and the public on issues at the interface of science and policy.",NEHA Bhutani,McGill University
80,International Indigenous Mentorship Workshop in New Zealand ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/216101,"I am an Indigenous (Mi'kmaw), Early Career Researcher, having finished my PhD in Policy Studies at Ryerson University in April 2019. However, I have been appointed an Assistant Professor & Special Advisor to the Dean of Indigenous Resurgence at York University since August 2018. Since starting this position, I have started to put together a community based and led research programme, including applying for two CIHR research funding: the Indigenous Gender & Wellness funding announcement and a Catalyst Grant for HIV/AIDS in Indigenous Communities. All of my research is community-based and led using Indigenous ways of knowing and being, including Indigenous and arts-based methods. However, I have never led, aside from my doctoral research, a research programme. This mentorship workshop will allow me the opportunity to gain useful skills to succeed in conducting good research with and alongside my communities and partners. Additionally, I hope to gain skills which will allow me conduct research which is not only fully community based but can also be recognized within the Western modes of the academy. Up until this point in my career, I have had few Indigenous mentors, aside from my doctoral supervisor, therefore an opportunity to attend this workshop will assist me in being able to expand my network of senior Indigenous researchers who I can connect with to seek guidance as I start my work. I would note that I am the only Indigenous faculty member in the Faculty of Health at York University, so the need to have strong guidance and mentorship not only in research but how to work in a Western academy, cannot be understated.",Sean A Hillier,York University
82,"Investigating, connection, communication and temporality in conversations on death and dying using a design research approach ( 2017/18-2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112472,"The LivingHOPE Project will explore themes of technology use, connection, communication, and temporality, in the dying process. As seniors make up Canada's fastest growing age group, Canadians will increasingly need to confront the experience of end of life. While death and dying includes conversations on the concerns of healthcare providers about medical care, a more comprehensive conversation about end-of-life encompasses discussions on a broader range of topics, including family dynamics, interpersonal relationships, life experiences, spiritual values and personal beliefs and preferences. Technology for communication may play a role in these discussions, and its use may come and go as the situation around decline and dying changes pace. While technology can be a connector for family at a distance its role when the pace of declinechanges is not well understood. Current ideas about how to facilitate end of life experiences tend to ignore family at a distance and assume a level of technology use that remains the same through to death and in grieving. This project will involve bringing families, support groups, caregivers, as wellas healthcare providers, together to better understand the use of communication technology in connecting family in a range of temporal situations at end-of-life. The project has four specific objectives:1) To develop and adapt art and design techniques for engaging in research on the topic of death and dying.2) To understand how communication technologies are used during decline and death - especially for families at a distance.3) To develop an example artifact that is based on the outcomes of our research so that it can be used to stimulate dialogue on new ways to understand connection and temporal aspects of death and dying.",Katherine Sellen,OCAD University
83,It takes two to tango: a couples approach to goal regulation in old age ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109853,"Canada is experiencing a period of unprecedented socio-demographic change. Over the next ten years, the proportion of older adults is expected to double, making it essential to better understand how older adults may be able to continue pursuing valued goals and lead a meaningful life until late in life. To date, most aging research focuses on the individual. Yet, we, and others, have shown that key indicators of successful aging such as social engagement, well-being, and cognitive functioning are closely interrelated in couples. Embracing a social contextual perspective on aging, the proposed research extends previous aging models to couples to better understand the mechanisms that help older partners accomplish together what may not be possible alone. Goal-based aging models emphasize the need to distinguish between two qualitatively distinct processes that contribute to successful aging: engaging in the pursuit of valued goals and adjusting unattainable ones. These processes involve several different components: (a) selectively attending to goal-relevant information, (b) appraising a situation based on goals, (c) modifying behaviors to overcome problems with goal pursuit, and (d) disengaging from unfeasible goals. In extending this individual-focused model to couples, the proposed research aims to shed light on how older partners may be able to promote goal regulation across all four model components. Specifically, we distinguish between two ways in which partners may promote goal regulation in old age: (a) by creating a social context that strengthens individual resources, thereby allowing older adults to perform at their best (optimization) and (b) by directly getting involved when optimization does not suffice (compensation). We expect that partner self-validation is a particularly important mechanism that helps older adults optimize goal regulation. We further propose that partner collaborations are an effective means to compensate for age-normative resource limitations when optimization does not suffice. The proposed study uses an innovative combination and integration of experimental paradigms and repeated daily life assessments ('time-sampling') to address these research questions within the same sample. Specifically, 100 older couples will complete an experimental module on partner optimization, an experimental module on partner compensation, and ten days of simultaneous repeated daily life assessments from both spouses ('time-sampling') using a senior friendly iPad mini app. This approach will allow us to pinpoint the proposed causal mechanisms underlying partner optimization and compensation in goal regulation under controlled laboratory conditions. Combining lab and life will further help to examine the ecological validity of experimental findings, study the daily life dynamics underlying spousal goal regulation, and link them with time-varying indicators of well-being. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide a deeper, more complete understanding of the ways in which older partners can help each other to accomplish together what might be difficult to realize alone. Consequently, findings will lead to an advancement of knowledge from a scientific point of view. They will also benefit stakeholders and community organizations by guiding educational interventions that capitalize on the role of partners for promoting successful aging at a historical point in time when the large Baby Boomer cohort is entering retirement age. Finally, this research will also contribute to student training and help launch the next generation of aging scholars and knowledge mobilization agents.","Christiane Hoppmann, Carsten Wrosch, None None","University of British Columbia, Concordia University, Concordia University"
84,Joe Clark: a political biography ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109761,"Joe Clark was Canada's sixteenth Prime Minister. Defeating Pierre Trudeau's Liberals in the 1979 election, his Progressive Conservative minority government lasted less than a year before it fell on a budget vote, and then was defeated in the February 1980 election. It would have been understandable had Clark withdrawn from public life, relegated to a footnote in Canadian political history. But this did not happen. Clark went on to serve as Leader of the Opposition, as a senior Cabinet Minister, and then again as party leader from 1998-2003. Thirty-six years after his ""defeat"", Clark is now highly regarded as an elder statesman, well known for his advocacy of Canadian engagement in the world and international development, and able to pack the room for his public lectures. Joe Clark has had a fascinating career, and it is surprising that he has not yet been the subject of a political biography. A biography of Clark will permit the exploration of a number of key issues in Canadian political and social life, and also effectively be the writing of a political history of Canada and of Canada's conservative movements in the latter third of the twentieth century. This research will be of keen interest not only to historians and political scientists, but also to politicians and policy makers and the wider Canadian general public, who routinely take an active interest in how past leaders of our country have shaped it. Although not always holding the levers of power, Clark was a key actor in several key political debates, both domestic and international. In international relations, his career touched the Vietnamese boat people refugee question, the Iran hostage crisis, South African apartheid, free trade, Canada's role at the end of the Cold War, and the first Iraq war. A Red Tory who believed the state had a role to play in social programs, but was cautious about excessive government involvement in the economy, he attempted to shift Canadian policies on energy and nationalization during the peak years of the 1970s-80s energy crisis. A Western Canadian who thought that Canada was better served by a vision of the country as a ""community of communities"" than a single, centralized identity, he championed this decentralized approach to federalism through the constitutional reform rounds from the 1970s to the 1990s, and was key to including First Nations leaders in the Charlottetown Accord negotiations. The manner in which he engaged in politics, led his party, and participated in the democratic process will reveal many key developments in Canadian political life. Clark's political career is particularly important as a tool to understanding the evolution of Canadian conservative politics. A key figure in the ""Red Tory"" wing of socially-moderate Conservatives, Clark fiercely resisted the rise of the Reform Party/Canadian Alliance approach that melded social conservatism with neo-liberal policies that would dismantle the welfare state. He was a fervent ""Progressive"" Conservative, who returned to politics and played a key role in the tumult of the early-2000s, including the briefly-lived Democratic Representative Coalition. It is a story that will also shed light on changing social dynamics in Canada, especially through Clark's relationship with his wife Maureen McTeer, a high-profile career woman, a full partner in his political decision-making process, an abortion rights activist, and the only wife of a Prime Minister to fully keep her own name. Clark's socially progressive conservatism allowed for celebrating diversity, a point made clearly when he was Grand Marshall of Calgary's Gay Pride parade. In all, his is a compelling and important story in Canada's political history that shaped the country, and needs to be told.",Matthew Hayday,University of Guelph
85,Joint Design of Priority Rules and Service Capacity in Multi-class Queues and Applications in Public Sectors ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/202219,"In many public sectors, the system manager has to ration the limited resources or service capacity among candidates with heterogeneous attributes. Given the scarcity of public resources (service capacity), candidates have to experience long wait before receiving the resource (service). The system manger strives to design a priority rule that maximizes the total matching utility that depends on both the candidate and resource types; meanwhile, she may have other objectives to achieve. For example, in many public systems, it is desirable to maintain equitable waiting times across different candidate types. We will study the following service systems. All of them can be modeled a multi-class queue equipped with a certain priority rule, but each has its specialty that makes the underlying mathematical model non-trivial to analyze.******1.Deceased-Donor Kidney Waitlist ***Since 2008, the Canadian governments have been actively looking for recommendations for an allocation system which improves transplantation outcomes as well as provide equitable access to patients on the organ waitlist. What makes the policy design problem challenging is that patients may reject a low-quality kidney offer in order to wait for high-quality organs. Therefore, the policy designer's problem is to search for an allocation policy, which leads to a Nash equilibrium with the most desired performance. ******2.Emergency Departments (ED)***EDs typically use a triage system to classify patients into priority levels. However, the actual routing decision mostly depends on the ED physician's individual decision. By analyzing the ED physicians' historical decision pattern, we developed a model to predict how patients are routed in EDs. This prediction model allows us to optimize the physician's shift schedule as well as to forecast the waiting time, which is released to patients on the websites.******3.Public Affordable Housing Allocation***Canada and the U.S. provide affordable housing options for eligible low-income families, seniors, disabled, etc. For example, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) supports nearly 600,000 households annually. The housing applicants need to specify their order of preference among different housing types. We study the best ranking mechanism which encourages house applicants to truthful report their preference and meanwhile achieves the best allocation outcome.******4. Management of Follow-up appointments in Primary Care***To maintain continuity of care, a usual practice for family physician is to reserve slots for the follow-up visits to ensure that those patients receive care within the required time window. However, reserving a slot in advance is associated with a higher no-show rate, which is supported by our empirical findings. We investigate the optimal prioritization rule for the follow-up visits to minimize balkings and no-shows. *****",Yichuan Ding,University of British Columbia

87,Knowledge synthesis for mechanistic and targeted in-person and digital social-connection intervention for wellness and resilience in older adults in pandemic context and beyond ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231757,"Extended periods of social isolation and loneliness can have a negative impact on individual physical and mental well-being. This problem is particularly troubling for older adults as loneliness and isolation are risk factors for depression, heart disease, and premature death. Because they are also at greater risk of complications from COVID-19 infections, seniors have been especially targeted by social and physical distancing measures, further limiting their social interactions. In a post-lockdown world where social restrictions are likely to last for vulnerable aging populations, it is important to find the appropriate balance between physical distancing and social connection (be it in-person, digital, or a combination of both) to promote older adults' long term well-being and resilience. This project aims to answer the following questions: Among older adults, who are the most vulnerable to the mental health effects of social isolation? What strategies are the most likely to succeed in preventing or mitigating the effects of social isolation? To this end, we will review the most recent scientific evidence and share our findings with 'knowledge users' such as healthcare professionals, policymakers, and patient groups. Building upon these findings, we will be able to simulate different interventions using a digital platform known as SynthEco. This platform will assist decision-makers in evaluating the potential benefits and harms of the in-person and digital interventions identified by our project.","Laurette Dubé, Robert N Spreng, Miguel Cisneros-Franco, Gillian Bartlett-Esquilant, Catherine Paquet","McGill University, Montreal Neurological Institute, McGill University, McGill University, Laval University"
91,Language Regimes in Theory and Practice ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184034,"The international workshop titled ""Language Regimes in Theory and Practice"" will be held at the University of Ottawa, on 10 and 11 May 2019. It will bring together some of the best and most innovative researchers working on language policies internationally. Researchers invited are from Aruba, Canada, Peru, Poland, Norway, Scotland, Switzerland, the United States and Wales. The overarching goal of the international workshop is to advance knowledge on language regimes, i.e. the large set of institutionalized practices and representations regarding languages and language use in a range of sectors and domains (e.g. in education, health care, immigration, employment, public administration or the delivery of public services, as well as discursive interventions). As societies become more and more multilingual and multicultural, how do we explain the language policy choices made by states? How are states reacting to the linguistic demands of their populations, whether local, indigenous or recently arrived populations? What are the policy tools used by international organisations to attend to the needs of linguistic minorities, in particular during peace processes or in post-conflict situations? What are the theoretical and methodological tools needed for the study of language policies? This is a sample of the questions that will be addressed during the international workshop. Furthermore, the workshop builds on discussions and debates generated at recent conferences and in other forums following the publication of State Traditions and Language Regimes (STLR) by Cardinal and Sonntag (MQUP, 2015). This work established the foundations of a neo-institutional approach to the study of how and why states make certain language policy choices and avoid others. Over the past two years, several papers at two key conferences -- the 2016 International Association of Political Science World Congress in Poznan, Poland and a major international conference on the politics of multilingualism in Amsterdam in May 2017-- have engaged with and built on STLR's general framework and questions asked about the study of language policy choices. These papers revealed that more research and reflection was needed to expand and refine the theory and methods introduced in STLR. The aims of this international workshop is to push forward this research agenda and propose case studies on a diverse range of language regimes from different continents. These case studies address issues relevant to the theory but also the practice of language regimes. The workshop will bring together 23 recruited scholars, including doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, junior and senior professors. The workshop format will promote and foster in-depth discussions and engagement between top scholars working on language regimes and language policies. It will consist of five sessions that will address the following themes: - Analytical and methodological tools for the study of language regimes - Territorial governance and language regimes - The normative dimension in the study of language regime - Colonial and postcolonial state traditions - Multilevel governance, international and supranational language regimes It is expected that one major book publication will result from the international workshop. In addition, we will use Facebook live during the workshop to help disseminate and provide other colleagues, students, policy-makers and the general public vignettes of the work of our colleagues to better introduce the latest research in the area of language policy and explain the importance of their work for improving language planning.","Linda Cardinal, Rémi Léger","University of Ottawa, Simon Fraser University"
93,Learning From the Lived Experiences of Aging Immigrants ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184058,"This SSHRC Connections project extends on an Insight Development Grant undertaken between 2014 and 2017 titled 'Intersectional identities and interlocking oppressions: Stories of the everyday among ethnocultural minority older adults (EMOA) in Canada'. The project, led by Drs. Shari Brotman (McGill University) and Sharon Koehn (Simon Fraser University) collected in-depth life stories and photographs from 19 diverse older immigrants in British Columbia and Quebec. The resultant narrative photovoice exhibit summarized each participant's story and extracted 6 dominant themes: Housing & Transportation, Traumas of the Past, Precarious Employment, Community Engagement, Family & Care, and Agency & Resilience. The stories and photographs in the exhibit provided insight into the complex ways in which structural discrimination across the life course, particularly associated with immigration, shapes older adults' interactions with family, community, and formal services. These stories highlighted how policies and services need to be more supportive, flexible, and accessible to better represent the lives of older immigrants from diverse communities. A key outcome of the project was the identification of the need to encourage knowledge exchange with service providers and policymakers in order to identify solutions across sectors. The exhibit provides a springboard for our current research proposal, which centres on knowledge mobilization and facilitated outreach activities aimed at identifying how health and social service providers, community groups and policy makers can implement or influence changes within their spheres of engagement to support the social inclusion and well-being of immigrant older adults. SSHRC Connection Grant funds will be used to present the 'Lived Experiences of Aging Immigrants' photo exhibit and facilitate discussions with key stakeholders who are capable of making or influencing changes at the levels of policy, practice, and community that can positively influence the design and delivery of services to immigrant older adults. Our knowledge mobilization and outreach program brings together academic researchers and community-based organizations in four cities across Canada (Montreal, Quebec City, Calgary, and Vancouver) who will work together to undertake 9 Outreach Forums along three key theme areas to be held over the course of one year. The theme areas are connected to significant findings from our photo exhibit related to (1) Caregiving, Family and Home Care; (2) Housing and Transportation, and (3) Social Inclusion & Community Engagement. As part of each Outreach Forum, the narrative-photovoice exhibit will be mounted in locations convenient to invited stakeholders and will be used as a springboard for facilitated discussions in which stakeholders will be encouraged to identify and prioritize actions to effect change within their spheres of influence. For example, these groups will include senior peer support volunteers, population/community health specialists charged with delivering health promotion programs, regional and municipal policy advisors, and seniors' rights advocates. The discussions will encourage participants to take ownership of the initiatives they recommend. Collaborators identified in each city will facilitate engagement with relevant groups. A final report and summary policy briefs directed at specific audiences will be generated. The potential contribution this project can have on our various target audiences (i.e. academia, community groups, service providers and older people) is significant particularly given the current lack of information on the realities of aging immigrants. Our project supports the development and uptake of new knowledge and best practices across sectors.","Émilie Raymond, Shari L Brotman, Ilyan Ferrer, Pam Orzeck, Sharon D Koehn","Laval University, McGill University, University of Calgary, McGill University, Simon Fraser University"
94,Learning and Problem Space in Innovation Project Teams ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112550,"Research increasingly emphasizes the role of teams in generating innovation and stimulating organizations' performance, but case studies often reveal how difficult teaming up for innovation can be in practice. Team scholars have explored what factors matter for teams to achieve high performance. Yet, two important facets of teamwork have yet to be resolved within the literature. First, team learning has been at the center of a number of these studies, but conflicting results warrant further examination. For example, teams can learn when their members interact externally with parties in their environment, and they can also learn internally when their members interact with one another. However, while the two activities are deemed complementary, external learning and internal learning have mostly been studied separately. Moreover, the few studies that include both activities have produced conflicting results regarding the relationship between internal and external learning for team performance, suggesting that further investigation into the mechanism of how these two types of learning produce greater team performance is necessary. Second, a context-free approach prevails in team research. Internal, team-level factors (i.e. inputs such as team composition or processes such as team learning) have been the focus of much scientific inquiry, while higher-level contextual features have been largely overlooked. Yet, the setting in which a team works, such as that created by the various constraints it faces, can have an important influence on team-level factors and team performance. Additionally, the few recent studies that consider the effect of time or resource constraints on teamwork have produced mixed results.With this project, we aim to address these two issues found in the team literature to provide much needed theoretical and practical insights. We intend to develop a new scale that will measure team problem space, an extensive set of constraints that may influence teams' processes and ability to perform. Taking advantage of a research setting that involves over 1,100 teams of three to seven people participating in an innovation contest at a Global 500 company, we propose to use this new scale with well-established measures of external and internal learning in a survey-based, time-lagged research design. In addition to the performance measures that are collected by the contest's organizers, we plan to collect additional outcomes such as efficiency and innovation team performance data from senior-level managers. Altogether, these data will allow us to test a theoretical model that will help address the team-learning puzzle while considering the context in which teams operate. The results of our analysis will serve as a first step into building a contingency framework that can serve as a tool for managers and practitioners involved in innovation projects to identify the team-learning processes that are needed for particular types of team problem spaces.We believe this project has the potential to make significant contributions both in terms of the advancement knowledge and delivering wider social benefit. First, while the conceptual development of team problem space and the survey-based study will make timely contributions to the team literature, the new scale will equip future research for years on end. Second, students involved in this project will learn about a wide arrays of domains (e.g., scale development, qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis, and knowledge mobilization for various audiences) in addition to having the opportunity to considerably develop their professional network. Finally, the knowledge produced in this project will be actionable and particularly relevant to practice. Since all organizations increasingly rely on teams to pursue innovation and realize their mission, it will be tremendously valuable for managers and practitioners to understand how certain constraints act differently and are interpreted differently in ways that impact team learning and team performance for better or worse.","Jean-Francois Harvey, Amy Edmondson, Amy Edmondson","HEC Montréal, Harvard University, Harvard University"
95,"Lipid metabolism, insulin secretion and energy homeostasis ( 2015/16-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147782,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are multi-factorial diseases encompassing dysfunctions of pancreatic islet, liver and adipose tissues, insulin resistance and cardiometabolic complications. Current therapies for T2D and obesity address one aspect of the disease at a time, which often leads to long-term failure of these approaches. It is desirable to find target(s) allowing simultaneous correction of these multiple derangements by a single therapeutic intervention.In our studies on glycerolipid/ fatty acid (GL/FA) cycle, a key pathway balancing glucose and lipid metabolism, we discovered that GL/FA cycle-derived monoacylglycerol (MAG) is involved in insulin secretion and action, adipose browning and energy expenditure, and the regulation of appetite and locomotor activity. We also found that signaling-competent MAG levels are regulated by (greek small letter alpha)/ß-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) that degrades this metabolite to glycerol and fatty acids. In addition, we recently discovered a novel metabolic enzyme in mammalian cells, glycerol-3-phosphate (Gro3P) phosphatase (G3PP), which controls cellular levels of Gro3P, a metabolite that lies at the intersection of glucose and glycerolipid metabolism. Our supporting data reveal that G3PP indeed regulates glucose and fatty acid metabolism at large and many physiological functions. The evidence also indicates that inhibition of ABHD6 or activation of G3PP has anti-diabetic and obesity effects.The overall goals of this proposal are to:-Define the role of two novel GL/FA cycle enzymes, ABHD6 and G3PP, in the regulation of insulin secretion and action, the control of adipose browning and energy homeostasis;-Identify novel targets and functions of MAG as a second messenger;-Harness this knowledge for the prevention and treatment of T2D and obesity.The anticipated findings will:-Emphasize the importance of GL/FA cycle and the new enzymes that control the exit (ABHD6) and entry (G3PP) of metabolites into the cycle in the overall regulation of energy homeostasis, fuel metabolism and detoxification.-Delineate how these enzymes are regulated and control various biological functions.-Address the question if ABHD6 can fulfill the role of a “single” target that can result in beneficial therapeutic effects against obesity, T2D, and ß-cell dysfunction.-Identify G3PP as a novel target, whose activation can be beneficial for metabolic derangements in different tissues in the context of fuel surfeit.The healthcare relevant impact and outcome will be to identify ABHD6 inhibitors and G3PP activators and to test their therapeutic efficacy for obesity, T2D and cardiovascular diseases, in collaboration with industrial partners.The proposed work calls for significant experience in metabolic and molecular studies, both in vitro and in vivo, that are accessible in the laboratory. This program will be undertaken by the PI and a team of senior investigators with years of experience in metabolic diseases, molecular & cell biology and drug discovery & development; collaborating experts in relevant fields; and well trained post docs, students and technicians. The trainees will be exposed to various aspects of translational research from mechanistic studies to drug discovery and development, which will provide them with a greater insight of medical research.",Marc Prentki,University of Montreal
96,Literacy and self-regulation development in play-based kindergarten classrooms: a comparison of pedagogical approaches ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113032,"While there is general agreement that play is beneficial to children's learning and development, there is conflicting information concerning the implementation of play in kindergarten classrooms. One body of research espouses the developmental benefits of play, including play's role in the development of self-regulation. This research describes the importance of child directed free play with minimal teacher involvement. Conversely, a second body of research describes the potential academic benefits of play, including the development of foundational literacy skills. This research demonstrates the essential role of the teacher in play to support the integration of play and academic learning. These contradictory findings present a dilemma for kindergarten teachers who must negotiate a balance between the mandated academic standards communicated by the curriculum and the mandated developmentally appropriate use of play-based learning. The proposed research aims to bridge these diverse views by: 1. Exploring variations in the implementation of play-based pedagogies in kindergarten classrooms; 2. Determining the impact of varying implementations on the development of academic (i.e., literacy) and developmental (i.e., self-regulation) skills; 3. Providing an empirical foundation for bridging the academic-developmental rift in the literature. To accomplish these goals, we will expand on our prior research, which found that teachers adopt one of two play profiles: (1) the implementation of free play with no teacher involvement, supplemented by teacher directed instruction in academic skills such as literacy; (2) the implementation of free and more teacher directed types of play, where literacy instruction is embedded in play contexts. Using these two play profiles as the foundation, this study will identify the play-based profiles of kindergarten classrooms with a specific focus on: a) the ways children's literacy skills are supported within the classrooms and b) the ways teachers enable children's opportunities to demonstrate self-regulation (e.g., variations in provision of free play). The sample will include 270 junior and senior kindergarten students recruited from 45 kindergarten classrooms in Ontario over a three-year period. Classroom play profile characteristics will be drawn from video analysis (3 hours of video per class at fall and spring) and from teacher interviews including their responses to a novel Q-sort task designed to capture teachers' beliefs regarding play-based learning in relation to literacy and self-regulation. Data will also be collected from participating students in the fall and spring of the year. Both objective and informant based measures of emotional and behavioral self-regulation will be collected along with objective indicators of key emergent literacy skills (e.g., oral vocabulary knowledge, phonological awareness). Key covariates and potential moderators of student change over time will also be collected (i.e., nonverbal intellectual ability, socioeconomic status, and language status (e.g., English language learner). The proposed study will address key questions important to practice and policy and will enhance our understanding of how children can best be supported across both developmental and academic areas of learning through play-based pedagogy. Furthermore, this study will contribute to the broader debate regarding the appropriateness of play-based learning for supporting developmental growth as well as achieving mandated academic skills.","Angela D Pyle, Rhonda L Martinussen","University of Toronto, University of Toronto"
97,Managing sustainable cross sector social partnerships in action ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187371,"In an effort to come to grips with intricate social issues such as doping in sport or climate change, a relatively new form of organization has emerged - cross sector social partnerships. These are organizations that bring together corporations, not for profits and/or governments and move beyond the traditional strategic alliance between corporations as they collectively seek to address major multifaceted social issues. Firms often turn to nonprofits and government agencies to diversify their competitive advantage and to meet their broader obligations to society. Indeed, it is currently ""difficult to find an important company or nonprofit that is not engaged in cross-sector collaboration"" (Austin & Seitanidi, 2014). Yet, a recent literature review of strategic alliances' success factors demonstrates that most academic literature on strategic alliances largely focuses on alliances between firms (Russo & Cesarani, 2017) and, by and large, ignores cross sector social partnerships. Consequently, the question of what contributes to the success of complex cross sector social partnerships remains largely unanswered. Yet, when one considers the required investments in time and resources to set up and manage cross sector social partnerships, it is clearly important to better understand the success factors of these specific types of strategic alliances. Put differently, the need for insights on the factors that generate mutual benefits and value for each ally, as well as how to manage these factors, are significant. Special Olympics Canada is one nonprofit that has benefited from longstanding partnerships with several large firms. However, Special Olympics still seeks to refine its understanding of the motivations of initial partners as well as what drives long term partnerships. Building on Dr. Webb's previous research with Special Olympics, this project will mobilize both senior management at Special Olympics, as well as with their funding partners, to collectively reflect upon the factors that contribute to the long lasting and sustainable cross sector social partnerships. Through open and frank discussions, one on one interviews, and round-table discussions at their annual strategic planning session, this research partnership proposal will allow for in-depth reflection and discussions about why partners choose to support Special Olympics Canada in the first place, and then what makes them stick around. This research collaboration will provide insight on the action of recruiting, activating, and retaining partners, from the point of view of the funding partners' themselves. This is indeed an important question for all actors involved in any cross sector social partnership. Yet, as Special Olympics have been working for over 50 years now to enrich the lives, through sport, of people living with an intellectual disability, their ability to build lasting relationships offers an exciting potential for identifying best practices that could benefit other cross-sector social partnerships.",Andrew Webb,Carleton University
102,Neuro-muscular innervation in neonatal intestinal development ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/2309,"We look at the development of the neuromuscular layer of the newborn mammalian intestine, which will lengthen many-fold before reaching its adult size. This involves extensive growth of the smooth muscle cells to create the adult form. However, the neurons of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which are all present at birth, must coordinate with this and develop the adult pattern of innervation, as the ENS will eventually regulate the timely contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle that allows normal digestion. Our goal is to understand how neurons at birth stay alive and adapt to the rapid growth of their target cells, creating the complex, stable relationship seen in the adult . Current support showed us that a single factor (GDNF; a neurotrophin) is responsible for survival of the ENS neurons after birth, and that GDNF is made by the intestinal smooth muscle cells. Critically, growth of these cells is required for increased GDNF expression that leads to neuron survival and axon outgrowth. We propose that the binding of GDNF to its receptor, RET, causes two outcomes: initially , survival and then axonal extension, and it may be that different levels of GDNF are required for each. We have the cellular and molecular techniques needed to address this, and a unique tissue culture model involving both neonatal intestinal neurons and smooth muscle cells. We will separate the outcomes of GDNF signalling with pharmacological inhibitors that block distinct pathways in the neurons (the only cells expressing GDNF receptors) , and then measure cellular outcomes of survival or the degree of axonal outgrowth. We will then examine the requirements of neurons for GDNF when growth is complete – do very low levels maintain survival? How is this signalling achieved? Axonal outgrowth seems absent in the adult intestine, but when it arises to facilitate repair, the neurons do not function well, and this is seen elsewhere with nerve damage. We now think that axon outgrowth and nerve function in the neonatal ENS (ie, action potentials and neurotransmitter release) tend not to occur at the same time. Therefore, the structural programme becomes complete as the functional programme gains ascendancy, with synthesis, storage and release of neurotransmitters. Quantitative measurement of the steps involved, such as mRNA and protein, will measure key proteins that belong in either one of these programmes, and this will be correlated with the ability of the neurons to display mature signalling properties. This will help us to understand how the intestine develops in the neonate, a field where little is known. I will work with trainees, who will mainly be graduate students as well as senior undergraduates. They will gain both technical expertise as well as education in scientific thinking and critical evaluation. To date, our graduates are highly successful, with significant publications in this field, and very good career achievements.",Michael Blennerhassett,Queen's University
103,Next-Generation Decision-Support Tool for Urban Transportation Planning: Accommodating on-Demand Mobility and Automated/Connected Automated Vehicle Systems ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/209903,"***The upcoming transport revolutiondriven by internet/smartphone-based on-demand services and automated vehicle (AV) technologieswill completely change the way we plan, maintain and operate urban transportation infrastructures. Yet, we have neither a comprehensive understanding of the impacts of these technologies on urban transportation systems nor an appropriate decision-support tool to help develop the public policies necessary for sustainable systems. ******AV systems will affect travel behaviour, presenting new choices while possibly eliminating old ones. The demand for private cars may increase, particularly among those incapable of driving, e.g. children, seniors. This can improve mobility and social inclusion but at the cost of greater reliance on the automobile and, perhaps, the demise of current forms of urban transit. However, today's best transportation demand models cannot make reliable predictions. They use household travel surveys for data. Such surveys collect data that are of current/existing contexts of urban form and transportation technologies, and so the mathematical specifications of these models are based on the demand-supply interactions of conventional transportation systems. Current contexts of urban form, transportation systems and demand-supply interactions may not remain valid for the future with widespread applications of AV, on-demand mobility services and our changed demands for transportation. So, there is a dire need of updating the current state-of-the art of travel demand models (a decision-support system for urban transportation) and this is envisioned in this project. The next-generation decision-support system to be developed in this project will be based on consumer behaviour-based travel choice models and on accurate travel demand data collected through designed experiments (of impacts of AV and on-demand mobility). These models can predict latent/suppressed demands for using urban transportation systems as the latter evolve due to increasing automation and a coordinated/connected approach to operations. ******I have extensive experience in travel survey methods, data fusion and travel demand modelling as well as in training students, who are in high demand at public, non-profit and for-profit organizations in urban transportation. The project will train 18 students on transportation planning, travel demand modelling, travel survey methods, statistical analysis and software development. The tool (decision-support system) will break new ground on evidence-based transportation planning and policy development while recognizing future uncertainty. It will help urban planners, transportation planners, traffic engineer, and public policy-makers develop transportation and land-use policies for the impending era with accurate data on the urban economy, environmental sustainability and social equity.**",Khandker NurulHabib,University of Toronto
104,Non-Covalent Immobilization Methods for Homogeneous Organic Catalysts ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/195234,"Catalytic reactions provide green, efficient, and selective syntheses of organic compounds when compared to waste-generating stoichiometric methods. However, many catalytic transformations are homogeneous and transition metal based. Metal impurities often remain in the desired compound after isolation and purification. Although selective homogeneous organocatalysts can be used, their activities and stabilities are often low, and their handling too demanding for economically viable industrial applications. The application and design of highly active heterogeneous organic catalysts has broad impacts in fine chemical and active pharmaceutical synthesis, yet to-date very few have made it to industrial practice due to limited reactivity and scope. Over the next five years the MacQuarrie group will implement an innovative method of supporting an array of chiral organic catalysts with enhanced homogeneous properties via charge matching between the ionically bound catalyst and the charged supports. The catalyst will not be rigidly bound to the surface enhancing reactivity and availability to reagents and stereocontrol will be improved over homogeneous analogues do to the confined environments the catalysts are placed in. The materials will be prepared in as inexpensive and green a manner as possible and the supports will range from highly ordered silicas to renewable resources such as biochar. Herein, we will take advantage of the charged nature of biochar (through its retained oxygen based functional groups) to enable facile heterogenization of several classes of organocatalysts. The proposed research program will be completed primarily with BSc students, however graduate students are included via adjunct status, to diversify the group and promote BSc students to consider graduate school. All students are trained for independent operation of on-site equipment, and senior BSc students, technicians, and postdoctoral researchers are paired with the BSc students on the projects, providing laboratory supervision. MacQuarrie has a well-established industrial collaboration with BioEnergy Inc. and the Lousibourg Seafoods Inc., both of which have provided in-kind funding for a postdoctoral researcher which is of paramount importance, providing consistency in research and facilitating student supervision, but their projects are fairly limited to industrially relevant work.","Stephanie MacQuarrie, Stephanie Macquarrie","Cape Breton University, Cape Breton University"
105,Nonlinear Wave Resonances in Bounded Media ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/207769,"Resonances are a fundamental aspect of physical phenomena in settings ranging from fluid mechanics to acoustics to optics. They are generally characterized by a constructive interaction between external forcing and natural internal frequencies. In some cases (such as lasers, and musical instruments) such effects are desired, and in other cases (such as fluid transport and engine design) they are not. While the immediate mechanism is well understood, the long term effects of these interactions can be quite varied and depend on a multitude of factors. ******Driven by a range of applications, a robust literature has emerged over recent decades to model and mathematically investigate resonant phenomena. With new analytic tools has come new insights and refinements which in turn has driven demand for further detail from the underlying models and techniques of analysis. This positive feedback loop has provided fruitful insights for both application and analysis and it has lead to the development of an array of techniques. However while these provide insights and solution descriptions for the applications at hand, they can miss underlying mathematical connections. ******This proposal is divided into two main themes. The first theme is dedicated to the development of analytic methodologies which are based on the underlying mathematical structure and as such potentially tie together disparate regimes. Specifically the focus will be on the transition between cases where the higher harmonics are themselves resonant, to cases where they are not. In the case of acoustic waves this can correspond to, for example, slight variations in geometry of the resonator itself. ******In conjunction with this, the second theme of this proposal ties together two two prior bodies of work under the auspices of two previous NSERC Discovery Grants. It is focused on the application of these methodologies in both dispersive (e.g sloshing of a shallow fluid) and non-dispersive contexts (e.g. gas in a resonant cavity). In so doing potentially powerful connections between seemingly disparate physical regimes, and corresponding insights, will be made. In particular, questions related to the resonant response of a gas in a tube in the finite rate regime, as well as the impact of temporal modulation in the forcing will be addressed. ******The impacts of this work will lie both in the development of mathematical tools for analysis of resonant phenomena across a broad range of applications, as well as for the applications themselves. Both the dispersive and non-dispersive aspects will involve a blend of modelling, analysis and numerical simulation. They will afford and necessitate abundant opportunity for student involvement ranging from senior undergraduate to doctoral and postdoctoral levels. They will also not only provide fundamental insights into the underlying resonant mechanisms and outcomes, but also the opportunity for direct application in an array of industrial settings.**",David Amundsen,Carleton University
106,Nonlinear Wave Resonances in Continuous Media ( 2014/15-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/596,"Resonances are a fundamental aspect of physical phenomena in settings ranging from fluid mechanics to acoustics to optics. They are generally characterized by a constructive interaction between external forcing and natural internal frequencies. While the immediate mechanism is well understood, the long term effects of such interactions can be quite varied and depend on a multitude of factors. A robust literature has emerged over recent decades to model and investigate resonant phenomena, but numerous fundamental questions remain. Given the distinct mathematical features which arise when dispersive effects are present, this proposal has two primary and parallel themes, one where dispersive effects are present (e.g. nonlinear sloshing) and one where they are not (e.g. acoustic resonators). The focus of this proposal will be on resonances in gas and fluid settings as these represent both tractable and broadly applicable regimes. For the non-dispersive case, based on the conservation principles embodied by the Euler Equations for inviscid flow, various systems will be modelled and studied. Of primary interest will be how the qualitative nature of the long term response depends on the underlying geometric and material (density) profiles. It is well known that in some cases (e.g. shock tubes) a discontinuous response arises, while in other cases (e.g. spherical resonators) the profile, while amplified, remains continuous. The nature of the transition between these cases is not well understood. A key objective of the present proposal will be to address this fundamental question by studying and characterising the transition regime linking them. This will involve detailed analysis of the solution structure and asymptotic scalings, leading to further insights into the underlying mechanisms. Given that each regime requires a distinct mathematical treatment, this will also involve development and extension of asymptotic techniques in order to establish this connection. Once these fundamental questions are resolved, the models will be extended to include additional effects such as control and combustion, with immediate application to design strategies in various industrial settings such as engines, pumps and compressors.On the dispersive side, the primary focus of the present proposal will be on nonlinear sloshing of shallow fluids. Prior work and subsequent generalizations provided an asymptotic framework for the steady state periodic response in the limit that dispersive effects are small. However experiments have shown that while one-dimensional effects do persist in two and three dimensional settings, there are significant limitations. Therefore the first objective of the present study will be to extend the previous results to higher dimensions with a view towards understanding of resonant response in more general geometric settings. This in turn will involve further refinement of the layer based asymptotic methodology with particular attention to the underlying bifurcation structure and potential break-down near bifurcation points. Based on these fundamental investigations, the final objective will be to extend this work to allow for more generalized pitching and surging motions, with important applications, for example, to the design and operation of cargo vessels and tankers. Both the dispersive and non-dispersive aspects will involve a blend of modelling, analysis and numerical simulation. They will afford and necessitate abundant opportunity for student involvement ranging from senior undergraduate to doctoral and postdoctoral levels. They will also not only provide fundamental insights into the underlying resonant mechanisms and outcomes, but also the opportunity for direct application in an array of industrial settings.",David Amundsen,Carleton University
107,Novel Thin Film Biomaterials for Tissue Engineering ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/23683,"Deposition of thin films and etching via the use of cold (thermodynamically non-equilibrium) low-pressure (LP) plasmas achieved prominence in information technology since the 1960s. Those two processes and a third, surface modification of polymers, are now also being used in many other industries. Recently, there has been much progress in implementing atmospheric-pressure (AP) cold plasmas, mostly the dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) variety, for those three process categories. Beside direct use of LP and AP plasmas, it is also possible to carry out such processes by vacuum-ultraviolet (VUV, lambda = 200 nm) photo-chemistry, since commercial (plasma-based) VUV sources can efficiently convert electrical energy into short-wavelength photons. A potential advantage of (mono-energetic) photo- chemistry over (LP- and AP-) plasma is that the former may result in more targeted reactions, with higher yields of the desired products. Research in the applicants laboratory of all types (LP, AP, VUV) above has over the years resulted in well over 400 refereed publications, in two dozen patents, and in much technology transfer to industry. He proposes innovative research focused on novel AP plasma techniques and on thin organic films deposited on suitable substrates for use in bio-technological (e.g. tissue engineering) applications. Such coatings must be rich in certain types of chemical functionalities, for example in primary amines (-NH 2 ), carboxylic (COOR), hydroxyl (-OH), or thiol (-SH) groups, they must adhere strongly to various substrate materials, must resist aging in atmosphere and dissolution in aqueous (cell-culture) media, among other criteria. Finally, of course, they must first and foremost elicit the desired bio-response from the cell-type(s) being cultured. This latter aspect calls for close collaboration with specialists in the cell-biological and medical sciences that are being addressed in any given sub-project. During the past decade, the applicants laboratory has developed networks of collaborations, mostly with senior researchers in the medical faculty of McGill and Montreal universities. In the recent past NSERC specifically included Plasma Applications among areas of Interdisciplinary Materials Research that possess particularly high potential for socioeconomic impact; Plasma Medicine (PM) clearly can benefit healthcare for Canadians, as it already has in Europe.",Michael Wertheimer,Polytechnique Montréal
108,"On the strategic interactions between defined benefit pension, debt, and equity claimants ( 2014/15-2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/120538,"Defined benefit pension plans play an important role in the compensation structures of large, public corporations. For example, the combined market capitalization of U.S. defined benefit (DB) plan sponsors represented approximately 80% of the market cap of NYSE listed firms even as recently as 2008. Management of DB plans requires ongoing monitoring of plan liabilities and prudent administration of the assets set aside to fund these liabilities using input from senior officers of the firm and representatives of plan beneficiaries. Our proposed research will address strategic decision making associated with DB liabilities and assets. Although DB liabilities, net of their funded amount, are typically considered to be just another financial obligation of the firm, our research will more thoroughly examine the interaction between plan liabilities and assets, and the equity and debt obligations of the firm. We will develop theory to address the following unanswered questions: 1) Should we expect DB plans to increase or decrease the borrowing capacity of a firm? 2) How do DB plans affect renegotiation in financial distress? 3) In light of the interactions between DB liabilities and financial liabilities, what funding strategies give rise to maximum equity value? 4) How does the presence of a DB plan affect the pricing of a firm's financial liabilities? A key driver of strategic behavior is the relative bargaining power of the claimants in bankruptcy. DB plan liabilities typically have a senior claim on the DB plan assets, but are subordinate claims to the general assets of the firm. This reversal of priority gives rise to different strategic behavior on the part of labour, debt, and equity claimants, depending on the value of plan assets. For example, when a plan is well-funded, debt claimants have the most to gain from an effective reorganization of the financial liabilities of the firm, whereas when a plan is poorly-funded it is the pension claimants who have the most to gain. As a result of this effect, we would predict different bargaining coalitions and outcomes depending on whether the DB plan is in deficit or surplus. Bargaining outcomes in distress have a direct impact on the valuation of debt claims. Prior work has not considered the differential impact of DB asset versus operating asset values on debt values. Our work will provide new, testable empirical predictions for debt valuation dynamics when a DB plan is present. In so doing, our findings will interest not only experts in the area of pension research but also financial economists with general interest in the valuation and risk profiles of debt claims. A key determinant of the debt capacity of a firm is the value of these claims in the event of financial distress. The explicit inclusion of labour at the bargaining table in distress, in their role as pension liability claimants, fundamentally changes the possible redistributions of wealth. As a consequence, the capital structure decisions of firms with DB plans will be fundamentally different from those of firms without such plans. Our work will explicitly formulate and solve for the optimal capital structure of a firm when a DB plan is present. Our results will also be of interest to Investment bankers, the CFOs of the companies they advise and equity and debt research associates, who advise on claim valuation.",Murray D Carlson,University of British Columbia

Despite these gains, we have shown that arm and leg use after traditional rehabilitation declines dramatically after returning home. My overarching vision is to enable health and independence in stroke survivors by devising and implementing innovative self-management tools to enhance recovery, and ensure that functional gains are maximized and maintained to optimize long-term outcomes.My goal is to optimize motor recovery by incorporating principles of self-management with a strong focus on empowering patients, mutual goal-setting and self-monitoring by the patient and family/caregivers. Activities from my three current CIHR Open Operating grants (all held as Nominated Principal Investigator (PI), with two just awarded) provide the foundation for my goal.Objective 1: Develop interventions to motivate arm and leg use after stroke, utilizing behavioural change strategies to determine whether:1a) A novel telehealth program can improve daily physical activity (and hence leg and mobility function) and reduce secondary complications and health care utilization after stroke; and1b) A telehealth-supported self-managed arm and hand program can improve upper extremity functional outcomes.Objective 2: Develop and validate wearable sensor technologies to improve therapist’s ability to monitor and progress exercise; and facilitate patient self-monitoring within a self-management approach to improve physical activity or upper extremity function. Specifically, we will develop:2a) An Arm Rehabilitation Monitor to count arm and hand motions and2b) A Slow Step Sensor Monitor to record steps when walking slow.These wearable sensors will enhance future iterations of studies to achieve objective 1.Team and Partnerships: I will continue to use an integrated KT model and implement and disseminate my interventions worldwide through publications, user manuals, websites and conferences. My research will be informed by knowledge users, as well as Program Experts in telehealth, engineering, biostatistics, health economics, psychology and medicine. My location at the GF Strong Rehab Centre, the largest rehab centre in BC, has enabled me to establish partnerships locally, with all five BC Health Authorities, as well as nationally and abroad.Training Activities: I will support the career pathways of trainees and junior researchers via my roles as 1) Director, Rehab Research Program, Vancouver Coastal Health Research Institute; 2) Team Leader with expected new training of 10 PhDs, 5 post-doctoral fellows, and 15 undergraduates over the 7-year period; and 3) senior mentor and collaborator of 10 clinicians and 8 junior faculty.Impact of Research: My Foundation research program will result in the development and implementation of new evidence-based telehealth self-management programs and innovative wearable sensor technologies.

Optimizing care for people with multiple chronic diseases is challenging, and different tools for patients and their health care providers have been created to improve how chronic diseases are managed. Although these tools have potential, most are created for a single disease, which doesn't address the needs of most seniors who have multiple chronic conditions. The first objective of this research project is to create a ""pathway"" for the creation of good quality tools that can address the best possible management of seniors with chronic conditions. I call this process the ""Pathway to Tools for Healthy Seniors"" or PATH-S. As a first step, I will use the results from a review of the literature to develop a draft version of PATH-S.

I call this the ""Aging Well"" tool. The senior population is rapidly increasing, so the results of this research project has potential to improve care for many seniors who suffer from at least two chronic conditions.

112,Parent engagement and ADHD risk: reciprocal relationships in early elementary school ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113062,"Overwhelming evidence suggests that young children with symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) experience significant academic impairments. For instance, symptoms of ADHD in children as early as kindergarten are associated with substantial underachievement throughout the elementary school years and beyond. Importantly, the school failure and poor school-related outcomes in this population are predictive of substantial socio-economic, educational, and health adversities later in life (Kuriyan et al., 2013). Although parent-mediated interventions have been found to improve ADHD symptoms and behavioral outcomes (Daley et al., 2014), these interventions have demonstrated less efficacy for school-related outcomes (DuPaul & Stoner, 2014). Recently, a focus on parent engagement in the learning of children with ADHD has emerged, and shows promise for improving scholastic outcomes, yet much remains unknown about the underlying mechanisms of change. This information is essential if we are to understand how parents and educators can best support the learning and social-emotional development of these children in the formative early years of schooling. The proposed school-based research project will span four years. Beginning when the participants are in senior kindergarten, we will use a multi-informant approach to collect data directly with students, as well as through well-validated survey information from their parents and teachers. We will follow the same students through the 1st and 2nd grade. Kindergarten students from 30 classrooms in 12 schools will be invited to participate, and we estimate approximately 360 students and their parents and teachers will participate. We have a committed school board partner for this project, with a broad economic, linguistic, ethnic, and cultural diversity profile, that includes urban and suburban communities. We will use a community sample that allows for the dimensional measurement of ADHD to include children exhibiting sub-clinical levels of ADHD symptoms, as well as those with more impairing behaviours but who have not yet received a diagnosis. Using a longitudinal design involving multiple-sources, data will be collected each year on: (a) an array of parent engagement variables, (b) student ADHD symptoms, (c) student academic and social-emotional outcomes, and (d) selected covariates. Informed by the current state of the field, including both theoretical and empirical literature, we have developed a Theory of Change to guide our core research questions. Specifically, the project will investigate reciprocal relationships between parent engagement and child ADHD symptoms starting in kindergarten, and how these relationships influence academic and social-emotional outcomes. This original program of research will advance both theory and practice in the field. First, by employing a rigorous theory-informed design, this project will deepen our knowledge about the risk associated with early ADHD symptoms in your children, thereby providing a better understanding this vulnerable population of students. Second, it will empirically decipher the interactive role of early ADHD behaviours and parent engagement in children's early development. In light of the known adversities associated with ADHD, this project has several important applications. It will yield important information for families of children with ADHD, as well as for our educational system that is striving to support these students. Our hope is that this project will inform the development of more efficacious supports for students with ADHD, thereby diverting their developmental trajectories to more promising outcomes.","Maria A Rogers, Jessica .M L Whitley, Julia A Ogg","University of Ottawa, University of Ottawa, University of Ottawa"

We learned that supporting healthcare workers requires attention to the marathon of occupational stress, not just the sprint of dramatic stressors that occur while infections are dominating the news. At our hospital, we routinely provide a range of supportive resources for staff, which depend on their needs and often depend on staff actively seeking support. This study's goal is to test if the well-being of hospital workers facing a novel coronavirus outbreak is improved by adding Peer Support Champions: an interdisciplinary team of professionals who actively monitor for early signs of heightened stress within clinical teams, liaise between staff and senior management to improve organizational responsiveness, and provide direct support and teaching (under the supervision of experts in resilience, infection control, and professional education). We will test the effectiveness of Enriched Support by rolling it out to different parts of the hospital in stages, comparing levels of burnout before and after the intervention reaches particular teams and units (this is called a stepped wedge design). By the end of the study, we will have provided Enriched Support to all of our clinical and research staff and many learners (> 6,000 people). We will test the effectiveness of the Peer Support Champions by measuring trends in burnout and other effects of stress over the course of the study in a subgroup of these hospital workers (~1000 people). We have assembled a team of experts in infection prevention and control, healthcare workers' stress and resilience, and continuous professional education.

( 2017/18-2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112687,"Elected officials and senior public servants in Westminster systems continue to rely on policy advice from a variety of sources, but important changes have occurred in the policy advisory systems (PAS) within which they are embedded. The transformation of Westminster PAS in recent decades has marginalized the roles of some advisory units while favouring others, with major implications for governance and policy-making (Rhodes, Wana, and Weller 2010; Craft and Halligan forthcoming). PAS are more open and encompasses a wider range of policy experts and policy has also become much more complex, and crosses boundaries of organisations inside and outside government. This exploratory study will be the first to provide a comparative empirical examination of PAS demand side dynamics in the 'classic' Westminster administrative tradition (United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand). PAS recognize that important distinctions can characterize the configuration and influence of advisory units in jurisdictions and policy areas, and those units and the systems themselves can over time (Halligan 1995; Craft and Wilder forthcoming). Two trends have been most apparent in PAS change: an externalization of advice (from the public service) linked to a growing non-public service advisory supply, politician's desire for alternative perspectives, and the erosion of public service policy capacity. Second, a politicization of policy advice due to more assertive political executives, the rise of appointed political staffs, politicization of senior public sector appointments, and heightened partisanship of politicians (Craft and Howlett 2013; Eichbaum and Shaw 2010; Zussman 2015; Savoie 2015; Weller 2015). This PAS research has however focused almost exclusively on supply side dynamics – predominantly on the capacity and capability of the public service, to provide advice to decision makers. Important questions remain regarding the demand side of PAS. What types of policy advice do bureaucratic (department heads) and political (decision makers) now require? How well are they being served by their respective advisory systems? As well, comparative study is needed to assess how the demand for policy advice has changed and with what implications for policymaking. While the public service is often examined from a supply side perspective it is also a significant consumer of policy advice itself. Much remain unknown about how PAS transformation may be reshaping its demand. The implications of the above are significant for the Westminster administrative tradition tied to how PAS are adapting and performing, as well as how various units interact and seek to exert influence in governance. Key questions are: 1. To empirically examine and compare the policy advisory demands of government ministers and department heads, and how they approach the acquisition of policy advice.2. To analyse how and when they make use of the expanded PAS to draw advice from different sources3. To compare how the PAS used in four Westminster countries, including Canada, operate within, and adapt, the Westminster administrative tradition.4. To examine the current demand for policy advice against the long-term changes to policy advisory systems.5. To develop a framework and indicators for the analysis of PAS demand.This research will be highly relevant to political science, public administration and management, and public policy fields. Its utility also extends to government ministers and senior public servants in each jurisdiction engaged in generating, brokering, and consuming policy advice. This comparative analysis will provide improved understanding of how advisory dynamics play out in Westminster systems, and across different policy domains. The study also offers significant opportunity to empirically verify conceptual developments in PAS scholarship such as the degrees of externalization and politicization. The study aims to develop a set of demand-side indicators and a framework to assess demand side dynamics which will be applicable to various cases and to PAS analysis over time. The project team is committed to extensive engagement with the scholarly community, policy makers, and in making their research accessible to the broader public throughout all phases of the two-year project.",jonathan Craft,University of Toronto
115,"Politics, Physiology, and Cognition: Advances in Theory and Method ( 2018/19 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184137,"Western democracies are experiencing significant challenges: the rise of nativist and populist political parties; intense debates around immigration and the accommodation of diversity; and a complex news environment that itself has become a source of public discussion and politicisation. To understand these phenomena, political scientists have increasingly been drawing on a broader, interdisciplinary literature on cognition, psychology and physiology. A growing body of literature demonstrates a connection between physiological processes such as genetics, neurophysiology, cognition and political attitudes. This research suggests that individual ideological development depends on a complex interaction between social and biological factors. Yet, the results emerging from this budding field have yet to be fully integrated into our understanding of public opinion: how and why do individuals develop different political attitudes. This workshop assembles a cross disciplinary, international group of leading experts from communications, economics, philosophy, political science, neuroscience, and sociology to address pressing questions on the relationship between human cognition, physiology, and the development of political attitudes. For example, what is the relationship between ideological positions and physiological processes such as arousal? What are the physiological processes associated with prejudicial attitudes and how do these impact policy attitudes? How do differences in political attitudes effect reception with media and political messages? How does the connection with physiological processes affect how researchers should approach the study of politics? The focus of the workshop is on four critical areas in the application of cognitive and physiological approaches: 1) ideological differences; 2) social prejudices; 3) political communication; and 4) theory and practice. By assembling a panel of experts to address questions in these areas, this event will facilitate the development of new research methods for the study of political behaviour. This workshop also aims to provide young scholars, especially in political science, with training in the use of cognitive and physiological methods. We have arranged for a group of experts to conduct a series of hands on methodology demonstrations, focusing on new technologies applicable to political science including the measurement of: implicit cognitive processing; skin conductance, and emotional facial expressions. We have also partnered with the Association of Politics and Life Sciences to offer a call to research in which young scholars can apply for one of seven research grants worth $1500 USD. Aimed at providing research training these grants require students to collaborate with senior scholars to construct well-developed research designs and theoretically-grounded hypotheses, that will provide an important opportunity to develop research skills and publish. Promoting training in pathbreaking methods as well as experience in research designs are fundamentals in scholarly careers. Consequently this workshop makes an impactful contribution to the development of future scholars. The centerpiece of the workshop will be the publication of journal articles by senior scholars on the theoretical and methodological significance of including cognitive and physiological approaches to the study of politics. These articles will be published as perspective pieces in the Politics and Life Sciences at Cambridge University Press. The secondary outcomes will be training scholars in the application of new research technologies and the research projects developed by young scholars, which will also be published in Politics and Life Sciences as a special issue on Politics, Physiology, and Cognition.","Jordan Mansell, Allison Harell","Université du Québec à Montréal, Université du Québec à Montréal"
116,"Population health analytics in action: Improving impact, sustainability & equity of the health care system ( 2016/17-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147860,"Confidence in Canada's health care and public health systems has been eroded by evidence of the country's declining performance across a range of measures of healthcare delivery and population health. Further, given rising healthcare costs, it is increasingly important to identify which resource investments will result in the greatest benefits for the health of Canadians and health delivery systems. The challenge for decision makers is how to use the best available data to estimate the impact of various prevention and healthcare approaches on overall health and economic outcomes. To address this gap, my program will develop new measures of health system functioning and practical tools to inform system planning using large, linked databases of health, social, and cost-related information. These outputs will offer an innovative and meaningful way to examine how well the health system is functioning (e.g., at what cost and for whom?), health inequities among Canadians, health system inefficiencies and priorities for action. To ensure that our findings are relevant and useful, my research program will provide analyses directly to team of senior health and social decision makers who can use the results and tools developed to weigh the costs and benefits of various cross-sectoral strategies. A key the strength lies in working with decision makers from multiple provinces and across various sectors (e.g., health care, public health, social services), which will result in solutions that are integrated across the broader system and at various levels (e.g. regionally, provincially). Ultimately this proposal offers a promising way to effectively improve population health and efficiently use health resources to optimize health system synergy and population impact.",Laura C Rosella,University of Toronto
117,Positioning Canada as an international leader in addiction research and education to improve care and reduce costs to the health care system ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147623,"In Canada, untreated alcohol and drug addiction contributes to substantial morbidity, mortality and community concerns (e.g., drug crime). Despite the enormous burden of disease attributable to harmful drug use, there remain major challenges in implementing evidence-based prevention and treatment modalities for substance use disorders. This proposal aims to address these urgent concerns by building upon an internationally recognized track record of research involving street-involved youth, people living with HIV/AIDS and people struggling with addiction, which has translated into major health care savings and public health gains for vulnerable populations. Through observational and interventional research investigating novel approaches to substance abuse prevention and treatment for street-involved populations, my research also seeks to continue to serve as a major platform for education and knowledge translation into improved health policies, services and outcomes. The specific objectives of this program are: •To investigate and address health-related harms (e.g., HIV infection) among street-involved youth, and to develop novel strategies to prevent and treat drug addiction among this population; •To develop and test novel strategies for improving HIV prevention and treatment programs for HIV-positive and HIV-negative people who use drugs, with the goal of reducing morbidity, mortality and HIV incidence; •To conduct addiction clinical trials as part of national and international clinical trial networks in order to identify new therapeutic approaches and interventions for substance misuse, as well as scale up the use of proven interventions in various community settings; •To integrate graduate student and clinician research training and fill a research void by training the next generation of scientists in addiction medicine research. (line separator)In addition to well established collaborations with an international network of researchers, educators, service providers, policy makers and advocacy groups, the Program Experts for this proposal include interdisciplinary scientists and knowledge users (e.g., Provincial Medical Health Officer, senior staff in the BC Ministry of Health) who are committed to integrating research, treatment, education and knowledge translation toward improving the lives of populations affected by substance use. As Professor of Medicine at the University of British Columbia, where I hold a Tier 1 Canada Research Chair in Inner City Medicine, I am well positioned to lead this program of research.This research program will continue to build on its track record of excellence in knowledge creation and translation, having already contributed to more than 400 peer-reviewed manuscripts, including publications in top-ranking journals (e.g., JAMA, Lancet, New England Journal of Medicine); presentations to Canadian House of Commons committees; and more than 600 media quotations in high profile lay media (e.g., LA Times, CNN, Globe and Mail). Continuing my commitment to mentorship and career development for more than 100 trainees to date, this program will also seamlessly integrate training for graduate and undergraduate students and clinician researchers in order to fill Canada’s void in addiction research. Ultimately, this program—which scored in the 95th percentile in Phase 1—will reduce health and social costs by improving health policies, systems and outcomes for populations affected by substance use and related harms.",Evan Wood,University of British Columbia
118,Precarious noncitizenship through the life course ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/115372,"Over the last two decades, Canadian immigration policy has shifted dramatically, reducing the share of permanent resident entrants and increasing that of people arriving as temporary residents. At the same time, the proportion of permanent residents with prior experience as temporary residents is increasing. Thus, whether they enter on temporary work visas, student visas, tourist visas, as family dependents or as asylum seekers, many migrants in Canada spend an indeterminate amount of time in a state of immigration status precarity. While some eventually become permanent residents, others churn through temporary and unauthorized statuses. Thus, although envisioned by official policy as short-term, precarious immigration status is increasingly becoming a form of or path to de facto settlement in Canada, with precarious-status migrants living in economic vulnerability with limited access to social services and citizenship rights. As such, immigration status has the potential to become a primary fault line of social stratification in Canada, intersecting significantly with racialization, gender, and age. Available research confirms the long-term negative impacts of living and working with forms of precarious immigration status on access to services (e.g. health, education) and on employment quality and precarity, income, the social determinants of health, housing and other aspects of well-being. However, existing scholarship is limited by a fragmented approach to precarious status that focuses on single entrance categories; a linear approach to legal status trajectories that ignores complex trajectories that may include moves toward greater and decreased legal security; insufficient attention to how institutional contact between citizens and noncitizens in multiple arenas can overlap to shape access and/or barriers to work, health, education, and other services. This Greater Toronto Area-based PDG will address these knowledge gaps and attend to both the Insight and Connections program goals. It proposes a transformative and integrated research and knowledge mobilization strategy to study and understand how precarious noncitizenship is transforming experiences of work, social citizenship and belonging over the life course, and in ways that impact society as a whole. The project will bring together community agency partners, advocacy organizations, persons living with precarious legal status and academic researchers who will use ethnographic methods from a community-based participatory action research (CBPAR) framework. Together, they will design and conduct three case studies of precarious noncitizenship through the life course, focusing on youth, working age women and seniors. This will allow the team to examine and co-produce knowledge about the multiple intersections of age, entrance category, gender, and racialization; legal status trajectories; and patterns of institutional contact across various arenas (the labour market, health, education, services for youth, women and seniors). Our knowledge mobilization goals include training and mentoring for community and academic partnership members that will provide transferable skills and capacities. These include CBPAR experience, cross-sectoral communications and work experience, qualitative interviewing and ethnographic methods, clear language writing, blogging and social media communications, and film development and production. Products of the knowledge mobilization include plain language reports; infographics; a comprehensive website to house project materials; a town hall meeting; and a short fiction film based on research material that showcases the experiences of precarious noncitizens over the life course.","Patricia Landolt, Min Sook Lee, Luin Goldring","University of Toronto, OCAD University, York University"
120,Private participation in infrastructure investment: an analysis of project consortium ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113464,"Most countries are facing the pressing need to substantially increase investment in infrastructure to meet social and economic needs. According to the OECD (2015b), total required investment in global infrastructure (e.g., transport, electricity generation and transmission, water and waste water, telecommunication) by 2030 will amount to approximately USD 70 trillion, which represents about 3.5% of the world's GDP. Most governments recognize that they cannot meet the financial need for infrastructure investment through tax revenues or aid alone, and that greater participation by private investors in infrastructure sector is necessary. Private participation in infrastructure not only reduces pressure on public finances but also introduces much needed technical and managerial expertise (Conference Board of Canada, 2010). Canadian firms, such as SNC Lavalin, Hatch, ScotiaBank, and Royal Bank of Canada, have in fact been on the frontier of private participation in infrastructure investment in domestic and global markets (Inframation, 2016). The development of an infrastructure project is often led by an investment consortium, also called special investment vehicle (SPV), that consists of domestic and international private investors (also called sponsors). In this study, we will focus on the characteristics and performance of investment consortia. Prior research on private participation in the infrastructure sector has primarily focused on macro-level analysis of aggregate capital flows and financial structure and instruments employed by investing firms to mitigate investment risks (Doh & Ramamurti, 2003; Kleimeier & Versteeg, 2010). However, in-depth analysis of investor, investor consortium or project attributes is lacking. Hence, our understanding of organizational dynamics underlying the development of individual infrastructure investment projects is limited. The proposed research program aims to address this research gap. Specifically, our analysis will explore a consortium's organizational attributes such as inter-sponsor diversity, sponsors' experience, and the distinct roles of corporate and financial sponsors. It will also examine the outcomes of procurement bids among competing consortia. Winning a competitive bid for an infrastructure facility is the first and most crucial step in project development from an investor's point of view. In contrast to the emphasis of extant literature on project financing (Gatti, 2013), our focus on organizational antecedents to project success can yield new insights into how private investors can form effective consortia, manage investment risks, and improve their performance. The PI (Jiang, Carleton University) and the collaborator (Jimenez, KEDGE Business School, France) will be applying a multi-method approach that involves both qualitative and quantitative analyses, with a doctoral research assistant. We plan to first interview 15-20 senior managers from the infrastructure sector in Canada and France. Their insights and our in-depth literature review will guide us in developing a theoretical model with testable hypotheses. We will then test the model using a project-based, large-sample archival dataset. Findings will be shared through presentations at academic conferences and publications in scholarly and practitioner-oriented journals. Our study will be of interest to many Canadian and international firms engaged in this growing sector, as well as policy researchers focusing on this phenomenon. More specifically, the findings will have the potential to inform the formulation of firms' strategies on forming and managing project consortia, and public policies -- particularly from the current federal government - that encourage more inflows of private capital to the sector.",Guoliang Jiang,Carleton University
123,Psychological immersion in the museum: its educational and social benefits in young adults and older adults ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109930,"Aware of being important institutions of Western society, museums hope to create an intense, enriching and beneficial experience for their visitors. They are nowadays being tempted by immersive environments created by new technologies, for these environments are supposed to create universes into which visitors are physically plunged, physical immersion ensuring psychological immersion, and thus an intense experience. Unfortunately, producing such environments is costly and, for various reasons, visitors seldom enjoy such experiences. However, fascination for an object, likely to occur in any exhibition, may create a moment of psychological immersion corresponding to such keen attention and such strong cognitive, imaginary and affective functioning that the visitor forgets all the rest. Moreover, currents of present-day research suggest major benefits from these processes. They may be seen, for instance, as participating in the intellectual and affective development of the visitor and thus as benefits of a personal-growth type related to the museum's educational role. Moreover, they might consist in an enhancement of positive emotions, a reduction of negative emotions, intellectual fatigue and stress level that are all consequences contributing to an individual's wellbeing. Since these latter benefits have a direct influence on mental health and an indirect effect on physical health, the museum, by encouraging them, would fulfill a significant part of its social role. We organize the present project into two parts. In the first, we investigate what happens during psychological immersion, in other words how cognitive, imaginary and affective functioning operate, and we do so by capturing the interplay of these processes at the very moment that immersion takes place. In the second part, we investigate the benefits of immersion based on a list of elements borrowed from various research projects on personal growth and wellbeing. We study immersion and benefits in a fine arts museum, a history museum, an archaeology museum and a natural sciences museum in order to verify how immersion might be affected by different types of objects. We do this research with two distinct groups: one consisting of young adults at work and aged 30-64 and the other a group of seniors retirees aged 65 and over. The former at present constitute the main public of Canadian museums, whereas the latter, not yet so well known to museums, will soon represent a very large public. The originality of the project comes mainly from the fact of not only showing that immersion is possible without the intervention of costly devices, but also to that of identifying its content and benefits. Museum education as a field of study, museums, and the population as a whole will profit from this research. It will provide museum education with the identification of the components of one of its main concepts and with a new investigation instrument. Museums will receive the information they need for the development of exhibitions that favour immersion and so become particularly interesting to visitors. They will thus be able to demonstrate to the State and to their donors the importance of their educational and social roles and obtain their increased support. Moreover, they will obtain data concerning older adults, one of their major future publics. Finally, at least a third of the Canadian population will profit from immersion, for that is the proportion that now frequents museums in many provinces, including Quebec.","Colette Dufresne-Tassé, Anne-Marie Émond, None None","University of Montreal, University of Montreal, University of Montreal"

The University of New Brunswick, Fredericton will host the 36th iteration of the conference at the Crown Plaza Lord Beaverbrook Hotel (May 9-11, 2019). Our organizing committee includes undergraduate and graduate students, junior and senior faculty members, and UNB's VP Indigenous Engagement; reflecting the conference's ongoing commitment to mentorship and inclusion of scholars at all levels of the academic spectrum. Qualitatives 2019 offers delegates the opportunity to explore new developments in the ways we use qualitative methods to investigate the social world. The theme for this year's conference, 'The Transdisciplinary Efficacy of Qualitative Methods: Studying Everyday Life, the Empirical Tradition Continues,' highlights the utility of qualitative methodology across disciplines and honours the Qualitatives' emphasis on fieldwork. Two sub-themes include a focus on health, illness, and medicine; chosen for its public policy relevance and a celebration of the 50th Anniversary of the publication of Blumer's (1969) Symbolic Interaction: Perspective and Method, paying homage to the foundational ideas that gave rise to the Qualitatives. Our Key Note Speaker is Dr Joanna Kempner, recipient of the 2016 Eliot Freidson Outstanding Publication Award from the American Sociological Association's Medical Sociology Section. Our Featured Speaker is Dr Joseph Kotarba, winner of the 2014 Charles Horton Cooley Award for Best Book from the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction. The conference's international reputation has attracted an impressive range of submissions. To date we have received abstracts from 168 presenters from 11 countries, representing 31 disciplines; including senior and junior faculty, post-doctoral fellows, graduate and undergraduate student presenters, as well as practitioners and government researchers. We are very pleased that a number of abstracts focus on Indigenous peoples. The mix of presenters creates unique networking opportunities for establishing collaborations and developing research partnerships across disciplines and institutions, as well as between academic and non-academic sectors as diverse as the Toronto School Board and the Department of Defense. The conference sessions, time between sessions, and special events are organized to ensure fruitful knowledge exchange. Students are a valued presence at the Qualitatives. Unlike many other conferences where student status is indicated on name tags and students are grouped into special sessions, the practice of this conference has always been to feature student presenters alongside faculty and to assign students to act as session chairs. This year roughly 50% of the presenters are graduate and undergraduate students, a reflection of the conference's focus on mentoring and professional socialization. The Student/Faculty Networking Lunch brings students together with experienced researchers who share career advice and their expertise in conducting qualitative research. Among the activities planned for Qualitatives 2019 are a qualitative methods workshop and the Instant Ethnography event, a mentoring and learning activity where students are matched with an experienced ethnographer to engage in an ethnographic exercise and talk about their experiences in a session on the last day. We will publish the proceedings from the conference and post videos of the key note and featured speaker presentations on The Qualitatives website. We have also secured a commitment from the international journal Symbolic Interaction to edit a special issue based on papers from the conference.","Jacqueline Low, Deana E Simonetto, Gary L Bowden, Jeffrey D van den Scott, Lisa-Jo K van den Scott","University of New Brunswick, Wilfrid Laurier University, University of New Brunswick, Memorial University of Newfoundland, Memorial University of Newfoundland"
125,Quarks in cosmos and heavy ion collisions ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/203168,"There are fundamental links between cosmology and particle physics, which have been well established at all scales. In particular, the physics of the early Universe, baryogenesis, cosmological nucleosynthesis are based on our modern understanding of particle physics. The goal of the project is the study of QCD in the unusual environment when temperature T, chemical potential and the so-called theta parameter are non-zero. It is generally accepted that the theta parameter was not zero during the QCD epoch in early Universe. It is assumed that the theta parameter relaxes to zero as a result of the dynamics of the axion field, which was postulated 40 years ago to resolve the so-called strong CP problem. The main objective of the proposal is to study a variety of different physics effects related to the dynamics of the axion field during the QCD transition. There are few themes in the project which are inherently related:***1. The analysis in a simplified version of QCD, the so-called ``deformed QCD"" which however preserves all the relevant elements of strongly coupled QCD such as confinement, degeneracy of topological sectors, nontrivial theta dependence, and many other important aspects which allow us to test some fascinating features of strongly interacting QCD. ***2. Application of these fundamentally new ideas to heavy ion collisions, astrophysics and cosmology. In particular, I am closely collaborating with senior astrophysics people and particle physics experimentalists to test a proposal that the dark matter problem and baryogenesis problem are inherently linked to each other and should be solved simultaneously as the observed dark matter density and the observed baryon density are very similar in magnitudes. If these components are originated from different physics they must be drastically different, in contrast with present observations. The key element in this proposal is the presence of non-vanishing CP-odd parameter theta which generates the observed asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the Universe as a result of the so-called charge separation effect. This proposal gives very specific and unique predictions which can be tested by a number of existing and upgraded instruments such as upgraded CAST (CERN Axion Search Telescope). ***3.The third part of my project is based on the observation that very subtle elements of the theoretical construction from item 1 could be tested in a table top experiment. The measuring of the so-called Topological Casimir Effect (TCE) may shed some light on the nature of the so-called vacuum energy. Similar table top experiment could be designed to be sensitive to the theta parameter itself in the Maxwell Theory. The suggested idea on measuring of the TCE is very different from all previous proposals which are sensitive to the derivatives of theta, but not to theta parameter itself. ***",Ariel Zhitnitsky,University of British Columbia
126,Re-Sounding Difference: Creating Accessible Music Theatre for Children with Exceptionalities and Senior Citizens ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183551,"While the personal and societal benefits of participating in music are well documented, access to these opportunities remains inequitable, thus limiting the stories, ideas, bodies, and voices that inform our cultural products, and depriving our most vulnerable citizens of the opportunity to engage in activities that could improve their well-being and quality of life. This research project innovates universal design principles and inclusive strategies for music theatre development with children with exceptionalities and senior citizens, so that all people, despite their age or ability, might participate in music theatre. This proposed research study aims to provide solutions to the lack of access to music theatre, and a lack of understanding of how music theatre participation can support the well-being of children with exceptionalities and senior citizens. These two populations cross gender, sexual orientation, ethnic and socio-economic and (dis)ability groups, and together comprise a significant portion of Canada's population (Statistics Canada, 2012; 2017). While the use of music in social and/or community interventions is well documented, these activities are often limited to individual music making (comprising most work that traditional music therapists do) or participation in ensembles such as the string or choral programs that Sistema programs are built around. Few studies with these populations have incorporated music theatre, though its flexible and multi-modal nature (any combination of music and theatre) offers many varied and rich creative opportunities. More significantly, research and practice in music theatre has not begun to explore what truly accessible performance and production models might look like. Thus this research is poised to make a striking contribution to both the scholarly literature and to professional practice. A two-year multiple-case study methodology will be employed to examine the music theatre creation process and product with children with exceptionalities and senior citizens along with changes in their well-being. We will video record rehearsals and performances to examine the ways that the creation of music theatre with these populations challenges and broadens the genre. By experimenting with activities and approaches that challenge the dichotomy of dis/ableism, and by responding throughout the process to the needs of our participants, our research-creation approach will propose accessible music theatre strategies that embrace diversity in its myriad forms. We will also collect data from individuals (children and seniors) to examine the extent to which participation supports their well-being. We will use PERMA well-being (Seligman, 2011) as a theoretical framework to examine how participation in these activities supported participants' well being through the generation of positive emotions, engagement, relationships, meaning, and accomplishment (PERMA). We will employ age and ability appropriate data collection tools (e.g., photos, game-based tools) to ensure inclusive participation in the data collection, and we will use the same data collection techniques and instruments for each of the case studies. Common data collection procedures will allow for a cross-case examination to elucidate commonalities between the two populations thus articulating universal/inclusive design principles for music theatre participation. Most significantly, this research will disrupt the conservative aesthetics of the genre of music theatre, and will use music theatre to unsettle engrained ideas about the differently abled in our society.","Julia E Brook, Colleen L Renihan","Queen's University, Queen's University"
128,Regulation of vascular responsiveness to changes in metabolic demand ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/16275,"Objectives of my research program The overall goal of my research program is to better understand how oxygen (O2) is transported and optimally distributed to the active tissues (skeletal muscles) to meet changes in O2 demand (i.e., moving from rest to higher intensities of exercise). My scientific approach I use exercise interventions to determine how effectively the vessels transporting O2 respond. Additionally, I study how aging and fitness status affect this transport of O2. For example, it is known that aging has negative effects on the O2 transport system (less responsive vessels). However, research has shown that highly trained people (even seniors) do not show a pronounced deterioration. Thus, I am interested in understanding whether the processes that affect these diminished responses are related to aging per se or to the lack of exercise that compromises the function of the vessels. My experimental approach includes non-invasive and minimally invasive studies using a human model. In this model, I use a number of non-invasive methodologies to examine O2 transport (blood flow) to the active muscles and vascular responsiveness (how the vessels react to distribute O2 to certain areas). By using innovative techniques that include measures of O2 consumption and O2 extraction in the muscles, as well as O2 delivery to the muscles, I obtain important information on how O2 is sent to the active parts of the body and how this response is affected by aging and fitness level, so that the processes that affect O2 delivery to the active tissues can be better understood. Additionally, the use of more invasive methodologies (i.e., muscle biopsies) allows me to examine changes at the cellular, molecular, and morphological level that have an impact on vascular control and O2 provision and distribution. Why is this important? My work provides new information (using novel methodologies and data analysis approaches) that can help us better understand how O2 is delivered to the tissues that need it, and what processes are involved in this adjustment. Combining the use of aging and fitness status models is important as these two factors are known to affect how the vessels respond and thus, they can provide us with more ways of learning about the factors that determine how the vessels make adjustments to deliver O2 to the right places. Increasing our knowledge in this area is very important to be able to provide adequate information on how the vessels function.",Juan Murias,University of Calgary
129,Relative contributions of adult daughters and sons to elderly parents' care in India ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112493,"Motivated by the limited attention in scholarly and policy on (married) daughters' contributions to their parents, and the link between the lack of publicly financed old-age support and skewed sex ratios, the proposed two year study will analyse intergenerational patterns of support for elderly parents in daughter-only families in India. In the absence of universal social welfare and pension, the expectation of old age support is one of the main factors driving strong son preference, daughter aversion and the resulting daughter elimination in India. In a patri-/virilocal context such as in India where daughters move to their husbands' place post-marriage, married sons (and their wives) are seen as responsible for the care of their elderly parents. Yet there is limited evidence on whether it is indeed the case that daughters do not contribute financially or otherwise to their natal families. The discourse that (married) daughters will not care for their parents, hence the need for a son is best examined by focusing on daughter only families. The focus on support for elderly parents in daughter only families is thus original. Theoretically the proposed research will be located within an interdisciplinary framework as people's lives as well as the reproduction of families are embedded within political, socio-economic, spatial and cultural contexts. Specifically the study lies at the intersection of gender and generation. While the current (limited) research in India focuses on elderly care in isolation, the proposed study brings together gender and intergenerational dynamics, as elderly care cannot be studied in isolation, it has to be examined in conjunction with the value of and expectations from children.The study will focus on the North-western Indian state of Haryana and the South Indian state of Kerala which offer contrasting socio-cultural contexts especially with regard to women's status, son preference and daughter deficit. It will be conducted by a multidisciplinary research team. While the focus will be on daughter only families, we will compare daughter only families with son only families and families with both sons and daughters. Primary data collection will include ethnographic interviews and a household survey with the three categories of families across rural and urban areas in each of the two states. We will exploit existing secondary data sources (For example, Census and National Family Health Surveys), analyse policies and programs for the elderly, as well as the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007. Folklore, media representations on the relative worth of sons and daughters, social norms and government policies that facilitate or hinder daughters' ties and contributions to their natal families will also be examined.The proposed study will be the first of its kind to systematically examine care arrangements in daughter only families in India. It will generate insights not only on the empirical context of elderly care in daughter only families but also on the analytical and methodological aspects of scaling up research on the interactions between valuing children and elderly care in India, China and other developing countries where family is an important institution of caring for the elderly. Additionally, like the efforts to bring visibility to women's work in general and to fundamentally challenge the definition of what constitutes work, research is necessary to bring visibility to daughters' roles and contributions, and to change discourses about daughters. The proposed research will generate knowledge that can aid in formulating strategies to strengthen girls' rights and daughter preference. It will also bring visibility to daughters' contributions to their natal families.","Sharada Srinivasan, Arjun Bedi, Arjun Bedi","University of Guelph, Erasmus University Rotterdam, Erasmus University"
131,Reorganizing the Approach to Diabetes through the Application of Registries (RADAR) ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147494,"First Nation (FN) seniors are high risk for diabetes morbidity/mortality and this is compounded by suboptimal care in isolated FN communities. Limited community nursing capacity and a lack of electronic registries/records leads to a reactive, disorganized approach to care. This situation is directly responsible for the poor diabetes related outcomes observed in FN seniors. Health Canada's 2010-2015 Aboriginal Diabetes Initiative calls for innovative, culturally relevant approaches aimed at increasing community wellness and reducing the burden of diabetes through the use of local knowledge. The Canadian Diabetes Association specifically mentions the importance of using systems to identify diabetics and have a systematic follow-up process. The RADAR study fits exactly with these priorities by using health technology information systems and a centralized care coordinator to strengthen FN community capacity. RADAR will establish system-wide, scalable infrastructure (an integrated diabetes registry/records system) that will support front-line community nurses in transforming care for FN seniors with diabetes. The proposed model has two major components to improve the care of FN senior diabetics: 1) Implementation of a common diabetes registry and health records system (eHIPP technology); 2) Care coordinator to support front-line providers for measurement, monitoring and streamlined, coordinated referral and follow-up with use of the technology. We hypothesize that the RADAR model will result in an overall improvement in the quality of clinical care of FN seniors living with diabetes on reserve. We also hypothesize that the RADAR model will be effective, efficient and transferable at the organizational level within these communities and will have a broader public health impact on the population of those with diabetes. Importantly, all outcomes will be assessed from the lens of the FN communities to ensure model is culturally appropriate from their perspective.","Dean Eurich, Jeffrey A Johnson, Sumit R Majumdar","University of Alberta, University of Alberta, University of Alberta"
132,Reparative Frames: Visual Culture After Reconciliation ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184173,"Reparative Frames: Visual Culture after Reconciliation will mark the first public academic gathering to explore the timely and important question of visual culture in and as a practice of reparation. This interdisciplinary and cross-cultural outreach event will bring together senior academics and emerging scholars, as well as artists and curators, in a dynamic format that responds to debates about reconciliation and redress that emerged during Canada's sesquicentennial year, and that connects these issues to international discussions about the unfinished histories of settler colonialism, transatlantic slavery, and forced migration. At the core of this outreach activity is the concept of reparation. We define reparation broadly as both an equitable approach to teaching, representing and learning from difficult histories and an attempt at repairing relations between subjects. Reparation has been adopted as a key conceptual model by many Indigenous groups and cultural commentators internationally, who are motivated, in part, by the sense that the promises of state-sponsored national reconciliation projects of the last three decades have gone unfulfilled. Reparation offers an alternative model through which to articulate and redress asymmetrical relationships of power between subjects and the state. Visual culture---from artworks and exhibitions, to media images and films---has become a key site for critique and for generating encounters that explore the notion of ""repair"" beyond the bounds of the nation-state. Artists, curators, designers, and activists, as well as scholars across a number of intersecting disciplines in the Humanities, Social Sciences, and Fine Arts, mobilize the power of images to shift the responsibility of return and repair away from Indigenous and marginalized communities and onto the reader and viewer. Reparative visual culture, therefore, initiates a call to action that implicates all actors in a system of asymmetrical power relations. Taking a global focus on reparation and visual culture, Reparative Frames addresses four specific objectives: 1. To convene scholars from a range of disciplines and geographic locations to interrogate the meanings of visual culture in and as a process of reparation; 2. To contribute to a broader public debate about reconciliation, sovereignty, and decolonization with the potential to inform government and museum policy formation; 3. To mentor and train students and emerging scholars, facilitating inter-generational dialogue and producing new pedagogical approaches; and 4. To initiate an ongoing collaboration between students, faculty, and practitioners across institutions.. In its very design, Reparative Frames aims to generate meaningful dialogue and mentorship. The outreach event will comprise a one-track, two-day conference with thematic panels of papers by leading national and international scholars as well as the active participation of graduate students and emerging scholars (again, both Canadian and international). Committed to sharing these discussions with broader publics, we are also organizing a keynote roundtable discussion, open to the public. Finally, peer-reviewed triannual international publication, the Journal of Visual Culture, plans to publish a special issue based on the event.","Gabrielle A Moser, Carol Payne","OCAD University, Carleton University"
134,Road Safety Engineering and Senior Drivers ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/9816,"Road Safety Engineering and Senior Drivers While there has been much attention directed to the under-performance of older drivers operating private motor vehicles, little is understood regarding their safety experience in settings that involve higher workloads associated with commercial vehicles such as tractor-trailers, transit buses (urban and inter-city), and school buses. Increased complexity of the driving task is compounded with an inability to self-regulate (e.g., avoid peak traffic periods, inclement weather and night-time hours) which is common among senior drivers of private vehicles. A particular concern has been the recent abolition of mandatory retirement policies in most Canadian jurisdictions that were directed toward school bus drivers. It is now possible for all commercial drivers to continue working beyond the traditional retirement age of 65 years. This study will examine the safety performance of different categories of commercial drivers by age cohort in an attempt to quantify the presumed deterioration of safety performance among the older age groups. These results will be beneficial to support policies and/or countermeasures that target the on-going employment of senior drivers. Another objective of the research program will examine how senior driver crash involvement is responding to changes in vehicle technology and road engineering. While a number of studies have looked at global crash results by different age cohorts, little is understood about the evolution of seniors as the driving environment rapidly changes to include advances in vehicle design, traffic control, and road infrastructure. It is necessary to understand how these changes are affecting both driver crash involvement as well as overall travel mobility so that engineers and policy-makers can respond to changing needs. A second vein of research captured under this proposal will address the general area of school zone safety to exploit the researcher’s expertise in the road safety engineering field. While much effort has addressed so-called safe routes to schools issues, the traffic control measures used to delineate school areas and zones is generally not founded on observed safety performance. Little is understood about collision experience within school zones, yet extraordinary traffic control measures such as speed display units are currently in high public demand in both urban and rural settings.",Eric Hildebrand,University of New Brunswick

136,Scaling up shared decision making for patient-centred care ( 2018/19-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/181780,"Most Canadians wish to stay at home in their old age, but to still have access to healthcare. With new medical technologies (such as alarm bracelets), more and more seniors can stay at home for longer and receive care from home care teams. But seniors living at home often face difficult decisions, such as ""Who will look after me when I can't look after myself any more, or if I have dementia?"" or ""Should I move to a nursing home, or stay here?"" For the caregiver, the decision may be ""Can I continue to care for my loved one at home?"" When more than one option is possible, home care teams can help seniors and their families who are making these hard decisions by giving them the information they need and asking about their values and preferences. This way, seniors and their caregivers can know more about their choices and choose options that reflect what is important to them. We call this 'shared decision making', and it has been shown to improve patient experiences (less disappointment, anxiety or regret) and better use of healthcare dollars. More and more, seniors will be making such decisions in consultation with their home care teams. Over the years we have developed tools and training programs to help home care teams support seniors and their caregivers in making the decision about whether a senior who is no longer independent should stay at home with more help, or move to a nursing home. However, most of our research has been at the regional level. Too many pilot projects that could benefit far more people stay hidden at the local level. So we plan to scale up the tools, programs and systems that seem to work well for one decision and one region. We will adapt and apply them to home care in other places across Canada and to other difficult decisions, so that more seniors and their caregivers benefit from shared decision making and can make decisions together that are better for their health, their pocket, and their quality of life.",France Légaré,Laval University
138,Seniors- Adding Life to Years (SALTY) ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/153909,"Late life is a time when older adults and their caregivers (family and friends) are faced with health and social issues that can impact their well-being. Everyone wants to live well in their final years but this is a challenge, particularly for people in residential long term care settings such as nursing homes. Seniors - Adding Life To Years (SALTY) is a project developed by researchers, care providers, care administrators, policy makers, older adults and their families from across Canada. SALTY aims to add quality to late life for people living in nursing homes and for their caregivers, including family, friends, and volunteers who support their care. SALTY's focus on late life care in nursing homes makes this project unique and urgently needed. Nursing home care in late life is under-researched and undervalued. As a result, care practices, care relationships, effectiveness of innovations, and policy contexts are not well understood. The SALTY team will evaluate promising programs, practices and policies that are being used in nursing homes in four provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Nova Scotia). We will develop innovative strategies to understand and assess impact on quality of care and quality of life, with the aim of spreading effective approaches within and across jurisdictions. SALTY's research is organized into interrelated streams: Monitor Care Practice, Map Promising Approaches to Care Relationships, Evaluate Innovative Practice, and Examine Policy Context. We give special attention to issues of dementia, gender and underrepresented voices in this research. SALTY directly engages decision makers, knowledge users, residents and their caregivers in developing our research, to keep our research findings relevant to policy and practice and to improving quality of late life for nursing home residents and their caregivers.","Janice M Keefe, Denise S Cloutier, Emily G Marshall, Frederick I Burge, Andrea Gruneir, Melissa K Andrew, Greta Cummings, Carole Anne Estabrooks, Pat Armstrong, Hugh Armstrong, Whitney B Berta, Margaret J McGregor, Tamara Daly, Matthias Hoben, Jeff W Poss, Susan Braedley, Whitney B Berta, Ivy L Bourgeault, Kelli I Stajduhar, Jacqueline A Choiniere, Richard G Sawatzky, Catherine M Aubrecht, Catherine M Aubrecht, Richard Sawatzky","Mount Saint Vincent University, University of Victoria, Dalhousie University, Dalhousie University, University of Alberta, Dalhousie University, University of Alberta, University of Alberta, York University, Carleton University, University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, York University, University of Alberta, University of Waterloo, Carleton University, University of Toronto, University of Ottawa, University of Victoria, York University, Trinity Western University, St. Francis Xavier University, Mount Saint Vincent University, Trinity Western University"
139,Smart Donate: A Socio-Techno Intervention of Food Bank Donation ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187349,"Background: Food bank is one of most visible food donation vehicles in Canada. According to the Hunger Count 2016 report, over 800,000 people accessed a food bank in March 2016, a 1.3% increase since 2015 and a 28% increase since 2008. Among all food bank clients, more than 40% of households receiving food are families with children. Around 15% of the households helped were employed and single people living alone (Food Banks Canada, 2016). Vulnerable populations such as children and seniors with restricted income are the major clients for Food Banks. In March 2017, the Penticton Food Bank served 721 individuals in which 33% of those served were families with children (Penticton Food Bank, 2018). Getting enough food to support current Food Banks clients is already a difficult task for many local Food Banks operators. While there is a general misperception that food bank only accept ""food"" products, our study aims increase the awareness of Food Banks through the implementation of a series of social media promotion campaigns and mobile application ""Smart Donate"". At the same time, this project aims to develop a more sustainable donation system for our food bank partner in order to address the demand-availability disconnection current experienced by our community partner. The aim of this study is to implement a customized socio-technological intervention to tackle the current disequilibrium in terms of healthy food and non-food item donations in food bank operations. Proposed Partnership Research: This research proposal is a new extension of the Principal Investigator's (Eric Ping Hung Li) healthy living research and experiential learning program at the University of British Columbia -- Okanagan campus. Dr. Kathy Rush is an expert in public health and telehealth. Dr. Rush's experience in system design and health promotion will benefit the delivery of the new technology-enabled food bank donation system. Dr. Jennifer Davis is a health economist. Her expertise will provide insights to the research team regarding measure the impact of the new socio-technological intervention on individual health as well as organization's operation efficiency. Our partner organization, the Penticton Food Bank, will provide both planning and administrative support to this research. The administrator and staff of the Penticton Food Bank will actively involve in the design and strategic planning processes. The partner organization will also work closely with the UBC research team to launch and monitor the mobile application. The first stage of the research project aims to adopt a UBC-developed mobile application, Smart Donate, to intervene with food bank donation behaviours. The target of this intervention is to increase needed item donations by 10% after the first year of the implementation. The application will also provide an opportunity for researchers to analyze food bank donors' behaviours that could potentially influence the future interface design and donor experience. The second stage of the research study seeks to implement a social marketing campaign to educate donors and the general public about the needs of Food Banks and their clients. Significance: The deliverables from this Partnership Engage research study have potential to inform policy-makers and practitioners about the role of technology in the gift economy and food bank operation. While a significant portion of Canadian citizens are experiencing food security and access to necessities-related challenges, this community-based mobile application seeks to change the donation patterns and mindsets of Food Banks supporters. The long term goal of this research program is to develop a user-friendly and needs-centric donation platforms for Food Banks operators in Canada.","Eric .H P Li, Kathy L Rush, Jennifer C Davis","University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia"
140,Social frailty interventions that can best support vulnerable older adults during the COVID-19 pandemic: A rapid review ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/232387,"By the year 2050, two billion people worldwide will be 60 years of age and older. Global life expectancies are also on the rise, leading to an increased number of seniors who will develop chronic conditions and frailty. Given these projections, frailty is fast becoming a public health concern. Frailty is multidimensional (it affects biological, psychological, and social processes of a person's life), and therefore can lead to reduced functional ability, falls, disability, decreased quality of life, and death. Of the three types of frailty (physical, psychological, and social), social frailty is the least well understood. It is defined as ""a continuum of being at risk of losing, or having lost, social and general resources, activities or abilities that are important for fulfilling one or more basic social needs during the life span"". During public health emergencies such as COVID-19, social vulnerabilities such as social frailty represent an even greater threat to the health of older adults. However, we know very little about the risk factors and interventions that may prevent or reverse social frailty. Therefore, our research goals are to better understand interventions addressing social frailty in older adults by conducting a systematic review and a realist review. The results of this work will help decision makers understand which social frailty interventions can best address the needs of vulnerable older adults impacted by isolation during COVID-19 or other disease outbreaks requiring similar public health measures.","Monika Kastner, Jayna M Holroyd-Leduc, Jemila Hamid, Ian D Graham, Leigh Hayden, Sarah E Munce, Leigh Hayden, Laure Perrier","North York General Hospital, University of Calgary, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, University of Ottawa, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University Health Network, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University of Toronto"
142,Spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric composition and evolution for an improved understanding of air quality and climate change ( 2014/15-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/23800,"Air quality and climate change are pressing health and environmental issues with growing economic consequences. Both provincial and federal governments have enacted legislation to 1) limit the concentration of human-emitted atmospheric trace gases that affect air quality and 2) reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. The problems of air quality and climate change are connected by 1) common emission sources of trace gases in energy production, transportation, heating and cooking combustion, agriculture and industry, 2) the fact that many gases involved in photochemical smog production, such as volatile organic compounds and ozone, are powerful greenhouse gases themselves, 3) changing chemical reaction rates for smog production due to a changing climate, and 4) changing meteorological conditions affecting the dispersion, transport and washout of air pollution due to a changing climate. This complexity requires the ongoing and expanded acquisition of high-quality data sets of atmospheric composition in order to test and improve the understanding of atmospheric chemical and dynamical processes implemented in forecasting models of air quality, weather and climate.My newly established research program meets this need while addressing one of four strategic research areas of the Government of Canada (“Environmental Science and Technologies”) as well as three programs (""Weather and Environmental Services”, “Climate Change and Clean Air”, “Compliance Promotion and Enforcement – Pollution”) satisfying two strategic outcomes of Environment Canada (Informed decisions on changing weather and climate, Minimizing threats from pollution). It will significantly expand the Halifax and Atlantic Canada measurement capability of atmospheric trace gases relevant to air quality and climate change through the establishment of the Tropospheric Remote Sensing Laboratory at Saint Mary’s University. Using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic techniques the following long-term research goals will be met:1. Characterizing and understanding atmospheric processes, composition, variation, and long-term change;2. Assessing the effectiveness of air quality policies and regulations in the context of long-range (trans-boundary) pollution transport and climate change;3. Assessing the effectiveness of greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in the context of a changing economy;4. Challenging air quality models and satellite observations with precise, accurate, temporally dense and spatially diverse observations of near-surface trace gas concentrations and emissions.In the short-term, continuous and high temporal resolution measurements of a broad suite of volatile organic compounds, ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, carbon monoxide and other trace gases relevant to air quality and the greenhouse effect will be made, characterizing stationary and mobile individual sources (ship plumes, stacks), line emission sources (roads) and diffuse sources (crop fields, fuel wood combustion). These data will be correlated with the Air Quality Health Index public advisory tool as well as information available on morbidity (disease) and mortality rates attributed to poor air quality episodes. The aim of the comparison is to improve the Index, which best serves our most vulnerable populations of children, seniors and the ill. Finally, data gathered will also be used to inform local and regional regulations, such as Air Quality Regulations and Greenhouse Gas Regulations in the Nova Scotia Environment Act. This will help ensure that Canadian governments are enacting reductions in atmospheric pollutants that lead to the greatest health benefits with the smallest economic impacts possible under the circumstances.",Aldona Wiacek,Saint Mary's University
143,Structural and Functional Connectivity in the Dynamic Aging Brain ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/204466,"Rationale: In Canada, the number of individuals over age sixty-five has exceeded the number of children (under age fourteen) for the first time in history. According to Statistics Canada, the number of seniors in Canada could reach 10.9 million by 2036. Given the shift in our relative age distribution, there is currently a crucial need to better understand the changes that occur as individuals age, especially given that the vast majority of cognitive neuroscience research has focused on young adults. Among the most well-known shifts associated with aging are changes in cognitive ability. These changes are considered normal and are to be expected. However, the research to date that has linked cognitive change to underlying brain structure and function, has not conceptualized the brain as a interconnected and dynamic system and it is essential for future research to incorporate advanced measures of structural and functional connectivity. ***Research Program: The overarching goal of my research program is to understand the underlying neural correlates of aging in the human brain using advanced multimodal imaging methods. My NSERC Discovery Grant program will use magnetic resonance imaging based measures of structural and functional connectivity to examine the Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition. Specifically, this research will answer the following questions: How do microstructural characteristics of the brain's connections change with age? Do functional networks become more or less active as we age? How do these changes in structural and functional connectivity relate to cognition? Do certain variables such as sex, stress, or physical activity lead to positive or negative neuroplastic changes in the brain? How do structural and functional connectivity and their relationship with cognition change over time, as we follow one set of individuals through the aging process? ***Taken together, this comprehensive and extremely novel program of research will characterize how the human brain as a dynamic system changes with age. The work will interrogate and advance current theory on aging, and enhance current understanding of our aging population. ********",Jodie Gawryluk,University of Victoria
144,Structure and rheology of mixed hydrocolloid gels as model systems for food 3D printing ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/212617,"In the following, I propose a long-term research program seeking to develop process-structure-property relationships for food additive manufacturing. Food 3D printing finds applications in “digitalized gastronomy”, with the exploration of new shapes, flavors, textures and innovative recipes. However its most interesting focus might be in improving healthcare, where it can adapt food nutritional value, shape and texture to individual needs such as those of elderly people. It requires “premier food rheology expertise” as stated by NASA, who signaled its importance as a technology that could help feeding the crew over long duration missions. My group is a leader in understanding rheological properties of complex fluids, and our recent developments on 3D printing of polysaccharide-based hydrogels represent the perfect expertise to carry out the work proposed in this research program.***The main objective is to deepen our understanding of material behavior in food 3D printing, more specifically in hydrogel-forming extrusion, in order to expand its potential use as a complementary technology for food processing. The research proposed aims at using polysaccharide-protein hydrocolloids as model systems and contribute to the fundamental understanding of their macromolecular assembly. Expected results of this research program include (1) the development of a printability index and (2) the determination of optimal parameters to stabilize the printed structures. It will consider increased complexity of edible inks with combination of polysaccharides (complex carbohydrates), proteins and fibers (insoluble cellulose additives). Finally it will aim at (3) establishing relationships to guide 3D printing of food and develop multiple additive manufacturing methods.***The impact of this research program could be considerable for Canadians, in view of the aging population. For example, printing pureed food-type could help seniors with chewing and swallowing problems (dysphagia) and affected by vitamin deficiencies. Furthermore, printing customized meals for children, expectant mothers or athletes using food ingredients adapted to their individual condition, activity level and personal preferences could contribute to global health and well-being of the Canadian population. On a longer term, as biometric data about individuals become available through blood tests and advanced diagnosis tools, it will become possible to control the vitamins, nutrients, allergens, caloric content and portion size according to daily determined needs and through the automated production of food such as 3D printing. Finally, highly qualified personnel will be trained for the food industry of tomorrow by gaining expertise in 3D printing, rheology, physicochemical characterization, food processing and critical thinking, all qualifications sought by the industry. Results from this research may help Canada to develop this promising emerging technological food market.",MarieClaude Heuzey,Polytechnique Montréal
145,Supporting the creation of a LEARNing INteGrated health system to mobilize context-adapted knowledge with a Wiki platform to Improve the transitions of frail Seniors from from hospitals and emergency Departments to the cOMmunity: the LEARNING WISDOM Phase II scale-up project ( 2017/18-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/153228,"Elderly patients do not always receive the best care to help them return home after being discharged from the hospital. The connections between the hospital and community-care settings are often inadequate. As a result, elderly patients may be repeatedly readmitted to the hospital and their capacity to function may decrease. Caregivers may feel more burdened by the increasing care for their elderly loved ones. As well, healthcare costs increase. Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto developed the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) program to improve healthcare for the elderly. By using innovative strategies such as transition coaches, follow-up calls and patient self-care guides, the ACE program reduced lengths of hospital stay and readmissions for elderly patients, increased patient satisfaction, and saved the healthcare system over $6 million in 2014. In 2016, the Centre integre en sante et en services sociaux de Chaudiere-Appalaches (CISSS CA) received funding from the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement and support from Mount Sinai experts to implement the ACE Program in one hospital in the CISSS CA with a focus on improving transitions between hospital and the community for the elderly. The goal of this research project is to implement the ACE Program in three other hospitals within the CISSS CA, using a ""Wiki-suite"" to help adapt and apply the ACE Program to each hospital.

146,Synapse-type-specific plasticity in neocortical microcircuits ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/20813,"Neuroscientists believe that learning and memory as well as the refinement of neuronal circuits during development are due to changes in synaptic connections among interconnected neurons, known as synaptic plasticity. My team investigates plasticity in neocortex, with a focus on the more recently discovered Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) paradigm, because of its excellent experimental control and biological plausibility. With classical STDP, pre before postsynaptic firing within a few milliseconds results in strengthening, whereas the opposite temporal order elicits weakening, which effectively enables the brain to learn causal relationships. But synaptic plasticity is known to vary with synapse type -- different mechanisms and phenomenology are found at inputs to different interneuronal classes. Why and how does synaptic plasticity vary? In this Discovery Grant proposal, we aim to confront this issue, using a battery of state-of-the-art methods such as paired recordings, 2-photon imaging, optogenetics, and computer modeling. Our unpublished data indicate that some interneuronal cell types possess reversed STDP at their excitatory inputs, while others do not. This synapse type specificity of STDP is not likely to be coincidental, but important for brain functioning. We will use this as a starting point, and trace out the STDP learning rules of key synapse types in developing visual cortex, while carefully classifying these interneurons based on their morphology, intrinsic firing patterns, and genetic markers. This research program will clarify the rules that govern information storage and rewiring during development of the neocortex. Our efforts will produce cutting-edge scientific results, while at the same time being safe. The proposal would enable three graduate students to learn advanced optical and electrophysiological techniques, and an undergraduate to learn imaging, morphological reconstructions, etc., thus providing an ideal setting for training of highly qualified personnel ranging from the junior to the relatively senior.",PerJesper Sjostrom,McGill University
147,System justification: Self-regulatory causes and unintended emotional consequences ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183547,"How do students react when their freedom to select courses is curtailed? How do citizens handle the election of a national leader they despise? In my past SSHRC-funded work, I explored the conditions under which people justify potentially negative aspects of their social systems, and actively reconfigure their preferences to perceive the current status quo in a more positive light. In other words, I have documented conditions under which the students will devalue their freedom, and the citizens will downplay the new leader's flaws---flaws that they previously so readily pointed out. In the current work, I challenge the common framing of system justification, aiming to answer two interrelated questions: a) why do people justify their systems, and b) what are the consequences of system justification for psychological well-being. Most scholars portray system justification as serving a palliative function: Providing emotional reassurances while also having no material benefit, and in fact causing harm to important societal outcomes. For example researchers have shown how system justification quells existential anxieties, but also causes people to accept even patently unjust status quos. My unique background allows me to connect these ideas with work on self-regulation and goal systems, whose literatures highlight how people must manage their pursuit of different goals, since these goals compete for finite resources like money, time and attention. My proposed work casts system justification as a tool for enabling success on personal, non-system-related goals, highlighting its functionality for individuals, and pointing to one of the reasons why it may be so difficult to stamp out. I first test the hypothesis that people justify their systems to economize material resources. Study 1 uses an online sample of adults, manipulating whether people are able to system justify and testing whether those who cannot then feel obligated to spend their money to rectify a negative aspect of the system. Study 2 uses a sample of college students, manipulating their subjective need to conserve their money, and testing whether this manipulation induces increased system justification. I next test the hypothesis that people justify their systems to protect their cognitive resources from rumination. Study 3 measures rationalization of a fictional UBC policy, and tests whether students who justify the policy show better performance on a subsequent cognitive task. Study 4 is a longitudinal survey of a representative sample of Americans surrounding the 2020 presidential election. It tests whether workers who anticipate a need for cognitive resources at work a) justify the newly elected president more, b) ruminate about the election less, and c) perform better at work the following week. Finally I test hypotheses relating to the consequences of system justification for well-being. Two longitudinal studies of college students, in daily life (Study 5) and during exams (Study 6) examine whether calibrating system justification to domains about which one cares is critical in reaping the emotional benefits it can offer, and whether poor calibration instead leads to decrements in well-being, in part due to problems with goal achievement. In addition to the theoretical advances indicated above, the proposed methodology incorporates opportunities for student training including volunteer research assistants, a senior undergraduate to manage them, and two graduate students dedicated to the project. The results from the proposed longitudinal studies and lab experiments, using diverse samples, will be disseminated broadly to provide guidance to the general public, and to policy-makers and activists who seek to promote a more active, less complacent citizenry.",Kristin Laurin,University of British Columbia
148,TEC4Home: Telehealth for Emergency-Community Continuity of Care Connectivity via Home-Telemonitoring ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147501,"Healthcare for seniors can be challenging, especially for those with chronic illnesses like heart failure. Without suitable home care to support them, their health can quickly get worse, resulting in Emergency Room (ER) visits or hospital admissions. By finding a way for doctors and nurses to watch over these seniors at home, we may be able to catch any problems early and help them to avoid getting sick and going to hospitals. This support may even help seniors feel better by being comfortable and safe in their own homes, knowing that doctors and nurses are watching over them. By reducing hospital visits, our health system may save money or offer the hospital beds to other patients. Modern technology allows doctors and nurses to use electronic devices to see how the patient is feeling and measure things like weight, blood pressure, and heart rates, while the patient is at home. In the TEC4Home project, UBC researchers will work with the BC Ministry of Health, TELUS Health, hospital doctors and nurses, and family doctors to use this technology to monitor seniors while they recover at home. This information would be available for patients and their doctors and nurses to view securely online. Hospital and family doctors and nurses will connect with the patients and monitor them electronically to ensure they stay well, especially after ER visits. During this four year project, we will: 1. Make patients feel better and safer about using this technology at home; 2. Help the emergency doctors and the person's family doctor feel good about using this system to watch over the patient; 3. Help the person get better at home without needing to return to the emergency department; 4. Help companies like TELUS Health and Sentrian make their technology better and easier to use; and 5. Save money for the healthcare system.","Craig R Mitton, Kendall Ho, Riyad Baha Abu-Laban, James M Christenson, Nathaniel M Hawkins, Helen J Novak Lauscher, John J Marsden, Panos Nasiopoulos, Hubert H Wong","University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, Vancouver General Hospital, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia"

The EMBOLDEN study aims to promote physical and community mobility (moving around in the community), among people 55 years of age and older living in Hamilton, ON. We will co-design a program to foster positive changes in health, quality of life, and social participation. The City of Hamilton has partnered with the Hamilton Council on Aging (HCoA) and Seniors Advisory Committee (SAC) to establish Hamilton as an Age-Friendly City. The EMBOLDEN study capitalizes on the momentum of these initiatives and brings together researchers, the HCoA, SAC, and other key stakeholders including older adult citizens. A key feature of the EMBOLDEN study is the collaborative approach to co-designing the program and its implementation and evaluation. In a number of Hamilton neighborhoods, there are striking connections between social health determinants and both the health status and access to health resources of residents. Our study will build on existing best practices and local supports to promote health and mobility through physical activity, nutrition support, social support, and strengthening connections with existing service supports. The co-design process will identify strategies to address needs not met by existing services and accessibility barriers older adults face, as well as select one neighbourhood in which to pilot test the EMBOLDEN intervention. This co-design will also result in a protocol for the pilot study. The EMBOLDEN program will be developed such that it can be implemented throughout the City of Hamilton and adapted to other Canadian communities.","Parminder S Raina, Rebecca L Ganann, Stuart M Phillips, Julia Abelson, Terence (Terry) T Flynn, Lehana Thabane, Sarah Neil-Sztramko, Ayse Kuspinar, Kathryn A Fisher, Gina (Ragini Agarwal, Elizabeth Alvarez, James Gillett, .

The team-based project is organized as an ""LGBTQ Oral History Digital Collaboratory."" By ""collaboratory,"" we mean a virtual working space---a cooperative laboratory-- through which team members will come together to share work, ideas, and new knowledge concerning the creation of LGBTQ oral histories in the digital age. The project explores the histories of trans* people, queer women, gay men, and lesbians in the U.S. and Canada through the creation of a virtual research meeting place, the completion of four distinct oral history projects, a digital LGBTQ ""oral history hub,"" and a digital trans archival collections pathfinder. Two of the oral history projects represent original research, while two are semi-orphaned, historical community endeavors that the Collaboratory will preserve, transcribe, and make accessible to a wider audience. The two new oral history projects are (1) the Trans Partner Oral History Project (50 interviews, PI as lead researcher), concerning the histories of partners of trans men in the U.S. and Canada, almost all of whom once identified as lesbian; and (2) the Trans History Oral History Project (30 interviews, PI+A. Devor), focused on the life histories of senior trans activists whose papers are being collected by the Transgender Archives at the University of Victoria. The two older oral history projects are: (1) the Lesbians Make History (LMH) oral history project concerning ""gay women"" in the 1950s and 1960s, collected in the 1980s and early 1990s; 15 interviews, 3 of which need further work; and (2) The Foolscap Oral History Project, a historical, ""orphaned"" project, concerning mostly gay men, 105 interviews completed in the 1980s concerning homophile activism, gay organizations, bar culture, and the drag scene. In addition to these oral history projects, we propose a digital LGBTQ ""oral history hub,"" and a digital trans archival collections pathfinder. Collectively, this research will provide unprecedented historical insight into the lives of lesbians, gay men, queer, and trans people from 1945 to the present in the U.S. and Canada. Our team members are both specialists in LGBTQ history, trans studies, and oral history, as well as key personnel in LGBTQ archives. They are: Prof. Karen Stanworth, representing the Canadian Lesbian and Gay Archives (CLGA); 2) Prof. Aaron Devor, representing the Transgender Archives (TGA) at the University of Victoria; 3) Prof. Elise Chenier, representing the Archive of Lesbian Oral Testimony (A LOT); 4) Prof. K.

152,"The Potential Benefits of Omega Fatty Acid Supplementation on Skeletal Muscle Membrane Composition and Function, and Energy Metabolism in Young and Older Men and Women ( 2015/16-2019/20 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/21171,"It is well known that OMEGA-3 fatty acid (O3FA) supplementation exerts a myriad of positive physiological effects in the human body, including lowered blood lipids and inflammatory indices, improved antithrombotic and cardiovascular indices, and improved cognitive function. The common denominator in all these effects is the ability of O3FAs to modify the properties of membranes and to stimulate gene expression in many tissues. Surprisingly, little work has examined the effects of O3FAs on skeletal muscle. This large organ (~28 kg in a 70 kg person) is important for moving the body throughout our daily activities by using the fuels fat and carbohydrate to generate the necessary energy for movement. Skeletal muscle is also an important storage site for the CHO and lipid that we consume during the day. The capacity of muscle to burn carbohydrate and lipid as fuel is low in sedentary individuals and also decreases as we age and lose muscle mass and become less physically active. The proportion of seniors in Canada is predicted to increase from 13% of the total population in 2005 to 25% in 2036, so this is an important concern. When low physical activity levels are coupled with consuming too much food at any age, and the loss of muscle mass that accompanies aging, there is increased risk for a variety of lifestyle and age-related diseases. The proposed work describes a research program that combines molecular, biochemical, and physiological approaches to comprehensively explain the hypothesized improvements of O3FA supplementation on human skeletal muscle metabolism and function in young and older men and women. The working hypothesis is that O3FA supplementation will increase the resting metabolic rate (RMR) in skeletal muscle and the whole body and will increase the ability of skeletal muscle to burn fat in resting and exercise situations. It may also maintain skeletal muscle mass and whole body lean mass. It is expected that these changes will be most pronounced in older men and women and partially counteract the loss of muscle mass and function, decreased RMR, and decreased ability to use fuel that accompanies aging. The proposed experiments are novel and will directly examine the effects of O3FA supplementation on human skeletal muscle, as the human is the species that we ultimately want to investigate. With a clearer understanding of the mechanisms whereby O3FA supplementation protects/improves skeletal muscle function and the metabolism of fat and carbohydrate in both young and older people, we will be in a better position to understand how it corrects/counteracts the effects of physical inactivity, excess food consumption, and aging. This basic information will help us reduce the incidence of the chronic diseases prevalent in our society.",Lawrence Spriet,University of Guelph
153,The Recruitment and Retention of International High-Skilled Professionals for Innovation and Growth ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187150,"CHALLENGE Canadian and Chinese stakeholders in talent mobility have much to learn from one another. Canada has been an active recruiter of high-skilled migrants for decades. Meanwhile, with Chinese return migrants as a main driving force, China has emerged as a leading innovator; and despite its own talent pools, even China now competes for global talent. While China demonstrates how talent flows can translate into innovation, Canada, with an unparalleled range of policies and programs, can inform the recruitment and retention of talent worldwide, including in China. However, little is known about how companies and technology clusters can recruit, retain, and utilize global talent effectively for stronger innovation and growth. While competition is usually the focus, the interconnectedness of technology clusters, e.g. between Canada and China, through business exchanges and talent flows, is often ignored; as is the question of how companies, clusters and governments could foster, and benefit from a stronger dialogue and collaboration in the management of talent mobility. GOALS AND OBJECTIVES On the basis of our partnered research and active involvement of industries and governments, our partnership will (1) assess how companies in leading technology clusters in Canada and China compete for talent, recruit and retain global talent and utilize existing policies and programs: What practices are successful; what are limiting or advantageous factors of certain pathways; what are impediments for effective recruitment, retention and utilization? On the basis of our assessment, we will (2) identify solutions, and develop actionable advice on how to design and enhance policies and practices for recruiting and retaining talent effectively for innovation and growth. We will (3) mobilize our knowledge and recommendations with target audiences, from the local to the global level. The outputs of our partnership, all in open-access, will consist of cluster profiles, policy and industry recommendations (reports and manuals), scholarly publications, different online-based products, as well as media op-eds, all of which will provide actionable research-based information, practical guidance and policy suggestions. ENGAGEMENT OF PARTNERS This partnership involves academic and private research institutions, important industry intermediaries, and individual experts with unique familiarity and knowledge on talent mobility and innovation -- as top policy advisor, former senior government official, CEO, innovator, leading scholar, in fact even as returnee/global talent -- from Canada, China and beyond. This project addresses a collective need to acquire and disseminate an in-depth understanding of global talent mobility, and how technology clusters and their stakeholders can effectively recruit, retain and utilize talent. The partner organizations will be actively involved throughout the project, closely collaborate and meaningfully participate both in the generation of new knowledge through partnered research in selected Canadian and Chinese technology clusters, as well as in the effective mobilization of findings and actionable recommendations to target audiences, including in industry, government, and also international organizations. Our diversity of partners brings an essential and unparalleled array of expertise in industry practice, policy-making and advocacy, management of migration and academic inquiry to increase the breadth and impact of project activities, i.e. delivering much-needed knowledge and understanding for providing in-depth and actionable insights and recommendations for enhanced policies and practices in Canada, China, and globally.",Martin Geiger,Carleton University

The requested equipment will support the research programs of one senior (Osinski) and three junior (Goda, Molnar, Neish) faculty in the Department of Earth Sciences as well as several others from across campus. As demonstrated by the fact that we have 2 male (Osinski, Goda) and 2 female (Molnar, Neish) applicants, diversity in team composition is, and will continue to be, an intentional consideration in building the expertise of the research team. ******This equipment will enable cutting-edge new research to be conducted, across a broad range of topics, with a focus on the following 4 areas: 1) comparative planetology, periglacial geomorphology, post-disaster earthquake surveys, Precambrian geology, and seismic microzonation. In addition, this equipment will also support research by other faculty members at Western in the areas of archaeology, crop disease detection, hydrology, and mineral exploration. These disparate fields have a common theme which is field science in often remote, inaccessible and/or dangerous environments. Cross-cutting products required by the applicants include digital elevation models (DEMs), high-resolution imagery, and compositional information on surface deposits and rocks.******Once reliant on a “boots on the ground approach”, an increasingly common method is to collect data remotely this epitomizes the rapidly expanding field of remote sensing. Historically, remote sensing has entailed the use of satellite imagery or airborne surveys collected from helicopters and airplanes, which is expensive and difficult to acquire in real-time. Due to recent technological advancements, there has been an explosion of the development and use of small-scale unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or drones. The use of drones will revolutionize data collection for the applicants' field research programs. They will allow for the collection of low-cost data in real-time; quick access to sites where access is hazardous to people and/or wheeled vehicles (e.g., large-scale landslides, cliffs/gorges, blocky lava flows, etc.); and they can be easily transported and used anywhere in the world. In summary, these lightweight portable platforms provide a bird's eye view of a field site in an on-demand, low-cost, remotely deployable platform. The equipment requested here includes fixed-wing drones to enable rapid coverage of large areas, and quadcopters, which have higher lift capacity to carry additional payloads and have increased manoeuvrability for mapping areas at low altitudes. Requested sensors include visible and multispectral cameras, and LiDAR. In addition to representing a paradigm shift in research at Western, the acquisition of this equipment will significantly enhance the quality and extent of training by providing unique new opportunities for students to receive hands-on training in remote sensing.","Gordon Osinski, Sheri Molnar, Katsuichiro Goda, Catherine Neish","Western University, Western University, Western University, Western University"
156,"The cell physiology of innate immunity: signal transduction, ion transport and membrane traffic. ( 2015/16-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147584,"This application represents the synthesis and prospective extension of 3 separate currently funded operating grants. The central theme of the proposed research is the role of innate immunity in health and disease (Fig. 1). The application consists of a fundamental research program, combined with translational studies that will be carried out in collaboration with expert clinician scientists. Phagocytosis and macropinocytosis were selected as the focus of our studies for 2 reasons. First, they play a vital role in the elimination of invading pathogens and apoptotic cells, and are essential for antigen presentation to lymphoid cells. Secondly, they are complex phenomena that encompass receptor-ligand interactions, signal transduction, ionic homeostasis, cytoskeletal remodeling and membrane traffic. As such, they afford an ideal experimental paradigm to study many of the events of greatest interest in modern cell biology.The proposal is rooted in the notion that biomedical sciences, which have experienced a period of enormous progress in genomics and proteomics, are entering an era where systematic integration will be required. Moreover, I believe that a better understanding of physiology and pathophysiology will emerge from studies where spatial and temporal coordinates can be measured precisely in intact cells. In this context, the size and time course of formation of phagosomes/macropinosomes are ideally suited for quantitative analysis using advanced optical methods. The emergence of powerful sub-diffraction microscopy techniques, combined with molecular manipulations to ablate or substitute specific gene products, will enable us to make great progress in understanding innate immunity and other facets of cell and systems physiology in the next decade.We plan to explore concomitantly several related lines of investigation: a) studies of phagocytic receptor engagement and the associated kinetic segregation of kinases and phosphatases; b) the role of Ca2+ and GTPases in the signaling leading to macropinosome and phagosome formation; c) the involvement of phosphoinositides and of iBAR proteins in cytoskeletal remodeling and d) definition of the role of organellar pH and Rab proteins during phagosome/macropinosome maturation. In parallel, we will conduct translational studies in collaboration with Drs. M. Glogauer, R. Rottapel and A. Muise to study diseases involving phagocytic cells, including periodontal inflammation, osteoporosis and inflammatory bowel disease.I believe that we can accomplish the proposed goals, by virtue of the expertise and technical assets accumulated over a 30-year career. My team is endowed with the know-how and equipment to perform advanced imaging (single-molecule detection, super-resolution microscopy) and ancillary optical methods (photoactivation, laser tweezers). Importantly, we are experienced in the isolation, polarization and genetic/molecular manipulation of primary and immortalized myeloid cells.Pursuit of the scientific goals will be coupled to the training and mentoring of graduate students and postdoctoral (Ph.D. and M.D.) fellows. A well-defined strategy, the result of gradual adjustment over many years, is presented to provide intensive teaching and guidance to current and future trainees. My commitment to training and mentorship is attested by the fact that nearly 40 of my former trainees occupy senior research positions in universities and institutes in Canada and around the world.",Sergio Grinstein,Hospital for Sick Children
157,The embedding project: a community of researchers and practitioners improving corporate sustainability performance ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/111442,"The Challenge: The UN has launched its new Sustainable Development Goals and countries are looking to the business sector for innovation and leadership. While an increasing number of senior executives have recognized the need to embed sustainability into their companies' operations and decision-making, most still struggle to do so. A few leading companies have begun to integrate social and environmental factors into their core decision-making and their growing knowledge and experience is ripe for broader application; if it could be effectively harnessed and adapted for more wide-spread use. Our Aim and Vision: The overall goal of this partnership (the Embedding Project) is to facilitate a multidirectional flow of theoretical and practical knowledge among researchers and practitioners by co-creating resources and tools that will help companies embed sustainability across their operations and decision-making. Our vision is that, within 7 years, the Embedding Project will be a globally recognized source of knowledge for organizations seeking to advance their sustainability performance through collective learning grounded in high quality research. Our Approach: The Embedding Project -- through a set of reciprocal and enduring relationships built over a period of five years between leading sustainability researchers; over two dozen of the world's largest companies; educators; and key knowledge mobilization partners -- will facilitate the creation and collection of longitudinal data that document the diversity of corporate responses to embedding sustainability. We will employ two primary methods of engagement, each facilitated by expert researchers: Regional Peer-to-Peer Networks, where companies assess and compare their efforts and engage in structured peer coaching; and Global Communities of Practice, convened on significant topics, where leading companies share and develop best practices and co-create tools and resources. Anticipated Outcomes: We will develop effective processes of peer learning that facilitate the exchange and co-creation of knowledge that will enable us to refine our contributions to theory through the academic publication process and our contributions to practice by developing and piloting tools and resources in real world settings. We will also develop an innovative set of teaching materials for educators, seeking to provide leading edge knowledge on embedding sustainability to the next generation of business leaders. Our knowledge portal will support and facilitate all of these efforts, and provide free access to resources to both academic and practitioner audiences. The partnership will also provide unique opportunities for research involvement and training for an estimated 33 master's students, 7 doctoral students and 6 postdoctoral fellows, enabling them to acquire advanced qualitative research skills as well as experiential learning in bridging research and practice. Our Capability and Viability: Our partnership builds on previous work supported by two SSHRC Partnership Development Grants. Over a period of five years, we have already invested over $900,000 in partnership development activities (with more than half coming directly from companies) to build strong relationships and develop sound structures and processes for the co-creation and mobilization of knowledge. The proposed research agenda for this partnership has been crafted in collaboration with our corporate end-users and is responsive to their evolving needs. Our partnership is designed to ensure that by the end of the 7-year period, the Embedding Project will be financially self-sustaining by delivering value to its members and partners.","Joep Cornelissen, Charlotte Cloutier, Eric Werker, Ralph R Hamann, Jennifer A Howard-Grenville, Jason Jay, None None, None None, None None, None None, None None, None None","Erasmus University, HEC Montréal, Simon Fraser University, University of Cape Town, University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, HEC Montréal, Simon Fraser University, University of Cambridge, Erasmus University, University of Cape Town, Massachusetts Institute of Technology"
158,The evolution of the interior of the Earth and solid planets ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/210898,"My research interest is the thermal evolution of terrestrial planets and specifically planetary mantle and core heat exchange. Convection in planetary mantles is responsible for volcanism, seismicity and orogenesis. It influences a planet's topography and gravitational field, the magnetic field, the formation of mineral deposits and, in Earth's case, drives plate tectonics, continental drift, affects climate and influences cycles of biological evolution. To understand Earth's evolution, it is instructive to study other terrestrial bodies that are composed from the same materials. Rocky bodies throughout the solar system, as well as those detected orbiting more distant stars, provide a long list of puzzling questions: why does the Earth feature plate tectonics while other planets in the solar system do not; could planets elsewhere exhibit plate tectonics; what role does the early history of a planet have in determining whether it will achieve surface mobility; how does interior structure and heterogeneity affect cooling and how do some small moons remain geologically active?******To address these issues I'll work with students and experienced collaborators using models that allow for calculations of the evolution of planetary mantle convection. Due to the very different time scales on which motions in planetary cores evolve versus the convective motion in the mantle, modelling mantle convection is not contingent on modelling core convection. Rather, the most common approach is to treat the core as a rapidly mixing reservoir of heat providing a constant temperature at the base of the mantle. Although this approach is well supported for many modelling studies it implies the modelling of a non-evolving planet, if the system is not able to cool. The research plan described here will feature a focus on investigating the influence of heat loss from the core and transitions in regimes as planetary mantles cool. The related projects will utilize tested open source computing tools and provide short term projects for several M.Sc. and senior undergraduate students.******A more time-demanding aspect of this line of research will be investigations of the effect of mantle compositional heterogeneity on core cooling. A consensus has formed in the past decade that the lower mantle of the Earth shrouds two large seismically distinct provinces situated atop the core-mantle boundary. The nature of these provinces remains contentious but a possible compositional origin is a leading hypothesis. Such a component in the deep mantle would be an important influence on heat flow from the core due to a thermal blanketing effect.

159,The impact of the temporary foreign worker program on the Canadian economy ( 2015/16-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107732,"Since 1973, Canada has had a temporary foreign worker (TFW) program enabling employers to temporarily fill job vacancies with foreign workers where Canadians are unavailable. For nearly four decades the program existed without controversy, falling under the radar of most Canadians. However, in 2012, a number of allegations of abuse began to surface. The media frenzy that ensued revealed that the number of TFWs employed in Canada more than tripled between 2002 and 2010, driven in large part by a 2002 government decision to expand the program to a larger set of unskilled occupations. The government responded in April 2013, and again in June 2014, by introducing a number of measures curtailing the program, including increasing the cost and rigor of the labour market test used to determine if labour shortages are genuine, restricting TFWs to comprise no more than 10% of workforces, and refusing to process applications where unemployment rates exceed 6%. Recent data reveal a significant reduction in permits issued, leading corporate Canada to argue that the policy pendulum has swung too far in the opposite direction. In a panel discussion at the Conference Board of Canada's 2015 Immigration Summit, senior vice president of the Canadian Chamber of Commerce, Warren Everson, argued that the government's reaction is putting the economy at risk. Despite the government's strong policy reaction, we know remarkably little about what the impact of the TFW program is on the Canadian economy. The dearth of compelling evidence reflects, in large part, an absence of disaggregated data that would allow researchers to compare economic conditions between local markets that have experienced varying degrees of exposure to TFWs. Our project aims to fill this void. Through an agreement with Citizenship and Immigration Canada (CIC), the research team on this project has been provided with an administrative data file containing the number of temporary work permits issued within particular occupations and cities in every quarter between 1980 and 2014, as well as the stock of TFWs on December 31 of each year. Our research project has three main objectives. First, we will examine the impact of TFWs on the labour market outcomes of domestic workers employed or seeking employment in common labour markets. This will be done by linking Labour Force Survey (LFS) data on wages and unemployment rates at the level of particular city-occupation labour markets to our CIC data. Second, we will exploit data from the COMPUSTAT database to obtain evidence of the impact of TFWs on profits of Canadian corporations. Finally, we will address a concern that increased TFW inflows have crowded out permanent immigration, particularly through provincial nominee programs, which like the TFW program, are primarily driven by employer demand for labour. To examine to what extent this may be happening, we will, once again, relate changes in the exposure of particular local labour markets to permanent immigration inflows of workers who intend to work in the same markets. The current and widespread perception that the TFW program has had adverse effects on Canadians appears largely based on reports of above-average unemployment rates in regions where unskilled TFWs are employed. However, such correlations are not evidence of causal impacts, since they tell us nothing about what unemployment rates would be in the absence of TFWs. Using new data on the exposure of local labour markets to TFWs, our research will provide the government with much-needed analytical insights, enabling it to make future policy decisions that strike the right balance between the needs of Canadian employers and labour market opportunities for Canadian workers.","Mikal Skuterud, David A Green, Craig W Riddell","University of Waterloo, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia"
160,The preservation of identity: Understanding the technology adoption patterns of older adults with age-related vision loss (ARVL) ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112720,"For seniors with age-related vision loss (ARVL), the use of technology has the potential to enhance safety; promote social and community involvement; increase independence; enhance feelings of self-confidence, wellbeing, and a sense of control; and enhance the performance of everyday activities such as reading, shopping, writing, or cooking. Despite the availability of technologies to support vision loss, and the documented benefits, many older adults either never adopt technologies or abandon them shortly after acquisition. This is partly explained by the fact that technology developers often create technologies for older adults without involving them in the design, development, or marketing/commercialization process. What results, are technologies that do not match the personal and social identity that older adults desire to portray; an identity consistent with contemporary discourses of 'positive' or 'successful' aging. Consequently, the technologies are often not used. The importance of self-image in the technology decision-making processes of older adults has been suggested in the literature, but not fully explored. As such, this study will focus on how the decision-making processes of older adults with ARVL, as they relate to technology adoption, is influenced by the negotiation of identity; that is, how older adults' decisions are shaped in relation to broader societal discourses regarding the ideal aging identity and a personal desire to convey the self in particular ways (i.e. as independent, competent, and self-reliant). The proposed study will utilize novel methods for eliciting the lived experiences of up to twelve older people aging with vision loss. Given the scarcity of research focused on self-image, the proposed study will make an important substantive contribution to this limited, albeit growing, body of literature. Through plain language summaries, open-access publications, conference proceedings, a knowledge mobilization forum, and social media access, the study's cutting-edge contributions will be communicated broadly to all key stakeholders including older adults, formal and informal caregivers, low vision service providers, industry and infrastructure markets, and researchers. As groundwork for future studies, this research will begin to map out the complexity of decision-making processes of older adults with ARVL, and place this process within contemporary power relations and discourses of aging that are predicated on ageist and ableist assumptions. In turn, it is anticipated that such research will better support the acquisition and use of technology by older adults with ARVL, as well as promote continued social participation. For example, if technologies can be developed in a manner that is congruent with older adults' desired personal identity, they are more likely to be selected, accepted, and used in daily life, resulting in increased wellbeing, social participation, and activity engagement. Another potential contribution of the proposed research relates to the enhanced design of appropriate (i.e. non-stigmatizing) services and technologies for an aging market. For example, the study findings will help industry to capitalize on an aging market by designing useable technologies that meet the needs, values, preferences, and desired self-image of older adults with vision loss. The study findings will also help to inform inclusive policies and practices to ensure the equitable distribution and availability of appropriate and affordable technologies to all older adults with vision loss. Lastly the proposed study will make valuable methodological contributions. Using novel methods that address both public and private spheres of technology use, this critical ethnographic study will help us to understand decision making-processes from the perspective of older adults with ARVL, but also how decision making is influenced by broader ageist and ableist social assumptions.","Colleen McGrath, Arlene Astell, Deborah Laliberte Rudman","Western University, University of Toronto, Western University"
161,The role of internal audit reports in public sector risk management ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183389,"This project will explore the relationship between internal auditing and risk management in the public sector. In particular, it will analyze how internal audit reports contribute to the identification, understanding, and management of risks in the Canadian Public Service. Our main objectives are to: (1) track systematically the evolution of risk-related discourse in the internal audit reports of the Canadian federal government since 2000; (2) develop an understanding of how senior managers use internal audit reports in the management of risks; and (3) explore how internal auditors perceive the use of internal audit reports as a tool of risk-management under open government. To meet these objectives, we will use mixed methods, drawing on data at the product (audit reports), consumer (interviews of senior executives) and producer (survey of internal auditors) levels of audit work. As a tool of self-regulation, internal audit reports should have an impact on how the organization manages its operational risks. On the one hand, effective use of reports should lead an organization to better understand its risks and adopt controls that provide an adequate measure of assurance against waste, corruption, and operational failures without unduly stifling operations or killing innovation. On the other hand, by promoting excessive or poorly-designed controls and/or a stifling conception of risk, audit reports could also hamper performance and encourage excessive risk aversion. Existing research has little to say on how internal audit reports have impacted risk-management in the public sector nor how recent intensification of disclosure requirements have changed things. At a time when aversion to risk, excessive bureaucratic controls, and inadequate accountability are considered important barriers to improving the performance of the public sector, a better understanding of this relationship will help both practitioners and researchers. We will be the first to examine the corpus of data contained in over 3300 internal audit reports from 73 federal organizations between 2003 and 2018. We will do so by using a text-mining tool specifically tailored for large databases. Content analysis followed by relational and spatial analysis of themes and context will enable us to track the evolution of the 'risk' discourse through time and across parts of government. We will also see the impact (if any) of changes in public disclosure requirements put in place over that period. These analyses will be complemented by semi-structured interviews with around 50 senior executives and by an online structured survey of public sector internal auditors (n=600). The interviews will provide insights as to how the reports are used in the management of risks. These will be recorded and transcribed for open and axial coding. The survey data will be processed using regression analyses to gain quantitative insights into the diversity of opinions with regards to the use and usefulness of internal audit reports and their potential vulnerability to open government policies. Project results will inform discussions on the role and value of internal audit reports in the public sector as well as on potential solutions to excessive risk aversion and the concurrent need to improve risk management practices in the Canadian public sector. They will also encourage debate surrounding the potential unintended consequences of open government policies. This will contribute to the academic literature on public sector accountability, and provide sought-after insights to internal audit practitioners, senior executives, department audit committee members, and the global professional association (Institute of Internal Auditors) that designs internal audit training and accreditations.","Catherine Liston-Heyes, Luc Juillet","University of Ottawa, University of Ottawa"
162,The transversality hub: towards a new mode of learning for community arts practice ( 2015/16-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107758,"Investigating the impact of community arts education and programming (CAEP) is significant at this juncture since the arts are increasingly recognized as potential inputs for social innovation that can fuel progress and transform cultures. However, a multifocal perspective with a fresh look at the functional relationships between the arts and life is needed to challenge the mainstream portrayal of the unquestioned presumption that art is good for you. There is a danger that our inability to move beyond this advocacy agenda will cause the arts to become formulaic and lose their potential for imagining and producing more sustainable and cohesive forms of living. Public debates about the arts thus call for urgent inquiry into the role that artistic practice plays in our communities and how it might improve our lived experiences in an era of rapid technological and socioeconomic change. In response to these challenges, the Transversality Hub is a three-year research project examining the relationships between community and the arts. It identifies points of intersection between horizontal flows of dialogue among community members in two culturally dynamic urban environments of Vancouver and Montreal and vertical modes of exchange within the university-community partnerships at UBC and Concordia. Through a mixed-method approach of case study, visual ethnographic methods, and archival methods, this research investigates the role of community as a space of knowledge production, as well as how the arts help produce such a space as an integral part of community arts practice. The research objectives are to: (1) examine to what extent community as knowledge space is organized and produced through engagement with the arts; (2) develop and mobilize a community resource toolkit of sustainable arts practices; (3) facilitate various modes of knowledge exchanges by developing an alliance of community arts education practice and scholarship. This research situates two prominent Art Education programs at UBC and Concordia as localized research nodes that interconnect with four community field sites (Arts Intervention Program at the Vancouver Police Foundation; Youth Media Program at the Frog Hollow Neighbourhood House in Vancouver; Concordia Seniors Community Arts Program; The Visual Arts Centre in Montreal). The Transversality Hub is a milieu for forming transverse connections that bring forth alternative ways of understanding how the arts might facilitate and provoke critical interfaces in the areas of community development and social economy. It will engage academics, community activists and policy makers to link ideas and action through multimodal representations within collaborative knowledge exchanges. It builds on strengths of our ongoing university-community partnerships to foreground the spatiality of community arts practice through multimedia works (e.g., a website, archival mapping, visualization, and digital storytelling), scholarly publications, community showcases, and a workshop-forum. The Transversality Hub will make three significant contributions. (1) It will create multi-layered intellectual exchanges and intergenerational dialogue about how social institutions can embrace innovative models of teaching and learning. (2) It will offer insights into how community arts practice strengthens social dynamics of innovation and generates learning outcomes that are sustainable. (3) It will provide recommendations for ways of envisioning community as the space of knowledge production where artful social innovations and pedagogical relations can be re-imagined.","Ching-Chiu Lin, Rita L Irwin, Peter P Grimmett, Ching-Chiu Lin, Anita E Sinner","University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, Concordia University"
163,Theory and Analysis of Cosmic Web Observables ( 2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/210618,"This research will develop theoretical frameworks and analysis tools for the tremendous outpouring of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Large Scale Structure (LSS) and galaxy formation data that will arise over 2019-2024 period, and beyond. The 2012-18 period has been amazing, solidifying a Standard Model of Cosmology (SMc) dominated by dark energy and dark matter at high precision, in large part through our activities on the Planck CMB satellite team and the higher resolution Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) team. The impact was recently recognized by the 2018 Gruber Prize in Cosmology to our Planck group for providing “the definitive description of the universe on the largest and smallest scales.” ***CMB and LSS: This proposal emphasizes planned work on Advanced ACTPol and the Simons Observatory follow-on, the related CCATprime telescope, a second flight of the balloon-borne Spider experiment, cross-correlation work of the CMB with the LSS space experiment Euclid and other ground-based LSS surveys, and various three-dimensional line intensity mapping (LIM) experiments probing galaxy formation and assembly. A primary motivation is to find new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology (BSMc). BSMc projects include how to measure whether dark energy is coupled to matter, whether quantum aspects of dark matter are observable, and to create statistical tests for novel non-Gaussian primordial structures generated in the early Universe. ***Gravity Waves and Interstellar Dust Polarization: A major CMB target is to discover early-Universe gravity waves with CMB polarization. The greatest challenge is separating polarized Galactic emissions from what is truly primordial. For this we are developing novel re-mapping measures of anisotropy in the “Milky Way's interstellar web” polarized emissions. ***Line Intensity Mapping is an emerging technique to map large cosmological volumes to probe the Epoch of Galaxy Assembly and even of the pre-galactic cosmic dawn. The Canadian CHIME radio telescope targeting the 21cm line of hydrogen and COMAP in California, targeting a carbon monoxide line, are now taking data, and CCATprime, targeting ionized carbon, is under construction. Our group at CITA is engaging in all of the analytical and theoretical challenges that will arise from these vast new data sources, including any new BSMc physics that might emerge. ***Theory and Simulations: We will create ensembles of rapidly-computable yet accurate SMc and BSMc mock simulations we call webskys for cross-analyses, since all of these big-sky experiments are entangled in one fully correlated light-cone, and must ultimately be analyzed together. This is a challenge because of complex gas processes, but the webskys we construct will learn from the highest resolution gasdynamical feedback simulations. ***HQP: Such work has been and is well suited for engagement of HQP locally at all levels at CITA: Senior RAs and postdocs, graduate and undergraduate research students.",Richard Bond,University of Toronto
164,Thirdworldist genealogies: an alternative history of global film festivals ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110276,"Over the past decades North American academy has been moving away from the predominance of Eurocentric narratives traditionally constituting the core of our disciplines, to a broader and more inclusive notion of both history and theory. One of the ways to address the challenge of de-Westernizing film studies has been to reconstruct the complex international circuits and global flows of film culture, further foregrounding the geopolitical issues which impacted the global history of the 20th century such as the legacies of colonialism, post-colonial struggles, Cold War bids for the spheres of influence and the divisions and alliances they engendered. Despite this interest in transnational approaches, however, very little work has been done on mapping the relationship between the Soviet bloc and the post-colonial Global South within cultural history in general and cinema in particular. My projects seeks to construct a divergent historical and cultural/political genealogy of film festivals by centering it on the developments in Africa, Latin America and Asia and their relationship to the Socialist bloc from 1950s through the 1980s. At the core of my analysis is the way that the two geopolitical frameworks prevalent at that time -- the logic and rhetoric of the Cold War, and the Non-Aligned Movement/Thirdworldism -- intersected and shaped these film festival sites, the cultural transmissions, and the broader circulatory networked they enabled. I will single out three clusters:1) European film festivals which served as springboard for the exchange and circulation among the Thirdworldist cineastes; 2) film festivals taking place in the Soviet bloc which had Asia, Africa and Latin America as their focus, and 3) film festivals and meetings which had an explicitly Thirdwordist agenda. Their shared history offers a rich counterpoint to our contemporary understanding of the dynamics of transnational exchange as inevitably tied to global capital. Viewed in retrospect, these festivals and meetings put into relief the often conflicting ideological agendas and geopolitical formations that typify the global film festival phenomenon of the Cold War era, as well as prefigure some of the more contemporary developments on the world film festival scene whose center is gradually shifting beyond Europe. I will base my research on both published and unpublished materials in several languages held in archives around the world. I plan to disseminate my research through Open Access Publishing (OAPEN and SPECTRUM) and an interactive website as appropriate for the project which seeks to engage audiences and solicit response from the geographic areas it addresses (where scholarly publications from North America are not always easily accessible), thereby changing in its mode of distribution the very Eurocentric practices it seeks to critique. As such, it will contribute to the development of collaborative methods of research, shape new scholarly networks internationally and bolster professional development of the many young researchers participating in it. The emphasis on student training and team work will allow students to directly participate in a long-term project which requires careful organization, openness to new and diverse sources and ideas, collaborative effort, and both patience and flexibility - all the qualities which mark serious intellectual scholarly work and active professional engagement. Course work does not provide the structure necessary for students to acquire these skills, often leaving students to work on a thesis without a first-hand knowledge of the scholarly process and creative engagement with more senior scholars. I am confident that their participation in this project will address this problem.","Masha Salazkina, Maria M Salazkina","Concordia University, Concordia University"
165,Toward a realistic theory of leader effectiveness ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183567,"Effective leaders, especially at the strategic level, are critical to an organization's success and a society's prosperity. Thus, the question of what makes effective leaders is central to strategic leadership research (i.e., research about senior leaders, Finkelstein, Hambrick, and Cannella, 2009). On one hand, the leadership literature has largely presented an idealistic view (Pfeffer, 2010), lauding such virtuous leadership qualities as transformational (Bass, 1985, 1998), authentic (Avolio and Gardner, 2005), humble (Collins, 2001), servant (Greenleaf, 1977), transcendent (Crossan, Vera, and Nanjad, 2008), and good character (Crossan et al., 2017) and equating these qualities with effective leadership. On the other hand, a Machiavellian view (Machiavelli, 1966; Wilson, Near, and Miller, 1996) has long existed and endured, arguing that the use of illegitimate means such as deception, manipulation, and intimidation is necessary for effective leadership (Bailey, 1988; Pfeffer, 2010). Whereas the idealistic view has been criticized as naïve and deceitful, the Machiavellian view as cynical and wrong. In the proposed research, we seek to reconcile the idealistic and Machiavellian views and thereby develop a more realistic theory of leader effectiveness. From a paradox perspective (Li et al., 2012; Smith and Lewis, 2011), legitimate and illegitimate means are contradictory yet interrelated elements that inevitably coexist. What distinguishes virtuous from Machiavellian leaders is not whether, but the extent to which, they rely on illegitimate means (with the former to a very limited extent and the latter to a much greater extent). We argue that whereas the idealistic view is more applicable in a high-integrity context (defined as a context that is highly effective in enforcing the prescribed social norms---encouraging and rewarding legitimate behaviors and, in particular, detecting and penalizing illegitimate behaviors), the Machiavellian view in a low-integrity context. Thus, we propose that whereas virtuous leaders tend to be more effective in a high-integrity context, Machiavellian leaders in a low-integrity context (P1). Relatedly, we propose that whereas virtuous leaders are more prevalent in a high-integrity context than in a low-integrity context, Machiavellian leaders in a low-integrity context than in a high-integrity context (P2). Furthermore, we propose that key stakeholders (e.g., corporate directors who select CEOs and voters who elect political leaders) tend to prioritize perceived leader effectiveness (as assessed based on select measures such as financials) over norm-following (e.g., prefer Machiavellian yet more effective leaders over virtuous yet less effective leaders) (P3a) and especially so in a low-integrity context (P3b). We have developed the above tentative propositions based on our literature review and some preliminary case studies of well-known leaders. In the proposed research, we address these propositions with in-depth case studies (Eisenhardt, 1989; Yin, 1994) based on published data sources (e.g., biographies, memoirs, press coverage, and academic studies). We also plan to complement our case studies by conducting interviews and focus groups with practicing leaders for their insights and feedback on the theory developed. We believe the proposed research, extended from our enduring interest in strategic leadership (e.g., Crossan et al., 2017; Crossan et al., 2008; Tang and Crossan, 2017; Tang, Crossan, and Rowe, 2011, 2018), can enhance our understanding of leader effectiveness. In particular, it may spur the development of robust institutions to foster high-integrity contexts that encourage legitimate, and discourage illegitimate, leadership behaviors, thereby ultimately enhancing the common good.","Jianyun Tang, Mary M Crossan","Memorial University of Newfoundland, Western University"
166,Training cognition to improve mobility and listening in older adults with hearing loss: Moving from lab to life ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/214556,"Older adults with hearing loss walk more slowly and have a greater risk of falls compared to normal-hearing individuals of the same age. Other work suggests that this relationship is influenced by one's cognitive capacity, which compensates for both auditory and mobility decline in old age. Therefore, we aim to train cognition to expand such compensatory capacity. Based on our preliminary work, we anticipate training-related improvements in listening and mobility, particularly under complex conditions such as listening while walking. We will also include standard tests of cognition, hearing, and mobility, to assess the extent to which our training program affects each component of functioning separately. To address early hearing loss, we will include middle-aged adults, healthy older adults, and those with hearing impairment. Our outcome measures will include cutting-edge mobile neuroimaging equipment to assess the brain changes that arise from training. We will also simulate everyday listening activities using virtual reality technology, and measure the impact of training on self-reported ease of listening and on performing other everyday tasks. Overall, this project will potentially offer a novel approach to standard audiological rehabilitation practices (e.g., hearing aid adoption, adjustments to one's environment). As well, cognitive training might be a feasible early intervention for those who are not ready for hearing aids, but who have difficulty in challenging listening situations (e.g., hearing in noisy environments). In general, preventive practices that improve mobility, independence, and reduce the risk of falling have potentially important implications for the health care resources devoted to emergency and follow-up care of Canadian seniors.","Margaret K Pichora-Fuller, Karen Zown-Hua Li, Walter Wittich, Jennifer L Campos, Natalie A Phillips, Louis Bherer, Nancy St-Onge, Jean-Pierre Gagne","University of Toronto, Concordia University, University of Montreal, University Health Network, Concordia University, Montreal Heart Institute, Concordia University, University of Montreal"
168,Transport of magma and gas from the mantle to the atmosphere by volcanic eruptions ( 2014/15-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/21397,"This proposal comprises six distinct projects which are linked intellectually and also in time and space. The overarching objective of this research program is to understand explosive volcanism as it is expressed in magmas and gases which transit from the mantle through the crust to the surface and atmosphere. As such, I take a general “bottom-to-top” approach within this proposal, illustrating how specific key problems can be addressed and answered within the individual research projects.Part 1 of the proposal addresses the transport, storage, and evolution of magmas from mantle depths through the crust to the surface. Particular attention is paid to distinct batches of magmas, how and where they are stored in crustal reservoirs, and the means and timing by which the different batches interact prior to and during volcanic eruptions. I will examine both small systems (Hekla in Iceland and Cerro Negro in Nicaragua) as well as larger caldera systems.Complementary to the first part of the proposal, Part 2 examines the isotopic evolution of volcanic gas from the mantle to the surface. These will be the first such isotopic measurements of their kind. The first component of the research will examine the carbon isotopic character of volcanic gas in plumes of actively degassing volcanoes. The second component will study carbon and hydrogen isotopes in melt inclusions to gain insight into isotopic gas signature of gas at deeper levels beneath a volcano.Part 3 will study the atmospheric and environmental effects and impacts of volcanic gas emissions using two new approaches. First, the bromine, iodine, and chlorine budget of caldera supervolcanoes will be calculated, to estimate the amount of these volatile species released during large explosive eruptions which may serve to deplete stratospheric ozone. Second, the sulfur isotopic signature of tree rings impacted by volcanic degassing will be used to identify periods of activity and quiescence at volcanoes. Such isotopic tree ring records offer a new means of identifying and dating activity at volcanoes which reactivate periodically. A total of 3 PhD students, 3 MSc students, 10 BSc students, and 1 postdoctoral student will be trained during the course of this 5-year research program. My mentoring philosophy is to ensure that the more junior students are mentored and trained by myself and the more senior students, in particular the postdoc and advanced PhD students.This research will contribute to my long-term goals which are a broad understanding of magma and volatile behaviour prior to and during eruptions. The knowledge gained will improve our ability to forecast volcanic eruptions.",John Stix,McGill University

170,"Understanding how vulnerable older adults (are new immigrants, Indigenous, have mild-to-moderate dementia or identify as LGBTQ) experience social isolation and loneliness ( 2019/20-2020/21 )",https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215737,"In Canada, the frailty in seniors is almost twice that of mid-age adults. Frailty has traditionally been conceptualized as a clinical phenomenon, but a person's social activities, social supports, social networks, loneliness and whether they are living alone contributes substantially to social frailty. Frailty is a public health concern as it has been shown to lead to mortality and disability and decreased quality of life. In Canada, seniors who are new immigrants, are Indigenous, have language barriers and/or identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer (LGBTQ) are at even greater risk to become socially isolated or lonely. However, we don't really understand the health risks and challenges of older adults who are socially frail. One reason for this may be that we don't always involve seniors in research, particularly those who are truly representative of the health condition being studied. Patients in general don't tend to drive research initiatives or not involved at all stages of research. However, their insights are the most valuable to understand their lived experience. Our research will address these challenges through a qualitative study of interviews to help us to understand what seniors need to be able to engage in research. We will also investigate how to engage them in research by evaluating how they experience participation in patient-oriented research training as well as in our integrated KT team.","Monika Kastner, Sharon E Straus, Alexandra Papaioannou, Ian D Graham, Leigh Hayden, Sarah E Munce, Leigh Hayden, Barbara Liu, Jamie C Brehaut, Michelle Greiver, Braden O'Neill","North York General Hospital, University of Toronto, McMaster University, University of Ottawa, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University Health Network, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University of Toronto, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Toronto, University of Toronto"
171,Understanding the effectiveness and underlying mechanisms of interventions for socially frailty older adults: A systematic review alongside a realist review ( 2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231284,"By the year 2050, two billion people worldwide will be 60 years of age and older. Global life expectancies are also on the rise, leading to an increased number of seniors who will develop chronic conditions and frailty. Given these projections, frailty is fast becoming a public health concern. Frailty is multidimensional (it affects biological, psychological, and social processes of a person's life), and therefore can lead to reduced functional ability, falls, disability, decreased quality of life, and death. Of the three types of frailty (physical, psychological, and social), social frailty is the least well understood. It is defined as ""a continuum of being at risk of losing, or having lost, social and general resources, activities or abilities that are important for fulfilling one or more basic social needs during the life span"". Although common among seniors, social frailty can be improved, reversed, and prevented, and therefore doesn't have to be considered as an inevitable part of aging. However, we know very little about the risk factors and interventions that may prevent or reverse social frailty. Therefore, our research goals are to better understand interventions addressing social frailty in older adults by conducting a systematic review and a realist review. The results of this work will help us to build a future intervention to prevent or lessen the negative consequences of social frailty affecting seniors.","Monika Kastner, Sharon E Straus, Jayna M Holroyd-Leduc, Wanrudee Isaranuwatchai, Alexandra Papaioannou, Ian D Graham, Leigh Hayden, Sarah E Munce, Leigh Hayden, Barbara Liu, Jamie C Brehaut, Michelle Greiver, Laure Perrier","North York General Hospital, University of Toronto, University of Calgary, St. Michael's Hospital, McMaster University, University of Ottawa, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University Health Network, Sheridan College Institute of Technology and Advanced Learning, University of Toronto, Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, University of Toronto, University of Toronto"
172,Understanding the experience of age prejudice ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109954,"Canada is a nation that is aging, with the number of people aged 65+ increasing at a rate that is almost three times faster than the rate for people aged 64 and younger (Statistics Canada, 2012). Despite this tremendous growth in the number of Canadian seniors, surprisingly little is known about their everyday experiences, especially in terms of the degree to which they face age-based prejudice. Whereas a rich literature exists on younger people's attitudes and stereotypes of older people (e.g., Chasteen et al., 2002; Hummert et al., 1994), there is very little information on older people's prejudice experiences and how they deal with them. The proposed research addresses this crucial gap by focusing on three objectives. The first is to provide a detailed picture of older Canadians' experiences of ageism in their everyday lives. Only a handful of studies have examined older adults' experiences of ageism, with all of them relying on retrospective reports (e.g., Palmore, 2004) and none capturing daily experiences of ageism. As a result, both the immediate and longer-term impact of ageism experiences on older adults' well-being remains unknown. I will address this critical deficit by conducting a daily diary study in Year 1 to document older Canadians' ageism experiences, how they cope with them, and the impact of those experiences on their well-being (Study 1). This research will be the first to reveal the frequency, severity, and short- and longer-term effects of the age prejudice that seniors face in their daily lives. The second objective of my proposal is identify processes that differentiate older adults who are resilient in the face of ageism from those who are not. Specifically, I will determine how individual differences in older adults' sensitivity to age-based rejection affects their response to ageism, which will provide the research foundation needed to design programs to inoculate older people against the most damaging effects of ageism. In both the diary study and later laboratory studies (Studies 1-3), I will identify the different coping strategies that high and low sensitive older adults use when they encounter ageism. In addition, I will investigate whether high and low sensitive seniors exhibit different cognitive (Study 2) and physiological (Study 3) responses to age prejudice. This multi-method approach will be the first to provide a precise account of how older Canadians cope with ageism, thereby expanding theoretical models of coping with stigma to a variety of social contexts and to a stigmatized group that has been overlooked. My final objective for the proposed work is to test the efficacy of different strategies for helping those older adults who are most vulnerable to ageism to cope better. In Study 4 I will assess whether focusing on a group identity or an individual one is a more effective response to age-based rejection. In Study 5 I will test whether confronting ageism when it occurs might increase highly sensitive seniors' feelings of self-efficacy and well-being. Taken together, the knowledge gained from these studies would be invaluable for developing and targeting interventions at those seniors who are most vulnerable to the damaging effects of age prejudice. By meeting these three research objectives, the proposed research will be the first to provide a rich understanding of the age prejudice older Canadians face in their day-to-day lives as well as how they might be able to better cope with the ageism they encounter. As such, findings from this work can be used by researchers, educators, policymakers, and clinicians to develop programs and policies aimed at reducing ageism and providing ways for the growing number of Canadian seniors to deal with age prejudice.",Alison L Chasteen,University of Toronto
173,Understanding the influence of organizations on child welfare service delivery ( 2015/16-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107802,"Maltreatment in childhood can be devastating for individual children and families and society as a whole. Canadian child welfare organizations have experienced an increase in reports of child abuse and neglect in recent years. In addition to varying over time, rates and characteristics of investigated maltreatment vary both within and between provinces/territories across Canada. A key consideration when understanding variations in the rate and characteristics of investigated child maltreatment is the child welfare organization. The potential influence of organizational factors on child welfare decision making, and in turn, outcomes for vulnerable children and families remains largely absent from child welfare practice. The proposed research project will begin to address this gap through a multi-phase research initiative. The overall goal of the research is to develop a theoretical framework through a multi-faceted approach that will provide a strong foundation for child welfare administrators and researchers to test the relationship of organizational characteristics to service decisions and their outcomes. In the first phase of the proposed research, a scoping review of the child welfare literature as well as other relevant human service literature will be conducted, focusing specifically on the potential contribution of organizational factors at key service dispositions (e.g., investigation, intervention, and placement). These findings will be used to inform secondary data analyses with representative provincial data collected by the research team that contain information about the organization and the clinical characteristics of a child maltreatment related investigation. Summaries of the scoping review and the results of secondary analyses will be condensed into Information Sheets available to the Canadian child welfare community through the Canadian Child Welfare Research Portal. The materials will also inform the second and third phases of the project. In the second phase, senior child welfare administrators will act as key informants, and will be interviewed and shadowed to examine how the characteristics of the organization (e.g., specific elements of organizational structure, human resources, and culture) influence decision-making. In order to address the diversity of child welfare systems across Canada, data collection will be conducted in three provinces with distinct service delivery systems: Alberta, Ontario and Quebec. At least five agencies in each province will be included in the sample, and at least one additional First Nations agency per province will be included for a total sample of approximately 18 to 20 agencies. Interviews will be recorded and transcribed verbatim; shadowing will be recorded using data gatherer notes; all data will be coded. The third phase of the project will involve the creation of a theoretical framework articulating key organizational indicators. The framework will incorporate information gathered through the first two phases. In addition to circulating the analysis and draft framework to key informants, a meeting will be held with senior child welfare administrators who did not participate in the interviews to discuss and help synthesize the research findings. The final document will reflect knowledge gained through all phases of the research, and will describe the analysis and theoretical framework. This document as well as the Information Sheets will be disseminated on the Canadian Child Welfare Research Portal which had 109,656 visits and 277,249 page views between March 2014 and February 2015.","Barbara A Fallon, Micheal L Shier, Bruce J MacLaurin, Nico Trocmé, Cindy Blackstock","University of Toronto, University of Toronto, University of Calgary, McGill University, University of Alberta"
174,Understanding the psychology of saving-behavior to help citizens reach financial security ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113448,"` Under-saving (i.e., failing to set aside money for future use) is on the rise. In Ontario, for instance, the number of employees enrolled in a workplace pension-plan is steadily waning while personal savings have been decreasing for 30 years (Province of Ontario 2014). For Canada as a whole, the household savings-rate plummeted from its peak of 20% in the 1980s to merely 3.8% in 2012 (Certified General Accountants Association of Canada 2013). The consequences of under-saving are frightful. Consider the following examples. Poverty. In Canada, the proportion of seniors falling into poverty upon retirement is 12% (~600k people). Those living alone are particularly hard pressed, with 1/4 single seniors (most of whom are women) now in poverty (Statistics Canada 2014a). Similarly, in the United States, because of under-saving during their working years, the poverty rate of the elderly reaches 18% (Wimer & Manfield 2015). Homelessness. From 2007 to 2011, the percentage of older homeowners who were ""seriously delinquent"" (at least 90 days late) in paying their mortgage increased fivefold. In absolute terms, 625k consumers over the age of 50 were seriously delinquent while an additional 600k were already in foreclosure proceedings (Trawinski 2012). By 2050, homelessness among the elderly is projected to double (Sermons & Henry 2010). Similar trends emerge in Australia, where 1/7 people aged 55+ are experiencing homelessness (Australian Bureau of Statistics 2011). Scope of the Present Research Given the prevalence and dire consequences of under-saving for individual as well as societal welfare, this research proposes to examine the psychology of saving behavior. Our goal is to identify some of the invisible forces shaping saving decisions and understand how they interact on saving behavior. Ultimately, we aim to contribute not only to the academic literature (cf. section to this effect) but also to society at large by outlining clear, actionable recommendations for consumers and policymakers. Though many factors affect saving decisions, our main hypotheses can be summarized as follows. First, we posit that money's physical form can influence people's propensity to save. That is, even after controlling for socio-economic particulars, we submit that individuals operating primarily with ""hard cash"" are less likely to seize saving opportunities extended to them than counterparts operating primarily with ""soft/dematerialized"" money (e.g., bank cards, e-wallets). Second, we posit certain personality traits predispose certain people to suffer more from the biasing effects of money format on saving behavior. Prevention focus (concerns for safety, responsibility, security) is the personality dimension we believe has the largest influence, hence the one we examine. Third and last, we posit that the psychological pain associated with parting from money is the force behind the physical-form-of-money effect. Saving money requires indeed to forego (i.e., set aside) money in the short term in order to have it available (possibly with interest) in the long term. We argue that the process of parting from money is psychologically more painful when the said money is in ""hard"" than ""soft"" form (i.e., cash v. dematerialized). We'll test these ideas in 5 main experiments supported by a series of pretests and pilot studies. Our methodological approach will favor between-subjects designs (i.e., paying people in cash vs. in dematerialized money) to observe their subsequent saving behavior (e.g., walk away with their pay now vs. leaving it within our lab's vault for a week in exchange of a premium). Our experiments will range from simple 2-group comparisons to multi-factorial designs (e.g., 2x2).","Rod Duclos, Rod Duclos","Western University, Western University"
175,Using Evidence to Inform Health Policy: Supportive Housing as a Case Study ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215833,"Government health policies rooted in evidence and collaboration are essential for safe and effective health care delivery. While the steps in policy development and the use of evidence to guide this process are well documented, the ways in which policy cycles work in 'real-world' and complex government settings are less well defined. This is especially the case for supportive housing (SH) services in Canada, where current policies inadequately describe the program purpose and recipients of care. Using SH as a case study, the purpose of my fellowship is to (i) understand how policy cycles 'work' in a complex government setting, (ii) explore how evidence can be used more effectively to ensure that policies achieve their intended goals, and (iii) investigate ways in which other stakeholders (e.g., regional planners, SH clients and their families) can contribute meaningfully to policy development. From these activities I will establish an enriched understanding of government context and the ways in which policies are developed, create synergistic partnerships with key government personnel and health service researchers, develop additional core competencies to help ensure my short- and long-term career success, and produce several publications and related knowledge translation activities (e.g., showing how evidence and intersectoral collaborations can be used to improve policy cycles). My fellowship will occur at Manitoba Health, Seniors and Active Living (MHSAL; Brie DeMone as primary supervisor) and the University of Manitoba (Dr. Malcolm Doupe as academic supervisor). These organizations and preceptors have a rich collaborative history through previous grants and government initiatives designed to train graduate students in applied health services research. Building on their experiences, my preceptors will meaningfully combine the research and policy aspects of the fellowship in ways that help to enrich my training experience and foster a learning health system.",Heather A Finnegan,University of Manitoba
176,Using FRC and UHPFRC with conventional reinforcement for the seismic design and rehabilitation of bridge piers and for the design of bridge superstructure elements ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/14824,"Canada is one of the world industrialised countries where strategic infrastructures are subjected to the most severe climatic conditions. In Quebec, 35% of the 10000 bridges still need to be rehabilitated for gravity loads and durability [1]. This rehabilitation process quickly becomes a never ending cycle due to the limited durability of repairs with conventional concrete. Knowledge gained in the past decades on the seismic hazard and on the deficiencies of several concrete structures demonstrated the vulnerability of structures built before 1980. This particularly affects bridges in densely populated regions of Canada. In fact, 80% of bridges in Quebec were built prior to modern seismic provisions, from which only a very few have been rehabilitated to conform to current seismic standards. This affects many lifeline and major-route bridges. Combining conventional reinforcements with fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) and ultra-high performance fibre reinforced concrete (UHPFRC) has been shown to be the most promising technical and economical solution for designing, rehabilitating and strengthening structural elements due to their exceptional structural performances and durability [12,13]. Although they are slowly but surely being introduced by some jurisdictions worldwide and in Canada in limited pilot projects, Canada's standards and industries are not yet prepared for implementing these innovative materials. Several issues still need to be addressed before sound and robust specifications become mandatory for the design and rehabilitation of concrete structures. This is the aim of this research proposal which focusses on developing knowledge, analytical tools, and design requirements to be implemented in the Canadian Bridge Code for using these innovative materials in structural applications based on rational principles. This application includes four projects that combine large scale testing on structural members, material testing, and nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) for assessing the behaviour of structural elements at member or local levels. Two projects are related with the seismic rehabilitation and design of concrete bridge piers: 1) on the plastic hinge length and strain penetration in footings of large rectangular bridge piers, and 2) on the confining effect of UHPFRC active cover and reinforcement on column strength for seismic rehabilitation, or for accelerated bridge construction (ABC) projects. Two projects focus on developing design requirements for introducing FRC and UHPFRC in the Canadian Bridge Code: 3) on the bond strength of anchored and lapped reinforcing bars in UHPFRC and 4) one the development of a reliability framework for designing with FRC and UHPFRC. The project will be realised with a well-balanced group of HQPs: one senior research associate, one PDF, and 4 PhD, 8 MSc students and a minimum of 10 undergraduate students.",Bruno Massicotte,Polytechnique Montréal
177,Using Population Based Data to Guide Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD) Policy Program and Policy Development in Manitoba ( 2017/18-2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/148734,"This fellowship is a one-year partnership position between the Healthy Child Manitoba Office (HCMO) and the Manitoba Centre for Healthy Policy (MCHP). HCMO was established to deliver the Government of Manitoba's mission for a long-term, cross-departmental prevention and early intervention strategy for putting children and families first. Led by the Healthy Child Committee of Cabinet, HCMO works across departments and sectors to develop community-based programs focused on achieving the best outcomes for all of Manitoba's children and youth. The fellow will work at HCMO under the supervision of the Senior Deputy Minister, Dr. Rob Santos for 70% of the fellowship. The remaning 30% will be spent at MCHP, under the supervision of Dr. Alan Katz, Director. MCHP is a research institution that houses the world renown MCHP Data Repository. The fellow will design and lead a project that prepares data from seven programs implemented by HCMO designed to prevent Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder and support families affected by FASD for research purposes and linkage with the MCHP Data Repository. This project will consist of working across the 6 departments of HCMO as well as with MCHP to analyze data sources, understand the programs the data comes from, and to define, scope out and cost research uses for the data; including refining the message, and identifying value to program planners and policy makers. Preparing these data for research is vital to ensuring that program implementation is based upon quality evidence based informed policy, and will ultimately enhance program delivery for people with FASD in Manitoba. The output from this project directly address HCMO impact goals by preparing data that ensures services and programs in Manitoba are based on strong research and evaluation, and enhances the power of the MCHP data Repository by adding another novel, dataset that facilitates research into social determinants.",Deepa Singal,University of Manitoba
178,Using photovoice to capture the housing-related needs of Vietnamese seniors in the GTA ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/187391,"In 2016, there were 240,615 Vietnamese in Canada total; with 73,740 residing in the Toronto CMA. Just under 20% of this were over the age of 55 (Statistics Canada, 2017). This study is very timely, as the Vietnamese senior's community is predominantly within the young senior category, 60% of them are within the age of 55-64. They have time to take the required steps in community planning and advocating for themselves for their later age in meeting Canada's seniors policy of ""Aging in Place"". Often subsumed within the pan-Asian studies, the unique needs of Vietnamese seniors, having mostly arrived at Canada as refugees of the Vietnam War, have not been clearly assessed in the literature. Golden Village for the Elderly's (GAVE) mandate is to ensure that Vietnamese seniors have access to affordable and culturally appropriate housing and support services so that seniors can continue aging in place with a healthy and fulfilling lifestyle. Based on their own lived experiences and years of providing recreational services to Vietnamese seniors, GAVE knew that Vietnamese seniors were struggling in their housing-related needs, and will struggle even more as these seniors age. They have been unable to effectively demonstrate this to funders and policy-makers because of limited relationship with the research community. They desired a linguistically and culturally competent researcher to conduct this research with. This study will address GAVE's immediate needs for data to inform decision making about advocacy strategies, directions on fund-seeking, and political lobbying activities. Given the gaps in the literature and the partnering organization's immediate needs, we proposed to conduct a community participatory action research (CPAR) using the method of photovoice (Wang, 1999). To explore the housing-related needs of Vietnamese seniors and their opportunities and challenges to ""aging in place"", this proposed project will address the question, ""What do Vietnamese seniors in the GTA need to live well in their immediate and future environments?"" To answer that question, the objectives of this study are: 1. To explore, using group interviewing and a survey, how Vietnamese seniors understand their well-being in relation to housing and to gather in-depth data on their housing needs; 2. To empower Vietnamese seniors and members of GAVE to tell their stories using images and accompanying narratives on their perceptions of what they need to age well in place; 3. To share the stories of these Vietnamese seniors with government, funders, and service providers so they can develop policies and practices for culturally appropriate housing and supports. Immigrant seniors often report language and cultural barriers as key to their challenges with Canadian health and social services, but also with these seniors' own Canadian raised children and grandchildren. Photovoice will aid them to bridge these language and intergenerational gaps in order voice their everyday housing-related challenges, needs, and strengths and to communicate it to their loved ones, caregivers, service providers, and decision-makers in the community. This study will work with 25 seniors in the Greater Toronto Area to capture images that represent their aging related experiences and needs when it comes to aging in place. At the same time, an online scoping survey to establish demographic details will be distributed across the GTA to understand living situations, needs, and preferences of Vietnamese seniors; and to inform the analysis of the photovoice images and narratives. This study will wrap-up with a photo exhibit of the project images as part of a needs awareness and promotion event. Representatives from government and service providers, and the community will be invited.",Anh P Ngo,Wilfrid Laurier University
179,VR Systems for Body Image and Body Schema ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/192279,"Recent research in the emerging field of embodied cognition demonstrates the mutual importance of*understanding the extent to which technologies affect our physical/physiological factors, and how our*assumptions about our bodies affect the ways we design technology. Thus, it is increasingly important to study*the fundamental processes of body schemas and body images. A body schema comprises the collection of*processes that are responsible for typically non-conscious processes such as posture and movement. A body*image refers to attitudes and beliefs we have about our body, which change over time, or when we face*disability or disease. Body schema and body image function as continuous, mutually influential processes that*provide important information about a user's psychophysiological state.*The focus of proposed body image/body schema research will be on immersive VR. Research in body ownership of VR avatars has led to important findings regarding visual, motor and tactile phenomena, as well as the role of time in how VR users gain a sense of ownership of their VR avatars. In essence, this tells us important information about body schema, but far less about body image. Moreover, while this research includes the adoption or ownership of non-human body parts, such as tails, it nevertheless assumes a healthy, normative body. However, certain conditions such as chronic and phantom pain are known to profoundly disturb body image and body schema. Moreover, while VR has been shown to be a form of pain alleviation, the mechanism that may explain this effect is still in its infancy, as are varied outcomes about how long this effect may persist after VR exposure. These are some examples of why it is important to gain a better understanding of how users gain an embodied sense of a VR avatar from a first person perspective - a perspective that includes body image.*This proposal aims to contribute to increasingly important research on fundamental human processes of body schema and body image. We propose to: *(i) investigate computation of body schema and body image by abstracting and modeling relevant correlates of each, (ii) identify relationships of body schema and image that together indicate variable psychophysiological user states, (iii) develop visualizations that correlate to changing user states, initially in VR avatars for range-of-movement studies in seniors, (iv) develop an interface that enables user annotations of body image data, (v) develop methods for accurate repeatability of capturing user state data, (vi) visualize aggregation of variable time frames for later analysis of longitudinal data of users. *The long-term objective of this research is two-fold: *1. To identify the theoretical underpinnings and formalisms necessary to devise computational models of variable body schema and image data. *2. To develop methods of assessment to provide empirical evidence of effectiveness.",Diane Gromala,Simon Fraser University
180,Victorian sociability: an International Workshop and Conference ( 2018/19 ),https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/184077,"VICTORIAN SOCIABILITY: AN INTERNATIONAL WORKSHOP AND CONFERENCE OVERVIEW: Victorian Sociability brings together emerging and established scholars from across North America working in the areas of Victorian studies, historical Geography, Libraries and Cultural Resources and the Digital Humanities to answer the question of how social networks could sustain the careers of Victorian writers, artists, editors and publishers, with a particular focus on women's networks. We will answer this question in two key, interrelated ways: 1. By creating an open-access tool, the Map of Victorian Literary Sociability, that maps the networks of Victorian cultural figures in and around two urban and literary centres, London and Edinburgh. 2. By sharing research papers, a roundtable discussion, and a keynote on the topics of Victorian sociability and the digital humanities. OBJECTIVES: Through hands-on workshops, a roundtable on collaboration, and conference papers, we aim to disseminate research, to stimulate collaboration, and to generate new knowledge about Victorian sociability and cultural networks. This will be a critical intervention on the challenges facing Victorian Studies in the twenty-first century as we move beyond the model of the solo scholar. EVENT COMPONENTS: We seek SSHRC support to host an event at the University of Calgary from May 1 to 3, 2019. The main components of the event are: 1. A hackathon style workshop on historical GIS mapping (Dan Jacobson, Geography and Peter Peller, Libraries) and genealogical databases for scholars (Christine Hayes, Calgary Public Library). 2. A workshop on the Orlando Project, a leading feminist database on women's writing to be led by Susan Brown (Canada Research Chair in the Digital Humanities), with Kathryn Holland, Senior Research Associate on the Orlando Project. 3. A keynote talk on ""Mid-Range Sociability"" from Alison Booth, director of the Scholar's Lab, University of Virginia. 4. A Roundtable on Collaboration within the field, across disciplines and in the community, featuring leading Canadian academics Jason Camlot, Mary Elizabeth Leighton and Lisa Surridge, alongside Annie Murray (Head of Special Collections, U of Calgary). OUTPUTS: Our open-access tool, the Map of Victorian Literary Sociability, will be collaboratively developed by participants and launched at the conference. The tool will be hosted for the first five years at the University of Calgary and afterwards at CWRC (the Canadian Research and Writing Collaboratory, PI Susan Brown) to ensure its sustainability and long-term availability to scholars as well as a general audience interested in nineteenth-century London and its authors. Furthermore, our open-access library guide will enable both scholars and genealogists to replicate our mapping techniques for academic purposes as well as for family history. AUDIENCES: True to its theme, Victorian Sociability will provide an opportunity for knowledge exchange, shared learning and future collaboration. This event will bring together an international community of delegates from Victorian studies, geography, and Library and Cultural Resources (both the university library and the Calgary Public Library) to enhance collaborative relationships across disciplines and units in the University, as well as within the local community.",Karen A Bourrier,University of Calgary

Underserved populations within mental health and addictions is our theme, with the goal of attendees to share research activities to ultimately improve patient care, decision-making, and health outcomes for the underserved, particularly in small communities. Our collaborator, the Evidence Exchange Network, a Provincial System Support Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, is mandated to build partnerships and networks for a better mental health system. Waypoint is a large psychiatric hospital with the only high-secure mental health forensic program in Ontario, one of few in Canada, and provides specialized mental health services for some of the most at-risk individuals, as well as a range of acute-care services. We are cognizant that for those residing in rural areas, services may be less accessible or available as in urban areas. Likewise, professionals and decision-makers who work in non-urban areas often find it a challenge to network and build collaborations to expand research and knowledge potential. Our objectives are to: 1)improve knowledge of and access to research to improve practice and policies 2)expand partnerships/collaborations to broaden knowledge translation and research alignments 3)improve communications across sectors, populations, and among individuals Conference presentations and workshops will lead to goal-oriented discussions on issues. A workshop by the EENet initiative, Sharing Together, will look at evidence stakeholders need to do their work well and transform mental health systems. Workshops on antipsychotic polypharmacy, psychosis/substance use, and managing schizophrenia with comorbid health conditions will provide CME credits. Dr. Zoe Hilton, Waypoint Senior Research Scientist, will hold a workshop about healthcare worker risk of trauma and ways to ensure staff wellbeing.","Barna Konkoly-Thege, Branka Agic","University of Toronto, University of Toronto"
