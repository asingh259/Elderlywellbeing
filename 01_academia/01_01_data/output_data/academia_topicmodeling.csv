0,Addressing the challenges of client retention and service utilization in elder abuse interventions ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),David Burnes,University of Toronto,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109991,"Elder abuse is a pervasive form of inter-personal violence in Canada that affects almost one out of every ten older adults in the community each year. Unresolved elder abuse is independently associated with serious consequences, including shortened survival, poor physical and mental health, and a diminished quality of life. With no coordinated elder abuse primary prevention efforts in place, the absolute scope of this problem is expected to double over the next 25 years in step with our aging population. The community-based elder abuse response system in Canada responsible for addressing substantiated cases of mistreatment is in a nascent stage of development. Across the country, the response system is composed of different, untested program models of intervention. Thus, increasing numbers of elder abuse victims each year are exposed to programs that lack evidence of effectiveness. Elder abuse scholars and experts widely recognize that knowledge of effective response interventions represents the greatest gap in the literature. Unless an older adult lacks cognitive capacity, elder abuse response programs are voluntary and older adult clients have the right to self-determination. Thus, elder clients can choose to refuse services altogether, drop out, or accept services with varying levels of commitment. Client attrition and under-utilization of services is a major problem facing elder abuse response programs. Lower levels of service utilization are associated with a heightened risk of re-victimization and, in turn, adverse health and psychosocial consequences. Identifying ways to engage older adult victims with response program support is a priority. Building directly from Insight Development Grant-funded work, the proposed study seeks to address the challenge of elder abuse response program client attrition and under-utilization of services. Informed by a postmodern, constructivist practice orientation that accepts multiple mistreatment realities and different perceptions of an appropriate solution across cases, this study aims to test the use of goal attainment scaling (GAS) as an intervention to enhance client retention and service utilization. GAS is a client-centered intervention that requires client-practitioner collaboration and mutual understanding of goals and tasks towards the objective of reducing the risk of re-victimization. By enhancing the working relationship between client and practitioner and empowering the client to be an active participant in the construction of a treatment plan, GAS is expected to increase levels of retention and service utilization. The proposed study has the potential to make important contributions to scholarship, community response programs and, ultimately, victims of elder abuse. Using prospective, randomized control trial research methods to test the GAS intervention, this study would represent one of the most rigorous elder abuse intervention studies to date both in Canada and worldwide and would help advance a limited elder abuse intervention literature. Identifying an evidence-based intervention for community elder abuse response programs would help strengthen an under-developed response system in Canada and inform daily practice with older adults. This research will reach a field of elder abuse that is inherently interdisciplinary, including gerontology, social work, law, criminal justice, medicine, and other disciplines. The proposed study is novel in that it represents the first formal attempt to address challenges of client retention and service utilization in the context of elder abuse intervention.",0.0884136212624584,elder abus pervas form inter person violenc canada affect older adult communiti year unresolv elder abus independ associ consequ includ shorten surviv poor physic mental health diminish qualiti life coordin elder abus primari prevent effort place absolut scope problem expect doubl year step age popul communiti base elder abus respons canada respons address substanti case mistreat nascent stage develop countri respons compos differ untest program model intervent increas number elder abus victim year expos program lack evid effect elder abus scholar expert wide recogn knowledg effect respons intervent repres greatest literatur older adult lack cognit capac elder abus respons program voluntari older adult client right self determin elder client choos refus servic altogeth drop accept servic vari level commit client attrit util servic major problem face elder abus respons program lower level servic util associ heighten risk victim turn advers health psychosoci consequ identifi way engag older adult victim respons program support prioriti build direct insight develop grant fund work propos studi seek address challeng elder abus respons program client attrit util servic inform postmodern constructivist practic orient accept multipl mistreat realiti differ percept appropri solut case studi aim test goal attain scale intervent enhanc client retent servic util client center intervent requir client practition collabor mutual understand goal task object reduc risk victim enhanc work relationship client practition empow client activ particip construct treatment plan expect increas level retent servic util propos studi potenti import contribut scholarship communiti respons program ultim victim elder abus prospect random control trial research method test intervent studi repres rigor elder abus intervent studi date canada worldwid help advanc limit elder abus intervent literatur identifi evid base intervent communiti elder abus respons program help strengthen develop respons canada inform daili practic older adult research reach field elder abus inher includ gerontolog social work crimin justic medicin disciplin propos studi novel repres formal attempt address challeng client retent servic util context elder abus intervent,0,"health, environment"
1,The potential for elders' cultural knowledge to contribute to a new education futurity ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),George Sefa Dei,University of Toronto,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113011,"Black youth in Canada face significant disparities in educational, social, and economic and employment outcomes, and formal educational systems continue to fail to meet their needs. The primary question we address is: How can we revise education to help address some of the challenges facing Black populations and the education of youth in particular? In many Indigenous communities around the world, Elders play an important and positive role in raising/educating youth. In Canada, prominent older members of the Black community could potentially play the role of supportive figures to diasporic Black youth, similar to Elders in other Indigenous communities. In order to develop best practices of such contribution, existing models of the role Elders play in education and social development of youth need to be studied. Thus, we aim to investigate the role of Elders in educating youth in African Indigenous communities and in Canadian educational institutions so as to support the contribution of older community members for youth education and development in Canadian Black communities. The study has 4 objectives: (1) clarify how African Elders could serve as cultural knowledge custodians in Canadian schools, the effects that Elders' cultural knowledge may have on Black and minority education, and challenges to integrating Elders into Canadian schools; (2) identify teachings relating to community, social responsibility, environment, Land, social justice, equity, youth leadership, respect, and mutual interdependence that can be learned from Elders, and how these could influence educational and social successes for youth and help develop a counter-vision of education; (3) identify the roles of, and challenges faced by, community Elders in the teaching of cultural knowledge in specific case studies in Africa and Canada; and (4) determine, by comparing and analyzing case studies, the most promising approaches that can be adopted by educators in pluralistic contexts who wish to work with local cultural knowledge in support of counter-visions for education. This study will be informed by an Indigenist anti-colonial analysis of how Indigenous cultural knowledge and ideas can subvert colonial relations, processes, and practices of education to improve learning outcomes for youth. Over the course of three years, we will conduct qualitative case study analyses of educational outlets that use Elders' cultural knowledges and incorporate Elders as educators. Data will be collected via interviews and focus group discussions with Elders, students, community and professional educators, and parents in two African countries (Ghana and South Africa) and two Black communities in Canada (Toronto and Halifax). The data will allow comparisons between national cultures/systems as well as local variations within each community and education site. Chosen sites in Africa are known for their pioneering work in Indigenous and cultural knowledge, and those in Canada have established community educational outlets that include Elders and their knowledges, along with professional educators. Findings will contribute to theory on Indigenization and decolonization in education, and will offer unique empirical data about the role of African Elders in education. The study will yield a book, scholarly referred articles, and non-refereed community publications for professional and practitioner audiences. The knowledge mobilization plan entails developing workshops and presentations for Canadian schools, and community sessions for educational practitioners. Conference presentations and other activities bring together students, educators, and community members to discuss ways for educational institutions to tap into the wealth of Elders' cultural knowledge.",0.1045454545454544,black youth canada face signific dispar educ social econom employ outcom formal educ system continu fail meet need primari question address revis educ help address challeng face black popul educ youth particular indigen communiti world elder play import posit role rais educ youth canada promin older member black communiti potenti play role support figur diaspor black youth similar elder indigen communiti order develop best practic contribut exist model role elder play educ social develop youth need studi investig role elder educ youth african indigen communiti canadian educ institut support contribut older communiti member youth educ develop canadian black communiti studi object clarifi african elder serv cultur knowledg custodian canadian school effect elder cultur knowledg black minor educ challeng integr elder canadian school identifi teach relat communiti social respons environ land social justic equiti youth leadership respect mutual interdepend learn elder influenc educ social success youth help develop counter vision educ identifi role challeng face communiti elder teach cultur knowledg specif case studi africa canada determin compar analyz case studi promis approach adopt educ pluralist context wish work local cultur knowledg support counter vision educ studi inform indigenist anti coloni analysi indigen cultur knowledg idea subvert coloni relat process practic educ improv learn outcom youth cours year conduct qualit case studi analys educ outlet elder cultur knowledg incorpor elder educ data collect interview focus group discuss elder student communiti profession educ parent african countri ghana south africa black communiti canada toronto halifax data allow comparison nation cultur system local variat communiti educ site choos sit africa know pioneer work indigen cultur knowledg canada establish communiti educ outlet includ elder knowledg profession educ find contribut theori indigen decolon educ offer uniqu empir data role african elder educ studi yield book scholar refer articl refere communiti public profession practition audienc knowledg mobil plan entail develop workshop present canadian school communiti session educ practition confer present activ bring student educ communiti member discuss way educ institut wealth elder cultur knowledg,0,"health, environment"
2,Supporting the creation of a LEARNing INteGrated health system to mobilize context-adapted knowledge with a Wiki platform to Improve the transitions of frail Seniors from from hospitals and emergency Departments to the cOMmunity: the LEARNING WISDOM Phase II scale-up project ( 2017/18-2020/21 ),Patrick Archambault,Laval University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/153228,"Elderly patients do not always receive the best care to help them return home after being discharged from the hospital. The connections between the hospital and community-care settings are often inadequate. As a result, elderly patients may be repeatedly readmitted to the hospital and their capacity to function may decrease. Caregivers may feel more burdened by the increasing care for their elderly loved ones. As well, healthcare costs increase. Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto developed the Acute Care for Elders (ACE) program to improve healthcare for the elderly. By using innovative strategies such as transition coaches, follow-up calls and patient self-care guides, the ACE program reduced lengths of hospital stay and readmissions for elderly patients, increased patient satisfaction, and saved the healthcare system over $6 million in 2014. In 2016, the Centre integre en sante et en services sociaux de Chaudiere-Appalaches (CISSS CA) received funding from the Canadian Foundation for Healthcare Improvement and support from Mount Sinai experts to implement the ACE Program in one hospital in the CISSS CA with a focus on improving transitions between hospital and the community for the elderly. The goal of this research project is to implement the ACE Program in three other hospitals within the CISSS CA, using a ""Wiki-suite"" to help adapt and apply the ACE Program to each hospital. The Wiki-suite is an open-source collaborative database of knowledge tools and a training program which help clinicians share information and improve patient care. Our research project will evaluate how the ACE program implemented and improved care transitions for the elderly at these hospitals. We will also evaluate how the Wiki-suite helped adapt and apply the ACE program in participating hospitals.",0.409375,elder patient receiv best care help return home discharg hospit connect hospit communiti care set inadequ result elder patient repeat readmit hospit capac function decreas caregiv feel burden increas care elder love one healthcar cost increas mount sinai hospit toronto develop acut care elder program improv healthcar elder innov strategi transit coach follow call patient self care guid program reduc length hospit stay readmiss elder patient increas patient satisfact save healthcar million centr integr sant servic sociaux chaudier appalach cisss receiv fund canadian foundat healthcar improv support mount sinai expert implement program hospit cisss focus improv transit hospit communiti elder goal research project implement program hospit cisss wiki suit help adapt appli program hospit wiki suit open sourc collabor databas knowledg tool train program help clinician share inform improv patient care research project evalu program implement improv care transit elder hospit evalu wiki suit help adapt appli program particip hospit,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

Care becomes fragmented, discontinuous, and costly. In addition, Quebec's Bill 10 has merged healthcare institutions but has not yet integrated their information, human resources or care management systems, resulting in further fragmentation of care. However, using proven (evidence-based) strategies can improve transition for the elderly. The Acute Care for Elders Program at Mount Sinai applied innovative strategies (interventions) which reduced lengths of hospital stay, reduced readmissions, increased patient satisfaction, and saved over $6 million in 2014. Strategies included providing transition coaches, follow-up calls and using discharge order sets and patient self-care guides (knowledge tools). Successful programs often remain an exception, however, because technical challenges and different organizational cultures make adapting them to other contexts difficult. Our WikiTrauma open-source collaborative database and Wiki 101 training program are designed so that a program can be adapted by the people affected (knowledge users) and then applied (implemented) locally. The ""Wiki-suite"" was successfully used in adapting trauma care, and now managers and clinicians want to apply it to geriatrics. This proposal will use the Wiki-suite to adapt and apply the Acute Care for Elders Program, specifically its care transitions component, in four hospitals in the Chaudieres-Appalaches region (CISSS CA) of Quebec. We will assess the impact of using the Wiki-suite to adapt and apply the ACE Program by asking managers, clinicians and patients about its effects on patient empowerment, health outcomes, and costs. We will also explore how the Wiki-suite works in terms of behavior and organizational change to gain insight into using it to adapt any successful program to any local context (scale up).",0.2375,elder patient discharg emerg depart repeat readmit lose function capac increas caregiv burden care care fragment discontinu cost addit quebec merg healthcar institut integr inform human resourc care manag system result fragment care prove evid base strategi improv transit elder acut care elder program mount sinai appli innov strategi intervent reduc length hospit stay reduc readmiss increas patient satisfact save million strategi includ provid transit coach follow call discharg order set patient self care guid knowledg tool success program remain except technic challeng differ organiz cultur adapt context difficult wikitrauma open sourc collabor databas wiki train program design program adapt peopl affect knowledg user appli implement local wiki suit success adapt trauma care manag clinician want appli geriatr propos wiki suit adapt appli acut care elder program specif care transit compon hospit chaudier appalach region cisss quebec assess impact wiki suit adapt appli program ask manag clinician patient effect patient empower health outcom cost explor wiki suit work term behavior organiz chang gain insight adapt success program local context scale,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

In Canada, the elderly have been particular vulnerable, with long-term care homes experiencing the greatest burdens of illness and mortality. Civil society and our usual social fabric have been torn, due to illness, loss, school and work interruptions and social distancing. No Canadian sector has been untouched. There is an ongoing risk of acute health care systems being overwhelmed, including the care for our sickest Canadians. To meet the challenge of knowing how to best prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, we need coordinated and supported national research, that is responsive to the needs of citizens, patients, families and health systems, and benefits from the expertise of clinicians, researchers, industry, our public health, clinical and biomedical research infrastructure. Bringing the best prevention, diagnostic tests and treatments to Canadians as quickly as possible demands that we work together as Canadians, and with partners around the world. The Canadian Network of COVID-19 Clinical Trials Networks is a diverse, inclusive partnership that will bring resources to partners to get the most from our research response. We will engage citizens and patients, help set dynamic research priorities involving the public and private sectors, facilitate collaboration and resource sharing, harmonize clincial trial procedures, make the research regulatory steps easier, connect data from many clinical trials, mobilize the knowledge we gain to prevent infection, treat patients, help them recover, and end this pandemic.

En 2017, les gestionnaires de l'Unite de soins de courte duree geriatrique (UCDG) du CHU de Quebec-Universite Laval - l'Hopital Saint-Francois d'Assise (HSFA) ont mesure l'impact du vieillissement de la population locale et les besoins en ressources hospitalieres de leur UCDG, et le constat etait inquietant : on anticipe, en 2031, une augmentation de 175% du nombre de consultations a l'urgence et de 165% le nombre d'hospitalisation.

7,Facilitating access across the pregnancy continuum of care - A health system intervention to improve care transitions and health outcomes for Indigenous women in northern Manitoba ( 2019/20 ),France Légaré,Laval University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/214869,"Pregnancy is a time of transition for women and families. Throughout pregnancy women receive care in a variety of health settings including office medical care, ultrasound departments, hospitals for birth, and at home after discharge from hospital. Each of these transition requires a connection to various health care providers. The federal government provides health care in most First Nations communities however, in order to receive obstetrical consultations, ultrasound services, and to deliver their babies, women need to transition to the provincial health care system adding yet another layer of complexity. Many barriers including, travel, transportation issues, financial constraints, poor communication, different providers, and weak referral links are encountered through those transitions. For many, relocating for care and birth away from home is characterized by insecurity, strange surroundings, and isolation from family. Women often experience a lack of choice, control and power in these transitions. Effective transitions with improved linkages between programs and services is needed with opportunities for women to participate in shared decision making with their health care providers is a culturally safe manner. A northern pregnancy network is proposed to improve access to care, assist with navigation of complex system transitions, and improve linkages between service providers across systems. The network will be made up of system navigators linked to a core team of service providers, community members and guided by Elders. Culturally safe care and shared-decision making are foundational. It is not enough to facilitate access and navigation, services need to be inclusive and respectful of Indigenous health beliefs. These strategies are expected to increase use of care, decrease low birth weight and premature birth, increase breastfeeding, increase use of well-child care and vaccination rates, and improve patient experiences.",0.1381578947368421,pregnanc time transit women famili pregnanc women receiv care varieti health set includ offic medic care ultrasound depart hospit birth home discharg hospit transit requir connect health care provid feder govern provid health care nation communiti order receiv obstetr consult ultrasound servic deliv babi women need transit provinci health care add layer complex barrier includ travel transport issu financi constraint poor communic differ provid weak referr link encount transit reloc care birth away home character insecur strang surround isol famili women experi lack choic control power transit effect transit improv linkag program servic need opportun women particip share decis make health care provid cultur safe manner northern pregnanc network propos improv access care assist navig complex transit improv linkag servic provid system network navig link core team servic provid communiti member guid elder cultur safe care share decis make foundat facilit access navig servic need inclus respect indigen health belief strategi expect increas care decreas birth weight prematur birth increas breastfe increas child care vaccin rat improv patient experi,-1,"health, environment"

Recognizing the growing prevalence of frailty and the dearth of research evidence to address the complex care needs of frail elderly Canadians, in 2012 NCE awarded CFN (Technology Evaluation in the Elderly Network) a funding mandate to improve the care of frail elderly Canadians and their families within the Canadian healthcare system through the development, rigorous evaluation and ethically-guided implementation of evidence-informed care strategies and practices. The burden of frailty in Canada is steadily growing. Today, approximately 25% of seniors over age 65 and 50% past 85 – over one million Canadians – are medically frail. These individuals are at higher risk for poor health outcomes, adverse events and mortality than would be expected based on their age alone. Frail elderly Canadians are over-represented in all sectors of the healthcare system including primary care, community and residential care, acute care and end-of-life care, and frailty is associated with increased healthcare resource consumption. In 10 years, based on population growth it is estimated that well over two million Canadians will be living with frailty and this growing population is both under-recognized and under-serviced, challenging the healthcare system to improve the quality and quantity of care delivered.",-0.0095238095238095,canadian frailti network canada network centr excel focus frailti common recogn health state associ function declin chronic ill multipl health problem cognit impair poorer health outcom late life recogn grow preval frailti dearth research evid address complex care need frail elder canadian award technolog evalu elder network fund mandat improv care frail elder canadian famili canadian healthcar develop rigor evalu ethic guid implement evid inform care strategi practic burden frailti canada steadili grow today approxim senior past million canadian medic frail individu higher risk poor health outcom advers event mortal expect base frail elder canadian repres sector healthcar includ primari care communiti residenti care acut care life care frailti associ increas healthcar resourc consumpt year base popul growth estim million canadian live frailti grow popul recogn servic challeng healthcar improv qualiti quantiti care deliv,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
9,Derivation of a clinical decision rule for emergency department head CT scanning in seniors who have fallen. ( 2018/19-2020/21 ),Marcel Emond,Centre hospitalier de l'Université Laval,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/180848,"There is very little research on diagnosing serious head injury (brain bleeds) in the elderly. One in three seniors experiences a fall each year and half of these people are treated in the emergency department. Almost all serious head injuries in older adults are caused by falling, and one case in six is fatal. Although falls are common for seniors, only 5% of those who are seen in the emergency department have a brain bleed. Over half of the seniors who go to the emergency department after a fall have a head CT scan. Currently, very few head scans done in the emergency department are positive for a brain bleed and the diagnosis is initially missed in 1 in 5 patients with a brain bleed. Ordering a head scan can prolong the emergency department stay by several hours. The emergency department can be an unpleasant and uncomfortable environment. We will create a new test (a clinical decision rule) which tells emergency doctors whether a head scan is needed or not. We will ensure that this new rule is safe. The rule will identify everyone who has a brain bleed, but will also lead to fewer head scans overall. This will allow patients with brain bleeds to receive the care they need and avoid unnecessarily long waits in the emergency department for those who do not have a brain bleed. Our study will follow 4000 people over the age of 65, who are treated in emergency departments across Canada after a fall. The emergency doctor will collect information about the risks of having a brain bleed and will follow a protocol for ordering a head scan. We will follow each patient for 6 weeks, to determine whether they are diagnosed with bleeding in the brain or not. We will use this information to develop a simple and safe test designed to guide emergency head scanning and improve the quality of care offered to seniors.",-0.0636706349206349,littl research diagnos head injuri brain bleed elder senior experi fall year half peopl treat emerg depart head injuri older adult caus fall case fatal fall common senior see emerg depart brain bleed half senior emerg depart fall head scan current head scan emerg depart posit brain bleed diagnosi initi miss patient brain bleed order head scan prolong emerg depart stay hour emerg depart unpleas uncomfort environ creat test clinic decis rule tell emerg doctor head scan need ensur rule safe rule identifi brain bleed lead fewer head scan overal allow patient brain bleed receiv care need avoid unnecessarili long wait emerg depart brain bleed studi follow peopl treat emerg depart canada fall emerg doctor collect inform risk have brain bleed follow protocol order head scan follow patient week determin diagnos bleed brain inform develop simpl safe test design guid emerg head scan improv qualiti care offer senior,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
10,Reducing post-discharge adverse drug events amongst the elderly: a multi-centre electronic deprescribing intervention ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),David L Buckeridge,McGill University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/152957,"Polypharmacy, or the concomitant use of 5 drugs or more, is a serious health concern and affects more than half of Canadians aged 65 years and older. It is the number one identifiable risk factor for adverse drug events (ADEs), which are responsible for 27,000 hospital admissions annually in Canada and up to 20% of return visits to the hospital within 30 days of discharge. Many ADEs are preventable or ameliorable through interventions to reduce inappropriate prescribing. Our intervention applies an electronic set of criteria, previously designed and piloted by a group of Ontario geriatricians, internists, palliative care doctors and pharmacists, to identify potentially inappropriate medications (PIMs) in the hospitalized elderly. We will update existing software called MedSafer, which identifies PIMs and generates instructions for the patient and physician for safe discontinuation, with these criteria. Our study seeks to partially automate the deprescribing process and to demonstrate the efficacy of this type of intervention on important patient outcomes. At the time of hospitalization, the patient's medications, comorbidities, and a measure of frailty will be entered into the MedSafer software which will output an individualized and prioritized deprescription plan for the most responsible physician's consideration. Any subsequent medication changes will be transmitted to relevant community physicians.

Immediate research is needed to evaluate the impacts COVID-19 has had on the development and delivery of virtual Elder-led supports for Elders, Grandmothers, knowledge keepers, and Indigenous survivors of violence, particularly as COVID-19 countermeasures have exacerbated pre-existing health and social inequities, deepened social isolation, and restricted Indigenous ceremonies (UN, 2020). Our community-based, Indigenous-led research team proposes the upscaling, delivery, and evaluation of the ""Virtual Resilience & Wellness Journey Program Pathway"" at the Native Women's Association of Canada (NWAC)'s Resiliency Lodge, an Elder-led program that provides distinctions-based, land-based, culturally-safe, trauma-informed support online for Indigenous women, two-spirit, and gender-diverse people healing from trauma and violence. We propose the use of participatory action methodologies with Elders, Grandmothers, Knowledge Holders, Resiliency Lodge staff, and other Indigenous-led virtual support programs in Canada to address the research questions: What are the impacts of COVID-19 on the development and delivery of Elder-led support services?

12,Developing a comprehensive understanding of elder abuse prevention in immigrant communities ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),Guida C Man,York University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107947,"Background: Older adults are the fastest-growing age group in Canada. In 2011, an estimated 5 million Canadians were 65 or older, and by 2050, about one in four Canadians is expected to be 65 or over. Elder abuse is already a growing problem with significant societal implications and, given these demographics, is critical to address. Scholars are increasingly focusing on elder abuse, but little is known about the risk factors -- which include complex social variables -- for elder abuse within immigrant communities or what interventions might best prevent elder abuse in these communities. Purpose: The purpose of this multidisciplinary study is: first, to develop a comprehensive classification of risk factors for elder abuse in immigrant communities: because immigrants represent an increasingly large proportion of older adults in Canada, it is critical to clarify these complex variables and how they combine to increase older immigrants' risk of elder abuse; and second, to identify the most appropriate and culturally relevant strategies to address the risk factors in immigrant communities in Canada. The study builds on the literature and our own work in this area, and addresses a knowledge, policy, and practice gap identified by various stakeholders across Canada. Theoretical approaches: Theoretically, our study is guided by the intersectionality perspective and an ecological framework, allowing us to critically examine the complexity surrounding multiple dimensions of social identity (e.g., gender, race, class, culture, immigration status) and how these interrelate at the micro (individual and family), meso (community), and macro (societal) levels. Consistent with this theoretical framework, we will use a collaborative, community-based, mixed-methods approach to enable stakeholders to actively determine where research should be conducted, which factors are relevant to abuse, and strategies consistent with cultural beliefs, values, and preferences of the immigrant communities. Research plan: We will conduct structured group interviews with older women and men who have experienced abuse, family members, and formal and informal leaders from immigrant communities, and social and settlement service providers in the Greater Toronto Area. We will include two established and two recent communities from both the East Asian and South Asian immigrant communities: Chinese, Korean, Punjabi, and Tamil. Our team has expertise conducting research on elder abuse in immigrant communities in Canada, has well-established working relationships with these communities, and has conducted research of this scale on related topics. Quantitative and qualitative data collected via structured group interviews will be analyzed at the level of particular group interview, subgroups, and communities, and will be integrated across communities to identify common and unique risk factors and intervention strategies. We will pay particular attention to various social dimensions including gender, age, culture, length of stay in Canada, fluency in English, employment and income, and extended family co-residence. Potential impact: The proposed approach is comprehensive in that it will incorporate local knowledge and expert contributions from immigrant women and men, family members, community members, and service providers and policymakers at each phase of the study. As a result, the findings will be relevant so as to contribute to the well being and social needs of older men and women in immigrant communities. The findings will contribute empirically and theoretically, as well as to policy debate and practice change, which will have local, national, and international significance.",0.1287025827280064,background older adult fastest grow group canada estim million canadian older canadian expect elder abus grow problem signific societ implic give demograph critic address scholar increas focus elder abus littl know risk factor includ complex social variabl elder abus immigr communiti intervent best prevent elder abus communiti purpos purpos studi develop comprehens classif risk factor elder abus immigr communiti immigr repres increas larg proport older adult canada critic clarifi complex variabl combin increas older immigr risk elder abus second identifi appropri cultur relev strategi address risk factor immigr communiti canada studi build literatur work area address knowledg polici practic identifi stakehold canada theoret approach theoret studi guid perspect ecolog framework allow critic examin complex surround multipl dimens social ident gender race class cultur immigr status interrel micro individu famili meso communiti macro societ level consist theoret framework collabor communiti base mix method approach enabl stakehold activ determin research conduct factor relev abus strategi consist cultur belief valu prefer immigr communiti research plan conduct structur group interview older women experi abus famili member formal inform leader immigr communiti social settlement servic provid greater toronto area includ establish recent communiti east asian south asian immigr communiti chines korean punjabi tamil team expertis conduct research elder abus immigr communiti canada establish work relationship communiti conduct research scale relat topic quantit qualit data collect structur group interview analyz level particular group interview subgroup communiti integr communiti identifi common uniqu risk factor intervent strategi particular attent social dimens includ gender cultur length stay canada fluenci english employ incom extend famili resid potenti impact propos approach comprehens incorpor local knowledg expert contribut immigr women famili member communiti member servic provid policymak phase studi result find relev contribut social need older women immigr communiti find contribut empir theoret polici debat practic chang local nation intern signific,-1,"health, environment"

The focus of this Indigenous knowledge development project is on wellness - promoting, maintaining and re-gaining wellness, by itself, or in the context of a variety of conditions or life circumstances that First Nations, Inuit and Metis peoples may find themselves. There is much Indigenous health and wellness knowledge/wisdom that has yet to be re-awakened, and in fact, cannot be well-supported in our current colonized structures and conceptualizations. To do so will take the development and re-development of roles and processes within community. It is within this context that we see Indigenous community as being the primary research leader, with the academy and the health system as being knowledge users. We propose a network of Indigenous health knowledge development centres. These centres will be grounded in the land and in culture, with land-based Indigenous research methodologies a critical component of the network. Using a health determinants approach and working with communities of Indigenous people including Elders, Knowledge Holders, youth, researchers and health workers, we will explore what makes Indigenous people well, what keeps them well, and how Indigenous wellness can be achieved or re-gained and maintained through practices and interventions based on traditional and western knowledge. Through meaningful engagement between academic centres and Indigenous communities, our network of knowledge development centres will increase and build on our understanding of wellness.

With funding from CIHR, we are building upon ten years of work with the Aboriginal Community Resilience to HIV/AIDS (ACRA) project through continued partnership with three Northern Alberta First Nation communities. DRUM is culturally grounded, community-led and based on identified strengths. We are working together to develop, test and evaluate shared-care models (SCM) for HIV, Hep C and other STBBI prevention and care services on-reserve. Our team includes members from each community (including community research associates (CRAs)), Elders, people with lived experience, policy makers, clinicians/health care providers, FNIHB regional representation, and researchers from BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Canadian Aboriginal AIDS Network. There is a strong two-way capacity-strengthening component built into the project. Through our work together on DRUM, we have learned there is promise in our approach. What is DRUM 2? DRUM 2 will build on the work of DRUM. Our team will continue our work with communities of different Indigenous cultures and in different regions of Alberta, supporting each other as we improve HIV, Hep C and other STBBI prevention and care services within a SCM development process for First Nation and Metis communities. With guidance from an Elders Council, we will study how programs are developed, adapted, implemented, and whether they meet their implementation goals. The CRAs from DRUM 1 will act as mentors/resources for the DRUM 2 new communities who participate in the DRUM process to develop and implement their own SCM. Importantly, DRUM 2 also provides the opportunity to learn by comparing different community approaches for shared care, including communities who use the DRUM process, and other communities in other regions of Canada who have developed their own shared care models.

This forced disconnection, in combination with a number of other historical, socioeconomic and structural determinants, is recognized as an enabling factor in the current health inequities faced by many Indigenous communities. To address these health disparities, the adoption of community-based and -driven initiatives has been strongly recommended. The proposed research project will be based in two northern Saskatchewan communities - the Northern Village of Pinehouse and the Northern Hamlet of Patuanak. Both communities have identified projects with an emphasis on cultural continuity in the areas of addressing mental wellness and elder care issues. There will be an additional focus on fostering nation-to-nation relationships in the development and implementation of these projects to strengthen capacity within these communities. We propose that dedicating resources to community-led initiatives, building strong relationships of trust and mutual respect between academia and Indigenous communities, applying an inclusive lens in sharing knowledge about approaches to wellness, increasing community capacity and strengthening collaborative relationships offer a promising path toward reconciliation.

More critical to this project, an Elder and youth member of our Advisory Council recently tested positive, reiterating the dire need for scalable, innovative platforms such as CO-Away to minimize the impact of subsequent COVID-19 waves in Indigenous communities in Saskatchewan. CO-Away is a culturally appropriate digital epidemiological platform to monitor, mitigate, and manage Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreaks. The CO-Away platform consists of two key components - a frontend virtual care smartphone application (app), and a backend digital decision-making dashboard. The app provides three key precision medicine services that are specific to each citizen: 1) continuous risk assessment of contracting COVID-19 via the virtual doctor feature; 2) evidence-based public health communication; and 3) Citizen reporting of food availability, access to public services, and COVID-19 symptoms and test results - these culturally-responsive features have been co-created with Ile-a-la-Crosse Metis decision-makers based on imminent community needs and preferences. The data from the virtual care app is transferred in real-time to a digital decision-maker dashboard, which is securely accessed by the Metis Mayor of Ile-a-la-Crosse. The dashboard will enable the Mayor's office to assess both individual and community risk, including direct risk of COVID-19, as well as indirect effects such as food insecurity.

Elderly patients with previous heart attack or stroke, or hypertension or diabetes, have high risk of getting infected. Surprisingly they also suffer 3 to 5 times the chance of dying compared to other infected patients. A clue may lie in a group of commonly used medicines, called renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blocks or ARBs, usually extremely protective for our cardiovascular patients. But they have come under attack because they are suspected to increase the levels of ACE2 in the body, also part of RAS, which is the receptor for the virus, or the doorway for virus to enter our body. So are these agents safe or dangerous? This has become a major source of fear for both patients and physicians alike, and a raging controversy. To answer this question, we analyzed data from Wuhan, and found that these agents actually to be extremely protective. This finding was also replicated in another study examining patients in Europe and America. However, these data looked backwards at events past, which can be fraught with hidden biases. Therefore, the world desperately needs a proper forward-looking trial to evaluate these agents in COVID-19. Together with our Canadian and international partners experienced in COVID-19 research, we are starting this large trial to evaluate whether adding ACE inhibitors, or ARB's, compared to no added treatment in high risk COVID-19 patients, can decrease the chance of dying, requiring ventilators or ICU. A positive trial showing benefit will potentially save many lives in the world, using a very simple and cheap set of medications. Even if we found the medications to be safe, it will be very reassuring for millions of patients.

Very few specialists can accurately advise seniors which medications provide more benefit than harm for them personally, and make changes safely as this requires a very large breadth and depth of knowledge about the patient, the conditions they have and their therapies. Now that telemedicine is compatible with smart phones, this extends the ability of scarce specialists to 'see' any patient in Canada in a way that is more convenient for the patient and may be less expensive than current care. This project will find out whether a unique Clinical Pharmacology specialist team in Hamilton, Ontario can improve medication safety (stop medications no longer needed, reduce doses where appropriate, change to safer medications) for a high risk group of older hospitalized Canadians taking many medications. The hospital where this pilot study will take place was the first to install the world's leading electronic health record and set it up to facilitate and support high quality research. Patients who volunteer will be assigned to their usual care, or to the intervention which is the Clinical Pharmacology specialist team approach starting in hospital and following up with the patient at home using telemedicine and detailed communication with them, their caregiver, family physician, community pharmacist and other specialists.

22,SAFE PNB -Safe Analgesia For Elders receiving Peripheral Nerve Blocks for hip fracture ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),Alan J Forster,Ottawa Hospital Research Institute,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/214854,"Over 20,000 older Canadians break their hips yearly, a painful occurrence that usually requires surgery. Older people who have a hip fracture are also at high risk of bad health outcomes. Over 20% of older people with a hip fracture have a serious complication, many do not regain the full ability to walk after surgery, and 25% die within six months. This means that we need to develop ways to make hip fracture care safer. Because hip fractures cause a lot of pain, strong painkillers (like morphine and other opioid drugs) are often needed. But these drugs can have serious side effects, like breathing problems, memory loss and delirium. Unfortunately, if hip fracture pain isn't treated, patients can also suffer issues with their ability to walk and move, their memory function, and other serious complications. So, finding ways to effectively manage hip fracture pain without strong opioid medications could lead to less pain and lower rates of bad health outcomes. Research suggests that using nerve blocks, where local anesthetic (aka freezing) medication is injected near the pain nerves that supply the fracture, can improve pain and decrease complications. While these improvements sound promising, recent reports also tell of a person dying after a nerve block because the health system wasn't properly set up to care for the nerve block in a high-risk hip fracture patient. This means that before nerve blocks are widely used for hip fracture pain, we should do research to understand their safety profile and how the health system can best-support safely giving these nerve blocks. To help to understand the safety profile of nerve blocks, we propose a study to: (1) define how often complications arise directly related to nerve blocks, (2) to determine how the health system could be best prepared to safely provide nerve blocks, and (3) to see if using nerve blocks leads to an overall increase or decrease in complications during hip fracture hospital stays.",0.0169696969696969,older canadian break hip year pain occurr usual requir surgeri older peopl fractur high risk health outcom older peopl fractur complic regain abil walk surgeri month mean need develop way fractur care safer fractur caus pain strong painkil like morphin opioid drug need drug effect like breath problem memori loss delirium unfortun fractur pain treat patient suffer issu abil walk memori function complic find way effect manag fractur pain strong opioid medic lead pain lower rat health outcom research suggest nerv block local anesthet freez medic inject near pain nerv suppli fractur improv pain decreas complic improv sound promis recent report tell person die nerv block health wasn proper care nerv block high risk fractur patient mean nerv block wide fractur pain research understand safeti profil health best support safe give nerv block help understand safeti profil nerv block propos studi defin complic aris direct relat nerv block determin health best prepar safe provid nerv block nerv block lead overal increas decreas complic fractur hospit stay,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

L'ampleur du problème et ses conséquences psychologiques, physiques et sociales chez les aînés maltraités ou témoins dénotent de l'urgence d'agir. Peu des quelques outils de sensibilisation et de prévention de la maltraitance entre aînés sont validés et sont applicables en RPA. Aucun ne propose une perspective globale d'intervention alliant des actions de lutte contre la maltraitance aux actions de promotion du « bien vivre ensemble ». Préoccupés par le bien-être des aînés vivant en RPA et par l'amélioration continue de leurs pratiques visant à contrer la maltraitance entre résidents et de promotion du « bien vivre ensemble » en RPA, Chartwell Mastercare LP, La Fondation Jasmin Roy Sophie Desmarais, DIRA-Estrie, le Centre collégial d'expertise en gérontologie du Cégep de Drummondville, ainsi que 4 autres partenaires potentiels se joignent à l'équipe de recherche afin de mener conjointement le projet selon une démarche de recherche participative. Trois cadres théoriques sont mobilisés dans cette étude : l'approche écosystémique de Bronfenbrenner (1979), l'approche d'Intervention Mapping (Bartholomew, 2011), et le Purposeful Program Theory (Funnell et Rogers, 2011). Ce projet a pour but de développer et d'implanter un programme de lutte contre les situations de maltraitance entre résidents et de promotion du « bien vivre ensemble » au sein des RPA. En s'appuyant sur les besoins des résidents, des employés et des cadres chez Chartwell, ainsi qu'un inventaire des pratiques existantes, ce projet vise à : 1. Documenter les pratiques de lutte contre maltraitance entre résidents et de promotion du « bien vivre ensemble » en RPA; 2. Élaborer un programme visant à lutter contre les situations de maltraitance entre résidents (prévention, repérage, intervention) et à promouvoir le « bien vivre ensemble » en RPA et puis l'implanter; 3. Réaliser une évaluation développementale de l'implantation du programme visant à lutter contre les situations de maltraitance entre résidents et à promouvoir le « bien vivre ensemble » en RPA. L'état des connaissances sur les pratiques et les besoins en matière de lutte contre la maltraitance entre résidents et de promotion du « bien vivre ensemble » sera mis à jour tout au long du projet. L'objectif 1 sera atteint par des collectes de données qualitatives, sous forme de récits narratifs. L'objectif 2 sera atteint en mobilisant un comité de travail, composé de résidents et d'employés, travaillant de concert avec l'équipe de recherche et les partenaires afin d'élaborer un programme d'intervention, en français et en anglais, qu'ils implanteront au sein de trois résidences Chartwell. L'objectif 3 sera atteint au moyen d'une évaluation développementale de l'implantation du programme.

24,Use of indicator acid oxidation to determine amino acid requirement ( 2015/16-2020/21 ),Rajavel Elango,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/150243,"Protein is a key component of the diet which allows growth and maintenance of health. All body proteins are made up of 20 amino acids. Among these 20 amino acids there are 9 amino acids, which our body cannot make, and therefore must come from food sources, and are called essential amino acids. The rest of the 11 amino acids can be made in our body if there is enough protein and calories in our food. But under some conditions, such as infants, people with disease, pregnant women, lactating women, elderly, the body may need more protein and essential amino acids. Until now, studying pregnant and lactating women, elderly and their protein (amino acid) needs has been difficult, because previous methods require invasive techniques and week-long test diets. This could cause harm in pregnancy to the actively growing fetus, and in elderly people. We have recently started to use a very minimally invasive state-of-the-art method, using stable isotopes and collection of breath samples to determine amino acid and protein needs. Stable isotopes are completely safe, and these methods are rapid and quick and require only one day of the test diets. Using this method we recently showed that the actual requirements for protein are quite high, compared to current recommendations. We are in now in a position to study this further and also find out the different essential amino acid that our body needs during different stages of pregnancy, lactation and elderly. Our results will help in making diet and nutrition recommendations to make sure both mother and baby are actively growing, and have a healthy, successful pregnancy.

From an economic perspective, statin treatment for preventing a first cardiovascular event in people at high risk of a cardiovascular event would be advantageous. Unfortunately, few studies have investigated the benefits and risks of statins for preventing a first cardiovascular events in the elderly. Although these studies indicate there are benefits for these people as well, much remains to be known about the full range of benefits and risks. Data are particularly scarce for very old people, elderly that already have many diseases or those that are already taking multiple drugs. Finally, it is unclear if the benefits that have been observed in clinical trials fully translate in real life, because medical monitoring is often better in clinical trials than it is in real life. For instance, it is known that people do not take their statin medication as well in real life as they do in clinical trials. The primary goal of this project is to provide additional evidence regarding the real-life benefits and risks of statins medication in the elderly for preventing a first cardiovascular event. To do this, we will use data from anonymized population-wide administrative databases. We will examine the patterns of how the elderly get statin medication over time and see how these different patterns are associated with the occurrence of cardiovascular events, mortality or possible major side effects. We will also perform an economic evaluation of statin treatment. To be able to do this, we will first need to develop new data analysis methods.

High emergency department use among home care clients reflects their relative health complexity, and the lack of appropriate supportive chronic disease management services in the community-based home care. Building on our previous pilot work, we propose a three-year research agenda to further adapt and test chronic disease management interventions in home care. Known as the DIVERT-CARE (Collaboration Action Research & Evaluation) Study, the project will be led by a multi-provincial collaboration of home care partners and researchers.

The inequities in diabetes and obesity can be traced back to several forms of transgenerational trauma, stress and adversity that accompanies settler-led cultural genocide and on-going institutional racism that Indigenous children face. Strengths-based, resilience, centred programs are therefore needed to overcome these inequities. With the support of Indigenous youth in Manitoba, we developed a peer-based mentoring program, centred on an Indigenous model of resilience; Dr.Martin Brokenleg's Circle of Courage, called the Indigenous Youth Mentorship Program (IYMP).

29,Long-term immune activation by a mucosal RSV subunit vaccine: mechanism of action and application to vaccination of elderly ( 2020/21 ),Sylvia Van Drunen Littel-van den Hurk,University of Saskatchewan,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/230309,"While previously underestimated, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) contributes to a significant proportion of severe respiratory disease and mortality in the elderly, similar to influenza. With a growing elderly population, a RSV vaccine is urgently needed, but not available. The elderly tend to respond more weakly or inconsistently to vaccination unless they receive vaccines that are specifically developed for them. Our overall objective is to develop and characterize a RSV vaccine for elderly. As RSV infects the respiratory tract, the presence of virus neutralizing antibodies at this site is critical. Boosting and maintaining high neutralizing activity of antibodies in the serum by intramuscular vaccine administration may be adequate as serum antibodies can penetrate and protect the lower airways and lungs. However, mucosal immunization is required to induce production of local IgA antibody and the correct type of T lymphocytes in the respiratory tract. We already have a safe, effective vaccine candidate consisting of a protective antigen of RSV and an immunostimulatory adjuvant. When administered either intramuscularly or intranasally, this RSV vaccine induces long-term, protective immunity in several neonatal and adult animal models, e.g. mice, cotton rats and lambs. We have evidence that this vaccine also elicits an immune response in old mice. We will evaluate the magnitude and longevity of this immune response, as well as protection from RSV infection in old animals, and if necessary optimize the RSV vaccine. Furthermore, we will fully characterize the properties of this vaccine, which will expedite human clinical trials and licensing. An effective RSV vaccine will decrease morbidity and mortality due to RSV infection, which will in the future, improve the health of the elderly and significantly reduce health care costs.

30,"Management of psychosocial stressors across older adulthood: the age-related roles of discrete emotions, motivational tendencies, and control strategies ( 2017/18-2019/20 )",Christiane Hoppmann,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113299,"The population of industrialized countries is aging and individuals in advanced old age (80+ years) represent the fastest growing segment of the population (Christensen et al., 2009). Advanced old age is also characterized by an increasing experience of psychosocial stressors (e.g., difficulty with goal attainment, life regrets, or social losses), which can compromise many areas of psychological functioning (Baltes & Smith, 2003). Of importance, the adaptive value of psychological processes that older adults could use to manage age-related stressors is thought to depend on an individual's life phase and associated age-related declines in the controllability of stressors (Heckhausen et al., 2010). As a consequence, the proposed research is based on the premise that individuals in early and advanced old age need to optimize their psychological outcomes by responding to stressful experiences in different ways. Our theoretical approach assumes that both specific negative emotions (i.e., sadness versus anger) and certain motivational tendencies could play an important role in the age-related adjustment to stressors, as these factors can promote different control strategies. For example, when stressors become increasingly intractable in advanced old age, sadness responses (Nesse, 2000) and certain motivational tendencies (e.g., goal adjustment capacities or self-compassion) could protect psychological outcomes by fostering goal disengagement and self-protection. By contrast, anger responses to occurring stressors (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009) and other motivational tendencies (e.g., optimism or self-mastery) may serve adaptive functions to a greater extent in early old age, as they are likely to contribute to overcoming potentially manageable stressors. Given that they are partially independent factors that can exert similar behavioural functions, emotional responses and motivational tendencies may also work together and interact synergistically in predicting an age-adjusted use of control strategies and associated outcomes. In addition, we expect that age effects of both emotional responses and motivational tendencies will be enhanced among older adults who experience particularly severe stressors that are highly relevant to them (Heckhausen & Wrosch, 2016). Finally, we will include a self-protective writing intervention aimed at increasing adaptive goal disengagement strategies. This intervention is expected to prevent a deterioration of psychological outcomes particularly in advanced old age and should be effective especially among older adults who do not tend to react to intractable stressors with sadness or do not possess the motivational tendencies that support goal disengagement strategies. The study's hypotheses will be tested in four waves of data in a heterogeneous and longitudinal study of 150 adults in early old age (age 65-79) and 150 adults in advanced old age (age 80+). Each wave will include a general questionnaire and a 5-day daily assessment period to examine effects of relatively chronic and daily stress experiences. An intervention will be included in the same sample after wave 3 to examine whether adverse developmental outcomes can be changed. The main variables will assess participants' subjective and objective stress experiences, emotional responses, motivational tendencies, control strategy use, and psychological outcomes (well-being, lifestyle activity, and effective sleep). The study integrates and advances different theoretical accounts of life-span development (emotion, motivation, and inter-individual differences). The expected results are likely to discover novel pathways to successful development in early and advanced old age and can be used to improve older adults' quality of life.",0.1005125661375661,popul industri countri age individu advanc year repres fastest grow segment popul christensen advanc character increas experi psychosoci stressor difficulti goal attain life regret social loss compromis area psycholog function balt smith import adapt valu psycholog process older adult manag relat stressor think depend individu life phase associ relat declin control stressor heckhausen consequ propos research base premis individu earli advanc need optim psycholog outcom respond stress experi differ way theoret approach assum specif negat emot sad versus anger certain motiv tendenc play import role relat adjust stressor factor promot differ control strategi exampl stressor increas intract advanc sad respons ness certain motiv tendenc goal adjust capac self compass protect psycholog outcom foster goal disengag self protect contrast anger respons occur stressor carver harmon jone motiv tendenc optim self masteri serv adapt function greater extent earli like contribut overcom potenti manag stressor give partial independ factor exert similar behaviour function emot respons motiv tendenc work interact synergist predict adjust control strategi associ outcom addit expect effect emot respons motiv tendenc enhanc older adult experi particular sever stressor high relev heckhausen wrosch final includ self protect write intervent aim increas adapt goal disengag strategi intervent expect prevent deterior psycholog outcom particular advanc effect especi older adult tend react intract stressor sad possess motiv tendenc support goal disengag strategi studi hypothes test wave data heterogen longitudin studi adult earli adult advanc wave includ general questionnair daili assess period examin effect relat chronic daili stress experi intervent includ sampl wave examin advers development outcom chang main variabl assess particip subject object stress experi emot respons motiv tendenc control strategi psycholog outcom lifestyl activ effect sleep studi integr advanc differ theoret account life span develop emot motiv inter individu differ expect result like discov novel pathway success develop earli advanc improv older adult qualiti life,-1,"health, environment"
31,It takes two to tango: a couples approach to goal regulation in old age ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Christiane Hoppmann,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/109853,"Canada is experiencing a period of unprecedented socio-demographic change. Over the next ten years, the proportion of older adults is expected to double, making it essential to better understand how older adults may be able to continue pursuing valued goals and lead a meaningful life until late in life. To date, most aging research focuses on the individual. Yet, we, and others, have shown that key indicators of successful aging such as social engagement, well-being, and cognitive functioning are closely interrelated in couples. Embracing a social contextual perspective on aging, the proposed research extends previous aging models to couples to better understand the mechanisms that help older partners accomplish together what may not be possible alone. Goal-based aging models emphasize the need to distinguish between two qualitatively distinct processes that contribute to successful aging: engaging in the pursuit of valued goals and adjusting unattainable ones. These processes involve several different components: (a) selectively attending to goal-relevant information, (b) appraising a situation based on goals, (c) modifying behaviors to overcome problems with goal pursuit, and (d) disengaging from unfeasible goals. In extending this individual-focused model to couples, the proposed research aims to shed light on how older partners may be able to promote goal regulation across all four model components. Specifically, we distinguish between two ways in which partners may promote goal regulation in old age: (a) by creating a social context that strengthens individual resources, thereby allowing older adults to perform at their best (optimization) and (b) by directly getting involved when optimization does not suffice (compensation). We expect that partner self-validation is a particularly important mechanism that helps older adults optimize goal regulation. We further propose that partner collaborations are an effective means to compensate for age-normative resource limitations when optimization does not suffice. The proposed study uses an innovative combination and integration of experimental paradigms and repeated daily life assessments ('time-sampling') to address these research questions within the same sample. Specifically, 100 older couples will complete an experimental module on partner optimization, an experimental module on partner compensation, and ten days of simultaneous repeated daily life assessments from both spouses ('time-sampling') using a senior friendly iPad mini app. This approach will allow us to pinpoint the proposed causal mechanisms underlying partner optimization and compensation in goal regulation under controlled laboratory conditions. Combining lab and life will further help to examine the ecological validity of experimental findings, study the daily life dynamics underlying spousal goal regulation, and link them with time-varying indicators of well-being. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide a deeper, more complete understanding of the ways in which older partners can help each other to accomplish together what might be difficult to realize alone. Consequently, findings will lead to an advancement of knowledge from a scientific point of view.

32,"Quality of late life (QOLL): understanding and promoting adaptive psychological mindsets, physical engagement, and independence among older adults ( 2015/16-2019/20 )",Christiane Hoppmann,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107850,"Apocalyptic media accounts of the 'Aging Tsunami' sensationalize the destructive consequences of shifting age demographics. Yet, as more individuals live into their 8th and 9th decades of life and beyond, society will face daunting challenges due in part to an increase in their dependency. Nearly 40,000 Manitobans received home care services in 2011-12, and 4% of Canadian seniors report needing but not receiving care. Research is needed to facilitate the ""aging in place"" initiative that aims to extend the period during which individuals live independently in their own homes. The objectives of the proposed research are to contribute to scientific knowledge regarding how older people avoid functional dependency and remain resilient and to design a cognitive program to increase independence in late life. Guided by a highly regarded social cognition theory, the premise is that adaptive psychological mindsets (causal attributions) play a key role in fostering behavior that, in turn, promotes independence and quality of life. The behavior to be considered is everyday physical activity (EPA) that occurs in the day-to-day rhythm of life. EPA fosters daily social exchanges and small achievements that embellish a sense of personal control. Since the study of non-intense activity is overshadowed by research on vigorous physical activity and a ""more-is-better"" message, little is known about the consequences of EPA for independence. Our research is underpinned by a conceptual model featuring the psychological mindsets that govern EPA and the consequences for independence (Antecedents-EPA-Independence). A multi method approach will be used to analyze existing data and gather new data through field methods, focus groups, and an experimental pre-post design. Phase I will examine a representative sample of older community-dwelling adults whose EPA is assessed with objective accelerometers. The antecedents of EPA will include causal attributions, demographic, and contextual factors, and the consequences will include subjective (perceived needs) and objective (home care services, personal care living) indexes assessed over several years. Hypotheses will also examine moderators that may qualify the relationships and mediators (mechanisms) that may explain the relationships. This will generate scientific knowledge about the role of psychological mindsets in offsetting dependency and will also help to inform the design of a cognitive program to modify maladaptive attributions for inactivity. Phase II will design a program that will include individualized personalized visual feedback depicting participants' causal thinking profiles. Phase III will examine the program efficacy to test whether the treatment (vs. control) group experiences improvements in EPA and psychological independence. Phase IV will involve aggregating and synthesizing of knowledge to design the final program. The scholarly contributions will include creating new knowledge and a novel and comprehensive cognitive program to promote independence and foster resiliency. The application of attribution theory in a previously unexplored context will generate insights for clinical psychologists whose aim is to improve quality of life. Arming older adults with knowledge to foster adaptive thinking has the potential to forestall dependency and enable them to flourish. This also has implications for the informal care system, possibly reducing caregiver burden for middle-aged adults who provide care for loved ones, and offsetting financial strain in the formal care system that will accompany the escalating needs of our aging society. In doing so, our research will directly move knowledge into action in a way that can impact ""the intellectual, economic, and social fabric of society"".",0.047310606060606,apocalypt media account age tsunami sensation destruct consequ shift demograph individu live decad life societi face daunt challeng increas depend near manitoban receiv home care servic canadian senior report need receiv care research need facilit age place initi aim extend period individu live independ home object propos research contribut scientif knowledg older peopl avoid function depend remain resili design cognit program increas independ late life guid high regard social cognit theori premis adapt psycholog mindset causal attribut play role foster behavior turn promot independ qualiti life behavior consid everyday physic activ occur rhythm life foster daili social exchang small achiev embellish sens person control studi intens activ overshadow research vigor physic activ better messag littl know consequ independ research underpin conceptu model featur psycholog mindset govern consequ independ anteced independ multi method approach analyz exist data gather data field method focus group experiment post design phase examin repres sampl older communiti dwell adult assess object acceleromet anteced includ causal attribut demograph contextu factor consequ includ subject perceiv need object home care servic person care live index assess year hypothes examin moder qualifi relationship mediat mechan explain relationship generat scientif knowledg role psycholog mindset offset depend help inform design cognit program modifi maladapt attribut inact phase design program includ individu person visual feedback depict particip causal think profil phase examin program efficaci test treatment control group experi improv psycholog independ phase involv aggreg synthes knowledg design final program scholar contribut includ creat knowledg novel comprehens cognit program promot independ foster resili applic attribut theori previous unexplor context generat insight clinic psychologist improv qualiti life arm older adult knowledg foster adapt think potenti forestal depend enabl flourish implic inform care possibl reduc caregiv burden middl age adult provid care love one offset financi strain formal care accompani escal need age societi research direct knowledg action impact intellectu econom social fabric societi,-1,"health, environment"

Dementia increases the risk of nursing home placement among the elderly more than fivefold. Given the exceptionally vulnerable nature of this patient population, there is a pressing need to ensure that the clinical care they receive is evidence-based, tailored specifically for them, and meeting the high standards of quality that would be expected in any other health-care setting. Delirium is a sudden and severe change in brain function that can cause a person to appear confused or disoriented, have memory loss, and have difficulties maintaining focus. It is an urgent care issue facing elderly patients residing in nursing homes, or long-term care (LTC) facilities. Delirium is a significant cause of illness and mortality, affecting between 10%-89% of LTC patients, but little research has focused on delirium prevention in the LTC setting. This study will assess the effectiveness of a LTC Multicomponent Delirium Prevention Program (MDPP). The MDPP is an educational intervention provided to nursing staff working in LTC facilities that consists of four components: a decision tree, an instruction manual, a training package, and a toolkit. The feasibility and acceptability of the MDPP has already been successfully demonstrated; however, a thorough and well-designed large scale study is needed in order to confirm its ability to reduce delirium among LTC residents. In this study, at least 16 LTC facilities will be randomized to either receive the MDPP or to receive usual care. At the end of the 4-year study period, we will be able to demonstrate the degree to which the MDPP intervention reduces: 1) the number of new cases of delirium; 2) delirium severity; and 3) the duration of delirium episodes. This study will provide the blueprint of a program that can be transferable to LTC institutions across Canada.",0.0543029029793735,year million canadian expect alzheim diseas type dementia dementia increas risk nurs home placement elder fivefold give except vulner natur patient popul press need ensur clinic care receiv evid base tailor specif meet high standard qualiti expect health care set delirium sudden sever chang brain function caus person appear confus disori memori loss difficulti maintain focus urgent care issu face elder patient resid nurs home long term care facil delirium signific caus ill mortal affect patient littl research focus delirium prevent set studi assess effect multicompon delirium prevent program mdpp mdpp educ intervent provid nurs staff work facil consist compon decis tree instruct manual train packag toolkit feasibl accept mdpp success demonstr thorough design larg scale studi need order confirm abil reduc delirium resid studi facil random receiv mdpp receiv usual care year studi period abl demonstr degre mdpp intervent reduc number case delirium delirium sever durat delirium episod studi provid blueprint program transfer institut canada,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
34,Connecting local welfare networks ( 2011/12-2019/20 ),Yves Couturier,Université de Sherbrooke,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/106023,"This partnership brings together 27 university researchers, and 18 non-university researchers from 6 CSSS and 6 community roundtables in the social service sector in Quebec. The general objective of this partenrship is to bring researchers, practitioners and decision-makers together, across different social service sectors (e.g. elderly, children and youth, employability, work-family conciliation) and in different regions (different demographics, organizational configurations, governance procedures), to co-construct and share knowledge about networked service delivery and its dynamic interface with different family types.We will develop a new perspective on the « network society »: on its significance for the interface between public, private (market and family) and community actors in the field of social intervention; on the increasing formalization of networks of social intervention at the local level; and on the effects of this new mode of service delivery on professional practices and on family and individual well-being. Networks have become the hottest new vehicle for the delivery of social services, but do they work for local populations in need of help? Under what conditions, and for what purposes do they work best, or not well at all? How and why do they differ in structure and mode of operation from one region to another or from one sector of activity to another? Why are so many jurisdictions moving towards inter-sectoral, locally-based networks for service delivery and what are their effects on professional practices and on the service-user interface? The goals of the partnership are to structure sustainable opportunities for a full array of stakeholders to join forces with an 'epistemic community' of researchers, to explore these issues, to resolve the inherent problems of networked intervention, and to develop scientific and practical knowledge leading to improvements in intervention and well-being. We will capture and critically analyse emerging developments, benefiting from a ""natural experiment"" in the province of Quebec in which networking has become a ""required passage"" for the development of services in the public and community sectors, and collaborate with other Canadian partners to ""mobilize"" new knowledge and new practices in the social intervention field. With respect to knowledge mobilisation, the specific objectives are to deepen and renew understandings of social intervention networks by focusing on the co-construction of knowledge between researchers and partners from the intervention milieu; to increase the scientific and social impact of research related to social intervention networks, through the establishment and dissemination of knowledge tools; and to raise awareness and to influence practitioners, managers, decision-makers to question or transform their practices in the light of research results, through knowledge-sharing activities. A partnership or network approach is clearly essential for studying networks. It alone can foster the development of research and knowledge mobilization projects rooted in current, local concerns that that are relevant to local populations and practitioners; the emergence of a local ""knowledge culture"", encouraging innovation and improving the links between services and users; and the enhancement of responses within formal networks to the complex issues experienced by individuals, families and communities. The research and knowledge mobilisation projects developed in the framework of this partnership will contribute to the emergence of a new way of seeing and understanding network intervention, from the bottom up, and will produce results that are recognizable to the actors, and which therefore constitute accessible and actionable knowledge.",0.1043636363636363,partnership bring univers research univers research csss communiti roundtabl social servic sector quebec general object partenrship bring research practition decis maker differ social servic sector elder children youth employ work famili concili differ region differ demograph organiz configur govern procedur construct share knowledg network servic deliveri dynam interfac differ famili type develop perspect network societi signific interfac public privat market famili communiti actor field social intervent increas formal network social intervent local level effect mode servic deliveri profession practic famili individu network hottest vehicl deliveri social servic work local popul need help condit purpos work best differ structur mode oper region sector activ jurisdict move inter sector local base network servic deliveri effect profession practic servic user interfac goal partnership structur sustain opportun array stakehold join forc epistem communiti research explor issu resolv inher problem network intervent develop scientif practic knowledg lead improv intervent captur critic analys emerg develop benefit natur experi provinc quebec network requir passag develop servic public communiti sector collabor canadian partner mobil knowledg practic social intervent field respect knowledg mobilis specif object deepen renew understand social intervent network focus construct knowledg research partner intervent milieu increas scientif social impact research relat social intervent network establish dissemin knowledg tool rais awar influenc practition manag decis maker question transform practic light research result knowledg share activ partnership network approach clear essenti studi network foster develop research knowledg mobil project root current local concern relev local popul practition emerg local knowledg cultur encourag innov improv link servic user enhanc respons formal network complex issu experi individu famili communiti research knowledg mobilis project develop framework partnership contribut emerg see understand network intervent produc result recogniz actor constitut access action knowledg,-1,"health, environment"
35,Social ecologies of resilience and teen dating violence among indigenous and northern youth in the Northwest Territories ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),Charlotte J Loppie,University of Victoria,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107781,"Challenges and Issues: The highest rates of violence against women in Canada are in the Northern Territories. The Northwest Territories (NWT) has intimate partner violence (IPV) rates 7 times higher than the rest of Canada. Women who are younger and Aboriginal are disproportionately impacted by IPV. Violence against women is rooted in inequitable gender norms that devalue women and are reproduced in social values, roles, and behaviours. Aboriginal women's vulnerability to IPV is situated in historical and ongoing trauma from colonization and residential schools. In Canada young women aged 15-24 have the highest risk of teen dating violence (TDV), and these risks are highest in the Northern Territories. Scant research has explored protective factors that can reduce TDV risks among Aboriginal and Northern youth in the NWT. Goal and objective: The goals of this proposed 4-year project are to: a) better understand societal challenges of TDV, and build resilience, among Aboriginal and Northern youth in the NWT; b) contribute to theory building on social ecologies of resilience and TDV in the NWT; c) create and mobilize culturally relevant research knowledge. Specific objectives are to: a) explore experiences of TDV, gender norms, and resilience among Aboriginal and Northern youth in the NWT; b) examine social ecological factors associated with, and trajectories of, i) TDV risks and ii) resilience; c) promote intergenerational dialogue and knowledge mobilization on resilience and healthy relationships. Proposed Methodology: This Aboriginal research project addresses important issues (TDV, resilience), appropriate methods (land-based retreat, intergenerational dialogue), and theory (social ecological) identified by co-applicant Lys, a lifelong Northerner, Métis women, and Executive Director of collaborating partner FOXY. We use a transformative mixed-methods approach. Phase 1 (Preparation) will involve consultations with Elders and community leaders, and pilot-testing measures. Phase 2 (Arts-based Retreats) involves land-based retreats with youth and elders, intergenerational dialogue, focus groups, and digital storytelling to foster cultural knowledge transmission on resilience and healthy relationships. (Objectives 1,3). Phase 3 involves a prospective cohort study of Aboriginal and Northern youth in 4 locations (Yellowknife, Hay River, Inuvik, Fort Smith) with a survey at 3 time points (baseline, 12 and 24 month follow-up) to measure social ecological (intra/interpersonal, community, structural) factors associated with TDV and resilience. Longitudinal qualitative interviews will be held with purposively sampled participants (n=24) at 2 time points to explore social ecological factors associated with trajectories of resilience and TDV risks. (Objective 1,2). Phase 4 (Knowledge Mobilization) involves community forums, roundtables and a project toolkit. (Objective 3). Significance and Impacts: Our proposal addresses SSHRC's Future Challenge Area to: increase knowledge of traditional Indigenous values, cultures and knowledge systems; build capacity, with and for Aboriginal communities to benefit from research; and use creative arts to teach and preserve diverse Aboriginal heritage, memory and identity. This highly innovative project builds on our team's previous scholarship on Aboriginal youth, child and youth development, and violence to deepen understanding about social ecologies of TDV and resilience among Aboriginal and Northern youth in the NWT.

36,"NETOLNEW One mind, one people: working to understand and enhance Indigenous adults' contributions to reviving Indigenous languages in Canada ( 2016/17-2019/20 )",Charlotte J Loppie,University of Victoria,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/111443,"Challenge: NETOLNEW (translated as 'one mind, one people' or 'doing things as one' in the SENCOTEN language) is the central principle of this Partnership. Indigenous languages all over Canada are under severe threat. Leading scholars and community partners agree that Indigenous language revival is a pressing issue and should be of primary concern for communities and universities alike. To date, documenting Elder speakers, curriculum development and implementing school-based programs for preschool and K-12 children and youth have been the main foci of the Indigenous Language Revitalization (ILR) movement. Yet increasingly, adults are identified as the ""missing generation"" of learners who hold great potential to contribute to the revival of Indigenous languages in Canada by acting as the middle ground between Elders, children and youth within their communities. Goals and objectives: Our Partnership aims to address Indigenous adult language learning. However, because language learning in Indigenous communities cannot be studied in isolation, we have developed an approach that engages with, and studies, the spheres to which these adult learners are drawn. These include overlapping sites where Indigenous adults learn their language as well as sites where they are able to pass it on to others. We will: (i) deepen relationships and further clarify roles amongst and between the university team and community partners, thereby ensuring Indigenous goals are met and new knowledge flows to Indigenous communities; (ii) co-create and implement research that will benefit all partner communities in their aim to revive their languages, and allow multi-disciplinary university researchers to better understand adult Indigenous language learning as an important understudied component of the Indigenous language revitalization movement; (iii) document the knowledge created in this project; (iv) increase multi-disciplinary scholars' capacity to engage with and partner in research with Indigenous communities; (v) make this new knowledge more accessible to communities who are 'doing' the work, both our partners and other communities who are undertaking similar endeavors; (vi) ensure research training experiences for graduate and undergraduate students in the regions covered by the grant; (vii) enhance the flow of knowledge between and amongst scholars, policy-makers, and Indigenous communities while co-creating new multi-disciplinary knowledge for scholars and students addressing Indigenous language revitalization. Breadth of partnership, and meaningful engagement of partners: We have 9 confirmed Indigenous partners from across Canada, spanning BC, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Nova Scotia and NWT: six communities, two organizations (one provincial -- BC, one regional -- ON) and one Indigenous-controlled post-secondary institution. The diversity of, and distance between, our partner Indigenous language groups will be challenging, and necessarily require complex solutions to the reality of Indigenous language revitalization in Canada. The strong Indigenous partner connections and networks that exist, and will continue to build in this project, bring breadth and strength to this pan-Canadian partnership. Together we will work to achieve realistic language revitalization outcomes and develop a national network of those working at the core of Indigenous language revitalization. These endeavours will build capacity amongst Indigenous people and maximize the resources available to maintain, revitalize and strengthen efforts of nation-wide reconciliation and revitalization of the Indigenous languages of Canada.",0.1711174242424243,challeng netolnew translat mind peopl thing sencoten languag central principl partnership indigen languag canada sever threat lead scholar communiti partner agre indigen languag reviv press issu primari concern communiti univers alik date document elder speaker curriculum develop implement school base program preschool children youth main foci indigen languag revit movement increas adult identifi miss generat learner hold great potenti contribut reviv indigen languag canada act middl grind elder children youth communiti goal object partnership aim address indigen adult languag learn languag learn indigen communiti studi isol develop approach engag studi sphere adult learner draw includ overlap sit indigen adult learn languag sit abl pass deepen relationship clarifi role univers team communiti partner ensur indigen goal knowledg flow indigen communiti creat implement research benefit partner communiti reviv languag allow multi disciplinari univers research better understand adult indigen languag learn import understudi compon indigen languag revit movement document knowledg creat project increas multi disciplinari scholar capac engag partner research indigen communiti knowledg access communiti work partner communiti undertak similar endeavor ensur research train experi graduat undergradu student region cover grant enhanc flow knowledg scholar polici maker indigen communiti creat multi disciplinari knowledg scholar student address indigen languag revit breadth partnership meaning engag partner confirm indigen partner canada span alberta saskatchewan ontario nova scotia communiti organ provinci region indigen control post secondari institut divers distanc partner indigen languag group challeng necessarili requir complex solut realiti indigen languag revit canada strong indigen partner connect network exist continu build project bring breadth strength canadian partnership work achiev realist languag revit outcom develop nation network work core indigen languag revit endeavour build capac indigen peopl maxim resourc avail maintain revit strengthen effort nation wide reconcili revit indigen languag canada,-1,"health, environment"

Contexts of historical and ongoing racism, disconnection from culture and land, and intergenerational trauma contribute to these health disparities. Our past CIHR-funded research demonstrated the potential of Fostering Open eXpression among Youth (FOXY) and Strengths, Masculinities & Sexual Health (SMASH). FOXY and SMASH are arts-based, culturally grounded, strengths-focused and Indigenous-led sexual health programs to improve sexual health among Northern and Indigenous youth. We also found age, gender and sexual orientation differences in FOXY and SMASH outcomes, pointing to the need for mixed-methods research to further explore and address health needs and priorities of diverse youth in the NWT. OUR IDEA: We will first conduct qualitative research to understand how and why FOXY and SMASH work for improving sexual and reproductive health (SRH), for whom, and in what circumstance. We will then adapt FOXY and SMASH, and conduct a longitudinal cohort study with Northern and Indigenous youth in the NWT to explore trajectories of health and resilience. (1) We will work with a youth advisory board, youth, parents and Elders using human centred design approaches and community engagement to identify how to better meet the needs of youth.

En vieillissant, une personne sur trois est a risque d'etre isolee socialement. Heureusement, il est possible d'agir pour aider les aines a s'integrer plus facilement dans la communaute. En effet, les cliniciens, dont les ergotherapeutes, peuvent offrir un eventail d'interventions rentables pour ameliorer la vie sociale des aines. Par exemple, les ergotherapeutes peuvent batir des liens avec des ressources de la communaute ou offrir aux aines des interventions en groupe, en plus de les accompagner pour avoir une vie sociale saine et pleine de sens. Or, ces interventions sont peu offertes aux aines dans les services d'ergotherapie a domicile, notamment en raison d'un manque de partenariat.

42,Savings of the elderly: late-life-risks and bequest motives ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Daniel Barczyk,McGill University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113358,"Issues to be Addressed: Bequests have re-entered the public debate in the wake of the book ""Capital in the 21st century"" by French economist Thomas Piketty (2014). Piketty argues that bequests are an important driver of wealth inequality. This has led to an intensified debate on how bequests should be taxed. An important argument in favour of high estate taxation is that it would decrease wealth inequality and at the same time restore equality of opportunity by giving people more similar starting conditions. However, high estate taxes (just like taxes on capital), may discourage savings and thus lead to an inefficiently low capital stock. To understand the effects of estate taxes on the economy, however, we first need a firm grasp on the question: Why do people leave bequests? A different spin on this question is: Why do people leave bequests -- instead of transferring wealth to their children before they die? This is the first major issue our research project addresses: we aim to understand and quantify the motives that drive bequest and savings behaviour, and to understand the timing of intergenerational transfers. The second major issue our research addresses is to what extent estate taxation could ameliorate wealth inequality and what the consequences of such policies are on societal welfare. Is the estate tax an effective policy tool to tackle wealth inequality? Who are the winners and the losers? Contribution of Research: Surprisingly, the question of why people leave bequests is far from settled in the economics literature. Nonetheless, when studying issues surrounding the macroeconomy and public finance, economists typically must take a stand on the nature of why bequests occur, for example, that bequests are unintended, that they occur because of altruism, that they flow due to exchange reasons, that people value bequests like any other good, to point out the most common ones. However, a particular choice of bequest motive matters often in important ways, especially when studying policy reform that affects the elderly. To see this, consider an example of estate taxation. If bequests are entirely unintended (accidental), that is, people save only to insure themselves against unexpected expenditures, estate taxation would not distort savings behaviour. In contrast, if bequests are driven primarily by altruism, a tax on bequests would be similar to a tax on savings. The implications for the optimal tax policy would be very different. In reality, we would expect that bequest behaviour is driven by a combination of reasons, and one of the main contributions of this research is to understand this combination. Doing so will contribute to a better understanding of savings of the elderly by disentangling how much of their savings is explained by late-life-risks, by bequest motives, and how much is explained through their interaction. Through counterfactual policy experiments, our research will also enhance our understanding of how progressive estate taxation should be if a government's objective is to lessen the degree of wealth inequality. Wider Benefit of Research: Our research project will provide guidance to government agencies and practitioners concerned with wealth inequality and intergenerational fairness. It will also contribute to a long-standing debate in macroeconomics over the relative importance of different motives for saving, that is, to what extent wealth creation is attributable to intergenerational transfers and to what extent to life-cycle motives, see, for example, Kotlikoff and Summers (1981), Modigliani (1988), and Gale and Scholz (1994).",0.1247163120567376,issu address bequest enter public debat wake book capit centuri french economist thoma piketti piketti argu bequest import driver wealth inequ intensifi debat bequest tax import argument favour high estat taxat decreas wealth inequ time restor equal opportun give peopl similar start condit high estat tax like tax capit discourag save lead ineffici capit stock understand effect estat tax economi need firm grasp question peopl leav bequest differ spin question peopl leav bequest instead transfer wealth children major issu research project address understand quantifi motiv drive bequest save behaviour understand time transfer second major issu research address extent estat taxat amelior wealth inequ consequ polici societ welfar estat effect polici tool tackl wealth inequ winner loser contribut research surpris question peopl leav bequest settl econom literatur nonetheless studi issu surround macroeconomi public financ economist typic stand natur bequest occur exampl bequest unintend occur altruism flow exchang reason peopl valu bequest like good point common one particular choic bequest motiv matter import way especi studi polici reform affect elder consid exampl estat taxat bequest entir unintend accident peopl save insur unexpect expenditur estat taxat distort save behaviour contrast bequest drive primarili altruism bequest similar save implic optim polici differ realiti expect bequest behaviour drive combin reason main contribut research understand combin contribut better understand save elder disentangl save explain late life risk bequest motiv explain interact counterfactu polici experi research enhanc understand progress estat taxat govern object lessen degre wealth inequ wider benefit research research project provid guidanc govern agenc practition concern wealth inequ fair contribut long stand debat macroeconom relat import differ motiv save extent wealth creation attribut transfer extent life cycl motiv exampl kotlikoff summer modigliani gale scholz,-1,"health, environment"
43,Exploring and promoting older adults' inclusion in neighbourhoods ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Debbie Laliberte Rudman,Western University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112969,"This study will make important contributions to age-friendly communities by enhancing understanding of how and why older adults experience exclusion within their neighbourhoods and developing and implementing strategies that enhance inclusion amongst older residents. Given the growing numbers of older adults who are at risk of isolation and exclusion, promoting community inclusion in older Canadians is a priority across federal, provincial and municipal governments. Limited research exists regarding the processes of exclusion within neighbourhoods, including the complexities of person-place relationships as they shape inclusion and exclusion. As a result, a gap exists within age-friendly communities literature regarding applying such nuanced knowledge to create more inclusive communities. The proposed project will address these gaps and build new knowledge within 2 phases. In Phase 1 we will apply a new interdisciplinary research approach, developed in a previous Insight Development Grant (C Hand PI), to explore the complex processes by which inclusion and exclusion occur within neighbourhoods. The approach involves a collective ethnographic design and geo-spatial and narrative methods to explore participants' socially and historically situated experiences in neighbourhoods. We will explore how transactions between person and place shape older adults' possibilities for engagement with their physical and social neighbourhoods, focusing on activity participation, social engagement and community mobility. Participants will engage in narrative interviews, global positioning tracking, activity diaries, map and diary-based interviews, go-along interviews and group-based activity space mapping. We will target 3 neighbourhoods with characteristics that may challenge inclusion of older adults, including neighbourhoods 1) undergoing gentrification, 2) with lower socio-economic status and a significant ethnic minority population, and 3) with resources shifting from core to peripheral areas and a significant religious minority population. One neighbourhood will be identified as the demonstration site for Phase 2, in which stakeholders will become co-researchers to implement an iterative participatory action research cycle of reflecting, planning, acting, and observing, informed by the Phase 1 findings. We will collaboratively implement 2-4 feasible and sustainable neighbourhood strategies to promote the inclusion of older adults, mobilizing resources as needed. We will also evaluate this process and identify methods of evaluation appropriate to the local context. The proposed project will illuminate lived experiences, enhance awareness of the place-related needs of older adults, and advance theory regarding dimensions of inclusion and exclusion, including social, spatial, and activity dimensions. Via partnerships built or strengthened through this research, we will collaboratively identify ways to inform practices, services and programs that are implemented by government, community organizations, local business and community members, as they pertain to older adults' inclusion. Further, through plain language reports, presentations, publications, and media venues, we intend to work against the exclusion that many older adults experience and enhance awareness of the key role of place in these experiences and the implications for everyday life. The generated information can inform policy, service and neighbourhood re-configuration aimed at enhancing engagement, participation and inclusion of older adults. This information will also support a future, larger study aimed at creating neighbourhood change on a broader scale and better support the rights and abilities of aging Canadians to participate in their communities and societies.",0.1078375113258834,studi import contribut friend communiti enhanc understand older adult experi exclus neighbourhood develop implement strategi enhanc inclus older resid give grow number older adult risk isol exclus promot communiti inclus older canadian prioriti feder provinci municip govern limit research exist process exclus neighbourhood includ complex person place relationship shape inclus exclus result exist friend communiti literatur appli nuanc knowledg creat inclus communiti propos project address gap build knowledg phase phase appli research approach develop previous insight develop grant hand explor complex process inclus exclus occur neighbourhood approach involv collect ethnograph design spatial narrat method explor particip social histor situat experi neighbourhood explor transact person place shape older adult possibl engag physic social neighbourhood focus activ particip social engag communiti mobil particip engag narrat interview global posit track activ diari diari base interview interview group base activ space map target neighbourhood characterist challeng inclus older adult includ neighbourhood undergo gentrif lower socio econom status signific ethnic minor popul resourc shift core peripher area signific religi minor popul neighbourhood identifi demonstr site phase stakehold research implement iter participatori action research cycl reflect plan act observ inform phase find collabor implement feasibl sustain neighbourhood strategi promot inclus older adult mobil resourc need evalu process identifi method evalu appropri local context propos project illumin live experi enhanc awar place relat need older adult advanc theori dimens inclus exclus includ social spatial activ dimens partnership build strengthen research collabor identifi way inform practic servic program implement govern communiti organ local busi communiti member pertain older adult inclus plain languag report present public media venu intend work exclus older adult experi enhanc awar role place experi implic everyday life generat inform inform polici servic neighbourhood configur aim enhanc engag particip inclus older adult inform support futur larger studi aim creat neighbourhood chang broader scale better support right abil age canadian particip communiti societi,0,"health, environment"
44,Precarity and aging: unequal experiences in contemporary late life ( 2015/16-2019/20 ),Debbie Laliberte Rudman,Western University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/107840,"Overview: The proposed research focuses on understanding and accounting for precarity in late life. It explores the experiences of older people at three locations that mark inequality: older people with low income, older people who are foreign born, and older people with disabilities, and identifies policy and program measures that worsen or mitigate precarity. Background: The aging of societies is globally recognized, with governments focused on planning for the needs of their 'greying' populations. Yet, while there is growing evidence of precarity and rising inequality in late life, awareness tends to be obscured by the dominance of successful frameworks for aging. Although the impacts of precarity caused by labour and migration are well documented in earlier periods of the life course, research has overlooked late life precarity. Identifying and understanding precarity and aging requires research that considers how the contemporary combination of demographic change (i.e., longevity), longer lives, and reduced social safety nets, can alter the lives of older people, and the resources that are available to them. Our research explores precarious aging, and links older people's needs with an understanding of policy and community-based initiatives. It is thus, timely and relevant to academic scholarship, policy development, and community-based practice. Objectives: The proposed project will address three interrelated objectives: 1) To understand precarity and precarious trajectories in relation to contemporary aging, expected life course transitions, dominant success-based models of aging, public policies, and services; 2) To examine the adequacy of conceptual frameworks and approaches to precarity and inequality; and the interplay between structures, relationships, and experiences; 3) To assess features of local, provincial, national, and international policies to determine challenges, and identify key policy and programming changes that need to occur in order to mitigate precarity in late life. Methods: The proposed research explores precarity and aging at three levels of experience (low income older men and women; older people with disabilities; older people who are foreign born), social programming, and public policy. With varying and complementary expertise, our team is well-situated to explore these three analytic angles of inquiry of experience in two distinct geographic regions (SW Ontario- including Hamilton and London; and BC-Vancouver), and to carry out policy analysis and conceptual work that spans national and international contexts. Our investigative methods include: a) a conceptual review of precarity and related concepts; b) semi-structured interviews with key informants; c) in-depth interviews with older people at three precarious locations (low income, immigration, disability); d) analysis of statistical/administrative data; and e) policy review, document analysis and one-to-one interviews. Significance and Impact: This study is unique in bridging conceptual scholarship and applied social research in order to better understand and address the needs of older people with precarious trajectories, and suggest directions for policy change. Results will make substantial contributions to knowledge in social gerontology, and our respective disciplines of social work, occupational therapy, sociology and political science. Research findings will inform classroom teaching, public knowledge through plain language summaries, and identify areas to aid the development of specialized policies and community-based programs that mitigate precarity in late life. The program will contribute to a larger aim of better addressing the unique needs of a diverse range of older people in Canada.",0.0747354497354497,overview propos research focus understand account precar late life explor experi older peopl locat mark inequ older peopl incom older peopl foreign bear older peopl disabl identifi polici program measur worsen mitig precar background age societi global recogn govern focus plan need grey popul grow evid precar rise inequ late life awar tend obscur domin success framework age impact precar caus labour migrat document earlier period life cours research overlook late life precar identifi understand precar age requir research consid contemporari combin demograph chang longev longer live reduc social safeti net alter live older peopl resourc avail research explor precari age link older peopl need understand polici communiti base initi time relev academ scholarship polici develop communiti base practic object propos project address interrel object understand precar precari trajectori relat contemporari age expect life cours transit domin success base model age public polici servic examin adequaci conceptu framework approach precar inequ interplay structur relationship experi assess featur local provinci nation intern polici determin challeng identifi polici program chang need occur order mitig precar late life method propos research explor precar age level experi incom older women older peopl disabl older peopl foreign bear social program public polici vari complementari expertis team situat explor analyt angl inquiri experi distinct geograph region ontario includ hamilton london vancouv carri polici analysi conceptu work span nation intern context investig method includ conceptu review precar relat concept semi structur interview inform depth interview older peopl precari locat incom immigr disabl analysi statist administr data polici review document analysi interview signific impact studi uniqu bridg conceptu scholarship appli social research order better understand address need older peopl precari trajectori suggest direct polici chang result substanti contribut knowledg social gerontolog respect disciplin social work occup therapi sociolog polit scienc research find inform classroom teach public knowledg plain languag summari identifi area develop special polici communiti base program mitig precar late life program contribut larger better address uniqu need divers rang older peopl canada,-1,"health, environment"
45,Improving Depression Screening in Geriatric Patients by Reducing Bias and Generating Individualized Accuracy Estimates: An Individual Patient Data Meta-Analysis of the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),Machelle Wilchesky,McGill University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/181609,"Major depression is common among elderly Canadians. Depression screening, which involves using short questionnaires to identify people who may have unrecognized depression, has been suggested as a way to improve the detection, management and treatment of depression. Some organizations recommend depression screening for elderly adults, but screening is not currently recommended in Canada's main healthcare guidelines due to concerns that screening tools do not accurately distinguish between patients with and without depression. Another concern with existing screening methods is that they do not do consider patient risk factors such as age, sex, care setting, and medical diagnoses, which may be associated with depression. Instead, they simply classify patients as either ""likely"" or ""not likely"" to be depressed. In our project, we will combine original patient data from published studies that used the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) depression screening tool, in order to create a very large database that can be used to determine more accurate ways to identify elderly patients with depression. The project will allow us to determine the probability that a specific elderly patient is depressed by considering the patient's individual depression score along with specific patient characteristics (e.g., age, sex, care setting, medical diagnosis). To implement our findings, we will develop a free online calculator that will allows healthcare professionals to use the results of our research with their patients in clinical practice. This project will improve the effectiveness of depression screening in the elderly, which depends on accurate screening questionnaires. In collaboration with Canadian guideline-makers, findings from this project will be applied in hospitals and health clinics to facilitate effective depression screening programs, improve the management of depression, and set Canada apart as a leader in depression research and practice.",0.1112060041407867,major depress common elder canadian depress screen involv short questionnair identifi peopl unrecogn depress suggest improv detect manag treatment depress organ recommend depress screen elder adult screen current recommend canada main healthcar guidelin concern screen tool accur distinguish patient depress concern exist screen method consid patient risk factor care set medic diagnos associ depress instead simpli classifi patient like like depress project combin origin patient data publish studi geriatr depress scale depress screen tool order creat larg databas determin accur way identifi elder patient depress project allow determin probabl specif elder patient depress consid patient individu depress score specif patient characterist care set medic diagnosi implement find develop free onlin calcul allow healthcar profession result research patient clinic practic project improv effect depress screen elder depend accur screen questionnair collabor canadian guidelin maker find project appli hospit health clinic facilit effect depress screen program improv manag depress canada apart leader depress research practic,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

( 2020/21 ),Sharon E Straus,University of Toronto,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231768,"Depression is the single most common mental illness in older adults and it leads to significant struggle day to day. Older adults experiencing depressive symptoms, such as low mood, are often under treated. One reason for under treatment is difficulty accessing treatment. Social isolation worsens low mood, and many other symptoms of depression. There are virtual or telemedicine approaches using phones or computers, that healthcare providers can use to provide treatments for depression in older adults. During the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are even more socially isolated and less able to seek care. This vicious cycle contributes to poor outcomes for society's most vulnerable members. Our goal is to determine what telemedicine strategies are available for older adults with depression, and which are most effective in reducing symptoms. We will do this by reviewing all the existing studies in scientific research. Through analysing these studies we will be able to determine which treatments work best for patients. Knowing which treatments are best will allow us to inform patients, doctors, and health care teams how to best use these services to help reduce the burden of depression in older adults.",0.1962053571428571,depress singl common mental ill older adult lead signific struggl older adult experi depress symptom mood treat reason treatment difficulti access treatment social isol worsen mood symptom depress virtual telemedicin approach phone comput healthcar provid provid treatment depress older adult covid pandem older adult social isol abl seek care vicious cycl contribut poor outcom societi vulner member goal determin telemedicin strategi avail older adult depress effect reduc symptom review exist studi scientif research analys studi abl determin treatment work best patient know treatment best allow inform patient doctor health care team best servic help reduc burden depress older adult,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
47,"Economic impact of falls prevention interventions: We know the ""value"", but what about the ""value for money""? ( 2019/20-2020/21 )",Sharon E Straus,University of Toronto,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/213308,"RATIONALE: Falls have a substantial impact on the quality of life, morbidity, and mortality of older adults, and are costly for our healthcare system. Many falls prevention interventions have proven to be effective. With constrained healthcare resources, the most effective intervention is not always cost-effective, and we are often faced with determining whether an intervention is truly worth the resources it requires. Therefore, in addition to answering the question ""does the intervention work?"", decision- and policy-makers must also answer the 'value for money' question, ""is it cost-effective?"". OBJECTIVE: Members of our team previously conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis on falls prevention interventions. This project will examine the cost-effectiveness of effective falls prevention interventions identified through our previous work. Our findings will help identify falls prevention interventions that are not only effective but also cost-effective. METHODS: We will develop a health economics model to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each falls prevention intervention from the perspective of public healthcare payers, using data from our previous work and published literature. We will explore factors that influence the interventions' cost-effectiveness and conduct subgroup analyses by factors such as history of falls. IMPACT: Information on the cost-effectiveness of falls prevention interventions will assist policy-makers to make informed decisions on which intervention they should fund and implement. Our findings will provide evidence on both the value for money and budget impact of falls prevention interventions to decision-makers who fund these interventions and to those who are considering their implementation, namely our colleagues from Department of Medicine at the University of Toronto, Alberta Health Services, the Regional Geriatrics Program of Toronto, Osteoporosis Canada, and the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care.",0.2244444444444444,rational fall substanti impact qualiti life morbid mortal older adult cost healthcar fall prevent intervent prove effect constrain healthcar resourc effect intervent cost effect face determin intervent truli worth resourc requir addit answer question intervent work decis polici maker answer valu money question cost effect object member team previous conduct systemat review network meta analysi fall prevent intervent project examin cost effect effect fall prevent intervent identifi previous work find help identifi fall prevent intervent effect cost effect method develop health econom model evalu cost effect fall prevent intervent perspect public healthcar payer data previous work publish literatur explor factor influenc intervent cost effect conduct subgroup analys factor histori fall impact inform cost effect fall prevent intervent assist polici maker inform decis intervent fund implement find provid evid valu money budget impact fall prevent intervent decis maker fund intervent consid implement colleagu depart medicin univers toronto alberta health servic region geriatr program toronto osteoporosi canada ontario ministri health long term care,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
48,A prospective randomized controlled trial comparing operative versus non-operative management of patella fractures in the elderly ( 2019/20 ),Gurrattan Chandhoke,St. Michael's Hospital,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215573,"Operative management is indicated for all displaced patellar fractures in young and active patients. While this is widely agreed upon, surgical indications for elderly patients with displaced fractures remains controversial. Elderly patients often have an intact extensor mechanism due to the low-energy mechanism of their injury. Treatment indications are further complicated by the frequent presence of other health problems, poor bone quality for repair, and lower functional demands. There is a lack of high level scientific demonstrating that the benefits of surgery significantly outweigh the risks in this patient population. Non-operative management may result in equivalent outcomes, while avoiding the risks associated with surgery, such as infection or the need for further surgery. In fact, previous studies of other injuries in orthopaedics have demonstrated precisely this. Given an increasing elderly Canadian population, the incidence of low-energy patellar fractures is expected to rise substantially in the future. Therefore, defining the optimal treatment of these injuries is of significant importance. Minimizing complications while ensuring a rapid return of function and independence in this vulnerable population is critical. Our study is a multi-centered, prospective, randomized controlled trial across North America. Elderly (>65 years), low-demand patients will be randomized into operative or non-operative management with a standardized post-treatment protocol.

49,IT innovation and elderly: technology acceptance and use in the community ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Guy Paré,HEC Montréal,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110297,"Limited research in Information Systems (IS) has focused on technology and seniors who are often not part of the workforce, and not included in studies focusing on business units and organizations (McMurtrey et al., 2011). With the projected increase in the proportion of elderly in the society as the baby boomers move into retirement (Statistics Canada, 2016), and since seniors represent a financially secure market, it is important to understand their behavior in relation to technology. Information technologies (IT) present tools that may support the long-term needs of seniors, and recently we have witnessed a proliferation of consumer applications (Agarwal et al., 2010), which may enable new forms of interactions for them. Yet, little is known about Canadian seniors in relation to technology use, and the factors that may affect it. Grounded in the life course theory (Elder & Rockwell, 1979; Elder Jr, 1974, 1999) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) (Venkatesh et al., 2012), this research uses a multiple methodology approach to answer the questions: What is the attitude and behavior of seniors in Canada in relation to technology and IT solutions that may support their needs in the community? What are the factors that affect the acceptance and use of specific consumer applications by seniors? What is the perception of seniors regarding the role of technology in addressing the challenges they face? In study #1, we plan to conduct a pan-Canadian survey of seniors that assesses their technology-related behavior based on dimensions and measures developed by McMurtrey et al (2011), and used in the context of seniors in the U.S. In addition, we will investigate on a [1-7] Likert scale the use of consumer technologies that have been discussed in the literature in relation to seniors including: home-based monitoring systems (e.g., fall detection systems, TM applications), wearable technologies (e.g., smart watches), and general e-health applications (e.g., making appointments, online support groups) (Czaja, 2016; de Veer et al., 2015). The national sample will include 1,500 seniors, selected based on quotas, which ensure representativeness of the actual distribution of the population in Canada. Study #2 focuses on a specific group of consumer applications related to telemonitoring technologies, which have been provider-driven and highly diffused, and investigates the factors that affect the acceptance and use of these technologies by seniors. Specifically, we will test the UTAUT2 in the context of these consumer applications by surveying seniors living at the Perley and Rideau Veteran's Health Centre (PRVHC), a not-for-profit centre for healthy living, serving 600 seniors in the community. The PRVHC will provide access to its facilities to survey the residents, and the instrument measures will be adapted from Venkatesh et al (2012) for the context of this research. Quantitative analyses will be performed to identify significant associations. Last, we propose to adopt a focus group technique, as an adjunct to the quantitative approaches used in the first two studies, to gain a better understanding of the needs and perceptions of seniors regarding the role of technology in addressing challenges they face or may be confronted with in the future. We will also explore staff's attitudes and needs as to the role of technology in supporting seniors and their care.

The prevalence of youth-onset T2D in Manitoba is the highest among the provinces in Canada. The majority of youth-onset T2D in Manitoba lives in rural or remote FN communities. Breastfeeding initiation reduced the risk of diabetes in mothers and their children. Breastfeeding is the traditional method of FN people for feeding babies, but the rate of breastfeeding is low in FN communities. FN women in rural or remote communities have less access to prenatal and breastfeeding education compared to urban women due to geographic, socioeconomic and historical factors. Gut bacteria in infants play important roles in growth and the development of obesity, T2D and the beneficial effects of breastfeeding. The disorders of gut bacteria may be implicated in the high prevalence of T2D in rural-living FN children. The proposed study will partner with community Elders to educate FN pregnant women and their family members with traditional and modern knowledge on the importance of a healthy diet, breast milk, and the role of gut bacteria in the development of obesity and diabetes. We will examine the impact of breastfeeding on infant gut bacteria and the relationship with breastfeeding and infant growth with supports from Elders and community assistants. The results will help to guide breastfeeding and mother's food intake. We have invited FN Elders, healthcare workers and researchers to join the research team. FN people and their traditions will be respected. The privacy of participants will be protected. The FN communities and participants will have the ownership and the control of the data.

In our recent Canadian Institutes of Health Research Indigenous diabetes/obesity study, three urban/rural BC Friendship Centres (FC) (Kelowna, Vernon, Williams Lake), local community members and research teams (researchers, Indigenous/non-Indigenous health providers, community members, Elders, Traditional Healers, and youth) identified healthcare gaps: access to healthcare, Traditional knowledge and practices, education in cultural safety, food security, nutrition, exercise, and cultural activities).

53,"Entre hospices et manoirs de l'âge d'or : le bien vieillir au Québec, 1921-1971 ( 2016/17-2019/20 )",Aline Charles,Laval University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110047,"Dans le Québec du 20e siècle comme ailleurs en Occident, hospices, foyers et résidences du 3e âge sont de plus en plus dédiés à la vieillesse. Parallèlement, « bien vieillir » prend la force d'une injonction qui oriente les politiques publiques, façonne les pratiques des spécialistes, alimente un « marché de la vieillesse » et anime le mouvement du 3e âge. Elle résonne dans les établissements pour personnes âgées, modulant ou réfutant l'ancienne image des mouroirs pour vieilles et vieux démunis. C'est à cette transformation, fort peu documentée, que ce projet sera consacré. La période considérée s'ouvre en 1921 sur la loi québécoise de l'Assistance publique qui stimule le développement des infrastructures d'hébergement. Elle englobe les décennies 1940, 1950 et 1960 alors que des « manoirs de l'âge d'or » à but lucratif ouvrent leurs portes. Au passage, elle embrasse la généralisation en Occident d'une vieillesse institutionnalisée. Elle se clôt enfin, au seuil des années 1970, sur les critiques de ce modèle qui favorisent plutôt les services à domicile et la mise à contribution des familles. L'ensemble saisit ainsi un demi-siècle durant lequel s'impose un modèle du bien vieillir en institution, une sorte d'âge d'or des établissements collectifs de la vieillesse qui décerne au Québec l'un des taux d'institutionnalisation les plus élevés au monde. Ce projet propose d'offrir un éclairage historique sur des enjeux de l'heure tout en ouvrant de nouvelles pistes de recherche. Un premier objectif consiste à établir le portrait étonnamment méconnu des Québécois-es âgés qui vivent en institution de 1921 à 1971 et des établissements qui les hébergent. On peut avancer que ces populations réputées peu nombreuses, pauvres, âgées et majoritairement féminines au 19e siècle composent, après 1921, des clientèles plus importantes, plus aisées, plus jeunes, plus masculines, et donc plus variées. On peut aussi penser que les infrastructures d'hébergement se développent et se diversifient, à mesure que s'y affirme la possibilité de bien vieillir. Un deuxième objectif vise à vérifier l'instauration d'un consensus social autour de l'institutionnalisation de la vieillesse. L'analyse examinera comment les établissements pour personnes âgées deviennent un secteur d'intervention pour l'Église et l'État, un nouveau champ d'expertise pour plusieurs professionnels-les, un marché à développer pour des entrepreneurs-es, un objet de revendications pour les pensionnaires et les groupes du 3e âge, un objet de préoccupation sociale dont la presse écrite se fait l'écho. Un dernier objectif souhaite situer le cas québécois au sein d'évolutions qui ont, en fait, une portée internationale : l'institutionnalisation de la vieillesse se déploie à l'échelle occidentale, soulevant au Québec et ailleurs des enjeux à la fois similaires et distincts. La démarche retenue tient compte du poids persistant au 20e siècle des logiques institutionnelles de domination et de dépersonnalisation, mais sans s'y limiter. Attentive aux différents acteurs impliqués, elle propose de donner voix aux résidants-es âgés eux-mêmes. Sans traiter les établissements comme des espaces clos, elle saisit leurs interactions avec un vaste ensemble d'intervenants. Enfin, elle postule que l'âge, le genre et l'appartenance sociale structurent tant l'institutionnalisation que le modèle du bien vieillir. La documentation comprend recensements, documents officiels, archives d'institutions, testaments de personnes âgées en faveur d'un établissement, presse, publications professionnelles et internationales, fonds du 3e âge. Campé au milieu d'un 20e siècle qui bouleverse les conceptions du vieillir, ce projet entend ainsi explorer une forme cruciale de prise en charge du vieil âge : son institutionnalisation.",0.2166666666666666,dan québec siècl comm ailleur occid hospic foyer résidenc sont plus plus dédié vieilless parallèl bien vieillir prend forc injonct orient politiqu publiqu façonn pratiqu spécialist aliment marché vieilless anim mouvement ell résonn dan établiss pour personn âgées modul réfutant ancienn imag mouroir pour vieill vieux démuni cett transform fort documenté projet sera consacré périod considéré ouvr québécois assist publiqu stimul développ infrastructur hébergement ell englob décenni alor manoir lucratif ouvrent leur port passag ell embrass généralis occid vieilless ell clôt enfin seuil anné critiqu modèl favoris plutôt servic domicil mise contribut famill ensembl saisit ainsi demi siècl durant lequel impos modèl bien vieillir institut sort établiss collectif vieilless décern québec taux plus élevé mond projet propos offrir éclairag historiqu enjeux heur tout ouvrant nouvell pist recherch premier objectif consist établir portrait étonnam méconnu québécoi âgés vivent institut établiss hébergent peut avanc popul réputé nombreus pauvr âgées majoritair féminin siècl compos aprè clientèl plus important plus aisé plus jeun plus masculin donc plus varié peut aussi penser infrastructur hébergement développ diversifi mesur affirm possibilité bien vieillir deuxièm objectif vise vérifier instaur consensus social autour vieilless analys examinera comment établiss pour personn âgées devienn secteur intervent pour église état nouveau champ expertis pour plusieur professionnel marché développ pour entrepreneur objet revend pour pensionnair group objet préoccup social dont press écrite fait écho dernier objectif souhait situer québécoi sein évolut fait porté international vieilless déploie échell occidental soulev québec ailleur enjeux foi similair distinct démarch retenu tient compt poid persist siècl logiqu domin mai san limit attent différent acteur impliqué ell propos donner voix résidant âgés mêmes san traiter établiss comm espac clos ell saisit leur interact avec vast ensembl interven enfin ell postul genr apparten social structur tant modèl bien vieillir document comprend recens document officiel archiv institut testament personn âgées faveur établiss press public international fond campé milieu siècl boulevers concept vieillir projet entend ainsi explor form crucial prise charg vieil,-1,"health, environment"

Working together, SMILE will put the seniors and their caregivers at the center of design by understanding their needs and preferences. This feedback will be used to make smart living environments with artificial intelligence solutions to support ageing people by addressing their specific problems and needs. The Canadian study will specifically use a device called Vitaliti-a light weight device worn around the neck that can monitor seniors' vital signs and heart beat continually, while they go about their day. This observational study (VISION-2) will be conducted with 900 patients who have surgery and are at risk for serious complications. We will use a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning to study these readings. We will look for slight changes in vital signs that may lead to heart muscle injury, bleeding and infection. Once we know what these signs are, we can then develop an alert system to warn us so we can stop the complications before they happen. We will then look at how effective this alert system can be in 100 patients who will be assigned at random to wear the Vitaliti device or not for the first 30 days after surgery. At present, seniors die from infection and other serious complications after surgery- this work is an opportunity to make a real difference. Currently, few structures in current healthcare systems across the EU and Canada support seniors in dealing with unfavorable outcomes related to the ageing process. With SMILE, the hope is to develop age-friendly innovations that are accepted by the ageing population and their care teams.

The team has worked with the three communities for almost twenty years, and, having very well established, trusted, and respectful relationships, has been asked to address the communities' concerns. For residents of remote NT communities, basic health services are provided through a nurse-based primary care model, supported by visiting doctors and telehealth services. Residents who require more than basic primary care must travel to services that are only available in regional centres, or in southern provinces. Accessing these services can involve lengthy wait times, as well as long distance travel and time away from home communities, family, and social support networks for weeks at a time. In this project, the communities of Yellowknife, Inuvik, and Fort Good Hope with a Community Advisory Board and the team plan to: 1) Gather community members' perspectives via sharing circles using Two-Eyed Seeing to improve access and availability of healthcare services; 2) Develop, implement, and evaluate a community-driven and community-led program to improve access to and experience with health services that will take place on-the-land and alongside Elders, traditional knowledge holders, and healers; and 3) Share materials and all findings with community, territorial, and national organizations, as well as healthcare providers and policymakers to ensure culturally appropriate health service delivery.

A ce lourd tribut, s'ajoute la menace d'une deuxieme vague, deja debutee dans plusieurs juridictions. Les mesures de sante publique qui reduisent les contacts avec les professionnels, les familles et proches aidants, emmurent les ESLD. Ce contexte particulier, qui inclut la restriction des visites, approfondit l'isolement et la solitude des personnes agees (PA), notamment en contexte minoritaire. Ces effets collateraux vulnerabilisant pour les PA, non anticipes dans la riposte, sont aujourd'hui fortement vecus par les ESLD. Cette situation unique et alarmante oblige les ESLD a developper des pratiques prometteuses pour le present et les futures eclosions et assurer le maintien du capital social entre les PA et leurs familles et proches aidants, de meme qu'avec le personnel, pour briser l'isolement et la solitude. Au Quebec, le tiers des infections de la COVID-19 a concerne le personnel de la sante. Les ESLD, cadre par excellence d'eclosions saisonnieres (ex. grippe), fonctionne deja avec un effectif insuffisant, epuise et apeure par l'infection. La grande majorite de ESLD n'integre pas les technologies numeriques de facon optimale pour soutenir le personnel. Nul n'etait prepare au defi de la COVID-19, mais les innovations mises en oeuvre jusqu'a maintenant indiquent des ilots de succes, des pratiques gagnantes que notre projet va capitaliser, en se concentrant sur les minorites linguistico-culturelles (ESLD anglophones du Quebec et francophones du Manitoba et du Nouveau-Brunswick). En effet, peu d'initiatives concernant la COVID-19 sont rapportees aupres de ces populations et la situation pourrait etre plus difficile chez les PA en contexte de minorite linguisticoculturelle qui rencontrent ordinairement des defis dans l'acces au systeme de sante. Vu le nombre tres limite de ESLD dedies a ces populations minoritaires dans les provinces, les familles et proches se trouvent souvent loin geographiquement, voire dans d'autres provinces du pays, les solutions numeriques apparaissent particulierement pertinentes.

Even with optimal treatment, people with COPD frequently experience exacerbations or worsening of their condition and need admission to hospital. Wearable technology such as smartwatches may be able to accurately monitor physiologic parameters such as coughing, heart rate and physical activity which may change with exacerbations of COPD. These parameters may both be able to accurately detect early acute exacerbations but also engage patients in their condition. We have developed a smartwatch application that records physical activity, heart rate, and respiratory sounds such as coughing. Our feasibility study found older patients with COPD will wear them, and we can collect accurate information data from the smartwatch sensors such as coughing. To achieve our goal of improving the care of patients with COPD, we will design, build and evaluate an e-Health application that will help patients with COPD manage their condition. This app will help patients monitor their physiologic parameters and will provide guidance for COPD self-management, including what actions to take when a COPD exacerbation occurs. This mobile application will also try to persuade patients with COPD to adopt healthier behaviour such as increasing their physical activity or stopping smoking. It will also be a platform to communicate with their health care provider. From our experience to date, elderly patients with COPD want to take control of their health. Paired with our smartwatch application, an e-Health app may improve their self-management and help them manage their COPD exacerbations earlier and at home. This would reduce the negative and costly experience of requiring a hospital admission.

We believe this means that many patients are now receiving non-benzodiazepine sedatives (such as zopiclone, trazodone, and antipsychotics) when they leave the hospital because care providers believe they are safer drugs. However, some of these newer non-benzodiazepine sedative drugs now have Health Canada warnings due to concerns of mental impairment and falls. This study will assess the important knowledge gap regarding changes in the type of sedatives used following hospitalization for critical illness and the impact of these drugs on important patient outcomes such as falls, fractures, emergency room visits, rehospitalisation, and death. Our team of critical care and primary care experts will fill this gap by conducting a large study of elderly critically ill patients using Ontario healthcare databases (2003-2017) that includes information on healthcare encounters and outpatient prescriptions for those over 65 years old. The findings from this study will be used to help identify which sedatives create the largest risk for elderly patients and allow for better guidelines regarding safe prescribing.",0.0920749704840614,patient hospit especi critic prescrib sedat drug help toler procedur sleep anxieti agit delirium idea short term sedat acut ill drug continu discharg hospit elder patient communiti benzodiazepin sedat risk fall emerg room visit guidelin care critic patient suggest benzodiazepin sedat instead benzodiazepin believ mean patient receiv benzodiazepin sedat zopiclon trazodon antipsychot leav hospit care provid believ safer drug newer benzodiazepin sedat drug health canada warn concern mental impair fall studi assess import knowledg chang type sedat follow hospit critic ill impact drug import patient outcom fall fractur emerg room visit death team critic care primari care expert conduct larg studi elder critic patient ontario healthcar databas includ inform healthcar encount outpati prescript year find studi help identifi sedat creat largest risk elder patient allow better guidelin safe prescrib,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

Lab data, animal models and early clinical data suggest that a drug commonly used to treat HIV, called Kaletra, may have activity against COVID-19 and its closely related ""cousin"" coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. Kaletra is currently being tested in clinical trials in China for treatment. This drug has been safely used for over two decades in HIV treatment and also in post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) for un-infected people with high-risk exposures. We propose a study that will address the immediate need for prevention interventions by testing whether or not giving Kaletra PEP to contacts exposed to COVID-19 will stop them from getting the disease. We expect to test this in three key groups of exposed contacts: the frail elderly in nursing/retirement homes, frontline health workers, and household/community contacts. Our trial employs a commonly used approach in vaccination studies called a ring design, which also allows us to collect detailed information about the natural history of the infection in exposed contacts. In addition to testing the effectiveness of our specific intervention, the master protocols and procedures developed can be used to test other prevention interventions including both medications and vaccines, once they become available. This ring design was a key part of the successful eradication of smallpox, and the evaluation of the vaccine used for Ebola. We will identify a ring of exposed close contacts around index cases and randomize these rings to a 14-day course of Kaletra PEP or a placebo control and will test contacts systematically to see if they develop COVID-19.

At the same time that we are expected to live longer, there has been a proliferation of digital devices, information technologies and mediated systems of communication that network populations globally. How ageing populations, and those in later life, are experiencing a world that is increasingly mediated by the proliferation of digital devices is the primary focus of our partnership. OBJECTIVES: Ageing, Communication, Technologies (ACT) addresses the transformation of the experiences of ageing with the proliferation of new forms of mediated communications in networked societies. It considers how 'digital ageism' -the individual and systemic biases that create forms of inclusion and exclusion that are age-related- operates in subtle ways, and suggests strategies for change. Our objectives are to: transform public discourses and understandings of age and ageing; include older adults as active agents and collaborators in our research agenda to develop appropriate languages, methods and ways to communicate intergenerationally and intra-generationally; develop curricula and teaching methods; provide a lasting collaborative platform for the theorization and critical analysis of the relationship between ageing and digital worlds; draw on the interdisciplinary expertise of our researchers who are working in a wide range of national and transnational settings; foster an inter-institutional sharing of resources and expertise on ageing and media for students, faculty, community workers and selected industry partners; and finally to create strong institutional partnerships and connections across academic institutions and non-academic organizations likewise concerned. RESEARCH TOPICS and METHODS: 'ACT' points to the research that will be undertaken within three inter-related areas: 1) 'Agency in Ageing: Collaborative Creativity and the Digital Arts in Later Life' involves communities in the development of projects that have scholarly and creative outcomes to enhance agency. 2) 'Critical Mediations: Everyday Life and Cultures of Ageing' examines the variegated mediated cultural experiences of adults in later life. 3) 'Telecommunication Technologies: Ageing in Networked Societies' investigates ageing in the context of networked societies. It is primarily conducted through methodologies associated with the social sciences, and bridges internet and telecommunications research with ageing studies. PROCESS and RESULTS: The creation of a vibrant platform for collaborative research and institutional exchange across disciplines and sectors will be fulfilled through six types of activities:1) yearly face-to-face network meetings, 2) pilot projects, or case studies, that instigate new research questions, concepts and knowledge production, create internal exchange and produce further international research, publications and partnered events, 3) summer schools and opportunities for research exchange for faculty and students at the graduate and post-graduate level, 4) collaborative exhibitions and public research events, 5) 'virtual seminars' webcast to the network, and made public through Concordia and institutional partners, 6) collaborative co-production of a robust website for the dissemination of research results, and where web resources (bibliographies, publications, reports, links to other networks, upcoming events) are posted.",0.0469168428470754,premis world popul age peopl expect decad make senior citizen largest demograph group western world time expect live longer prolifer digit devic inform technolog mediat system communic network popul global age popul later life experi world increas mediat prolifer digit devic primari focus partnership object age communic technolog address transform experi age prolifer form mediat communic network societi consid digit ageism individu system bias creat form inclus exclus relat oper subtl way suggest strategi chang object transform public discours understand age includ older adult activ agent collabor research agenda develop appropri languag method way communic intra generate develop curricula teach method provid last collabor platform theorize critic analysi relationship age digit world draw expertis research work wide rang nation transnat set foster inter institut share resourc expertis age media student faculti communiti worker select industri partner final creat strong institut partnership connect academ institut academ organ likewis concern research topic method point research undertak inter relat area agenc age collabor creativ digit art later life involv communiti develop project scholar creativ outcom enhanc agenc critic mediat everyday life cultur age examin varieg mediat cultur experi adult later life technolog age network societi investig age context network societi primarili conduct methodolog associ social scienc bridg internet research age studi process result creation vibrant platform collabor research institut exchang disciplin sector fulfil type activ year face face network meet pilot project case studi instig research question concept knowledg product creat intern exchang produc intern research public partner event summer school opportun research exchang faculti student graduat post graduat level collabor exhibit public research event virtual seminar webcast network public concordia institut partner collabor product robust websit dissemin research result resourc bibliographi public report link network upcom event post,0,"health, environment"
62,Digital culture and quantified aging ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Barbara L Marshall,Trent University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110274,"Conversations about aging populations often trade in apocalyptic demographic predictions of a 'silver tsunami' with dire consequences for the distribution of social resources. Yet optimism is also pinned on new technologies as pivotal in solving the problems of an aging population. As tech-savvy boomers embrace the message of 'active aging', industry leaders predict that they will turn to 'personal technologies' to support their participation in risk-averse lifestyles. Others predict that technology will permit more people to age at home rather than in care facilities. While a range of technologies is implicated, our research is directed at those that track, measure, compare, aggregate and thus quantify, in various ways, age and age-related function. Our focus is on 'quantified aging': the ways that self-tracking technologies and digital apps are used to create new modes and styles of measuring, calculating, storing and sharing information about the aging self. Our objectives are to: 1) trace the origins and development of the digital, or algorithmic, measurement of 'age' and age-related characteristics; 2) analyze the conceptualization, design, marketing and consumer take-up of tracking and measuring technologies aimed at aging individuals; and 3) explore how these technologies become part of the speculative futures of aging, anti-aging, and revisions of care in aging societies. To meet these objectives, we will undertake historical and documentary research and field research at technology and consumer electronic trade shows; conduct textual and visual analysis of marketing and informational materials; conduct interviews with engineers, tech designers, marketers and policy makers, undertake discourse analysis of professional and popular literatures; and conduct interviews, focus groups and social network analysis with users of these technologies. Three types of technologies will be examined: a) 'Wearables' and mobile technologies, including those designed for self-monitoring (such as fitness trackers) and those designed for tracking and monitoring aging individuals by caregivers or institutions. b) Digital apps that collect and connect data from wearable devices, and/or deploy algorithms for 'calculating' age and its correlates; and c) Age-related apps relying on the rhetoric of games and scores, such as those used in digital 'brain training' games that track imagined cognitive plasticity and enhancement, while promising protection against decline. Across these contexts we will explore how concepts of age and 'success' in aging are produced in technical ways and investigate how these connect to professional, actuarial and cultural practices that divide populations into young/old, active/inactive, fit/frail, responsible/irresponsible and risky/risk-averse. Our intent is not to deny that new technologies benefit the lives of older people, but to suggest that such technologies cannot be assessed outside the social contexts in which they are developed, promoted, used and capitalized. Because Canada, like other Western nations, is experiencing the convergence of an aging population and an increased interest in and reliance on digital technologies, the expected outcomes of the research will have both scholarly and social impacts. We will contribute to the knowledge creation around an underexplored but central series of topics and will increase research capacity in the areas of aging and technology. We will train students who will be equipped to take up professional careers and/or policy-making roles in an aging society. Our research will also encourage ethical reflection and debate on the implications of quantification and new measures of age in relation to questions of social status, social inequality and surveillance.",0.0686927413671599,convers age popul trade apocalypt demograph predict silver tsunami dire consequ distribut social resourc optim pin technolog pivot solv problem age popul tech savvi boomer embrac messag activ age industri leader predict turn person technolog support particip risk avers lifestyl predict technolog permit peopl home care facil rang technolog implic research direct track measur compar aggreg quantifi way relat function focus quantifi age way self track technolog digit app creat mode style measur calcul store share inform age self object trace origin develop digit algorithm measur relat characterist analyz design market consum track measur technolog aim age individu explor technolog specul futur age anti age revis care age societi meet object undertak histor documentari research field research technolog consum electron trade show conduct textual visual analysi market inform materi conduct interview engin tech design market polici maker undertak discours analysi profession popular literatur conduct interview focus group social network analysi user technolog type technolog examin wearabl mobil technolog includ design self monitor fit tracker design track monitor age individu caregiv institut digit app collect connect data wearabl devic deploy algorithm calcul correl relat app reli rhetor game score digit brain train game track imagin cognit plastic enhanc promis protect declin context explor concept success age produc technic way investig connect profession actuari cultur practic divid popul young activ inact frail respons irrespons riski risk avers intent deni technolog benefit live older peopl suggest technolog assess outsid social context develop promot capit canada like western nation experi converg age popul increas relianc digit technolog expect outcom research scholar social impact contribut knowledg creation underexplor central seri topic increas research capac area age technolog train student equip profession career polici make role age societi research encourag ethic reflect debat implic quantif measur relat question social status social inequ surveil,0,"health, environment"

As the number of medications increases, so too does the risk of side effects. Some medications pose greater risks than others. For example, some medications can cause a person to fall, have trouble with their memory, or lead to hospital emergency room visits for low blood sugar. When medications are prescribed for which safer alternatives exist, it is called ""inappropriate prescribing"". National specialist consensus panels regularly publish lists of inappropriate drugs that pose an elevated risk of adverse effects, yet unfortunately inappropriate prescribing persists. As many as 1 in 4 Canadian seniors on public drug programs consume one or more inappropriate medications. Our project proposes a novel intervention whereby pharmacists provide educational materials to both seniors and their primary care providers on the risks of taking inappropriate prescriptions. Recommendations to change inappropriate prescriptions to safer alternatives are provided. Forty-six community pharmacies in Quebec will help us recruit 400 of clients to this project. We hope to show that empowered patients can play a role in helping health professionals reduce inappropriate prescriptions and increase medication safety in the elderly.",0.15,canadian probabl suffer differ medic condit have medic increas number medic increas risk effect medic pose greater risk exampl medic caus person fall troubl memori lead hospit emerg room visit blood sugar medic prescrib safer altern exist call inappropri prescrib nation specialist consensus panel regular publish list inappropri drug pose elev risk advers effect unfortun inappropri prescrib persist canadian senior public drug program consum inappropri medic project propos novel intervent pharmacist provid educ materi senior primari care provid risk take inappropri prescript recommend chang inappropri prescript safer altern provid communiti pharmaci quebec help recruit client project hope empow patient play role help health profession reduc inappropri prescript increas medic safeti elder,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

Patients have altered consciousness level, sleep disturbance, memory problems, and are unable to focus attention or concentrate. Delirium is common, serious, and potentially preventable. Delirium impacts nearly all patients from the critically ill to elderly living at home. Delirium can result in death, complications, prolonged hospital stay, and loss of independence resulting in long-term care placement. For these reasons, studies of treatments to prevent or reverse delirium have risen considerably. To determine the effects of treatments, researchers measure outcomes, for example quality of life, symptoms, or complications. At present, there is no consistency in outcomes studied by researchers for methods to prevent or treat delirium. This creates problems as we cannot compare or combine study results, making treatment decisions difficult. One strategy to overcome this problem is to agree upon a set of main outcomes for a health condition, called a core outcome set (COS). We aim to develop COS for studies of methods to prevent or treat delirium for critically ill and hospitalized patients, those requiring palliative care, and older adults at risk of delirium. We will review the evidence base to determine outcomes already used. We will interview patients and families about outcomes important to them. We will conduct a Delphi study (consensus building exercise) to seek opinion from patients/family with experience of delirium, clinicians, and researchers and to reach agreement. We will test in this Delphi study if the way we provide information influences the results. We will hold a meeting to establish the final COS. Engagement in research projects may be hard. We will interview our patient/family participants to find out what was hard, what worked well, and recommendations to inform similar studies in the future.

65,Welcoming the 'Sacred Spirit' (child): Connecting Indigenous and Western 'ways of knowing' to inform future policy partnerships to optimize maternal child health service delivery initiatives in remote Canadian regions ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),Nathan C Nickel,University of Manitoba,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/213145,"""When the child is about to arrive, the elderly women performed the delivery and the baby's ""otisis"" was given to the mother. Elders were part of a welcoming ceremony done later for baby and their family, and the feast prepared by all of the family, friends and community. What's missing [in communities] today is welcoming and honouring the 'gift of life' (teaching from Elder Katherine Whitecloud, MB). Ongoing and historical colonial health practices have systematically diminished the health and well-being of Indigenous communities. One critically important primary healthcare service that shows the impact of colonial relations is maternal/child healthcare. There is the ""absence of teachings regarding the 'Sacred Spirit' (child) along with the responsibilities and preparation for 'life-giving' across the childbearing continuum (preconception, pregnancy, birth and post-delivery). Strategies to embrace and include Indigenous knowledge, values, teachings, and stories are essential for a healthy life in Indigenous communities; the absence of these strategies disrupts the relations among youth, young parents, families, and communities. In this study, we explore maternal healthcare delivery systems and services across 4 remote Canadian jurisdictions. Our exploration includes Indigenous and Western world views and aims to improve the health of communities by bringing back the 'Sacred Spirit' [child]. The teaching tells us that achieving this equates to maintaining wellness. We have and will continue to actively engage Indigenous and non-Indigenous members in 4 remote Canadian jurisdictions each involved in delivering or receiving maternal care. Data sources include interviews, focus groups [story-telling], and document analysis. The outcome will be identification of maternity care delivery models that are integrated, cost-efficient, culturally appropriate, and effectively supporting persons to maintain health and wellness within their own community.",0.1217592592592592,child arriv elder women perform deliveri babi otisi give mother elder welcom ceremoni later babi famili feast prepar famili friend communiti miss communiti today welcom honour gift life teach elder katherin whitecloud ongo histor coloni health practic systemat diminish health indigen communiti critic import primari healthcar servic show impact coloni relat matern child healthcar absenc teach sacr spirit child prepar life give childbear continuum preconcept pregnanc birth post deliveri strategi embrac includ indigen knowledg valu teach stori essenti healthi life indigen communiti absenc strategi disrupt relat youth young parent famili communiti studi explor matern healthcar deliveri system servic remot canadian jurisdict explor includ indigen western world view aim improv health communiti bring sacr spirit child teach tell achiev equat maintain well continu activ engag indigen indigen member remot canadian jurisdict involv deliv receiv matern care data sourc includ interview focus group stori tell document analysi outcom identif matern care deliveri model integr cost effici cultur appropri effect support person maintain health well communiti,0,"health, environment"

Hul'q'umi'num' culture is centered on oral performance---ceremonies, music, and storytelling. Over the last fifty years, many Hul'q'umi'num' Elders, because of their grave concern for the future of their language, have had their stories recorded, and we now have a collection of over one thousand texts in all genres, including folktales, legends, autobiographies, public speeches, how-to demonstrations, traditional cultural teachings, and conversations. Thanks to previous SSHRC funding, our experienced team of native speakers and linguists has transcribed and translated these, resulting in a text corpus of more than 12,000 pages. An objective of our project is to create a written literature for Hul'q'umi'num' by preparing these texts for publication---glossing, formatting, and indexing them---and at the same time updating our Hul'q'umi'num' dictionary to include any new words we discover. Also, we honor the legacy of the Hul'q'umi'num' storytellers by using digital media to share the audio or video files of story performances, together with their translations and transcriptions, thereby supporting the efforts of the younger generation to become fluent in their language. The Hul'q'umi'num' Elders are very talented raconteurs, and another objective of our project is to develop an appreciation of stories as verbal art by studying aspects of their performance. We will research narrative and rhetorical structure, detailing the way storytellers use: framing devices such as introductions and conclusions; oral paragraphs to create coherence; parallelism, focus, and contrast to provide emphasis; dialogue to help bring the story to life; and song interludes to help anchor the main lesson of the story in listeners' minds. We will also examine the prosodics of the oral performance of stories, measuring intonation, rhythm, relative emphasis, and rhetorical lengthening, to learn how storytellers use their voices to help convey information and to hold listeners' attention. For example, we will undertake the linguistic analysis of a set of devices we call ""enhancers"", e.g. repetitions, echoes, lists, parentheticals, and vocatives. Because enhancers are not part of core syntactic structure (the subject, object, and verb), they have been largely ignored in the linguistic literature. Our research will thus make a contribution to the theoretical and typological analysis of such devices. It is the goal of our project to make a thorough study of the performances of storytellers in order to gain a better appreciation of stories as oral literature. Capacity building is an important aspect of our project, which partners First Nations Elders and university scholars with First Nations graduate students. Our project adopts decolonized methodologies based on Coast Salish traditional learning models, encouraging students to draw on their cultural knowledge, language fluency, and oratory talents to become accomplished storytellers, while concurrently developing their skills in linguistic analysis and written communication.",0.1508201708201708,stori prosod pragmat perform project focus languag peopl live salish british columbia cultur center oral perform ceremoni music storytel fifti year elder grave concern futur languag stori record collect thousand text genr includ folktal legend autobiographi public speech demonstr tradit cultur teach convers thank previous sshrc fund experi team nativ speaker linguist transcrib translat result text corpus page object project creat write literatur prepar text public gloss format index time updat dictionari includ word discov honor legaci storytel digit media share audio video file stori perform translat transcript support effort younger generat fluent languag elder talent raconteur object project develop appreci stori verbal studi aspect perform research narrat rhetor structur detail storytel frame devic introduct conclus oral paragraph creat coher parallel focus contrast provid emphasi dialogu help bring stori life song interlud help anchor main lesson stori listen mind examin prosod oral perform stori measur inton rhythm relat emphasi rhetor lengthen learn storytel voic help convey inform hold listen attent exampl undertak linguist analysi devic enhanc repetit echo list parenthet vocat enhanc core syntact structur subject object verb larg ignor linguist literatur research contribut theoret typolog analysi devic goal project thorough studi perform storytel order gain better appreci stori oral literatur capac build import aspect project partner nation elder univers scholar nation graduat student project adopt decolon methodolog base coast salish tradit learn model encourag student draw cultur knowledg languag fluenci oratori talent accomplish storytel concurr develop skill linguist analysi write communic,-1,"health, environment"

As community practitioners are keenly aware, the death of each elder who speaks the language represents irretrievable loss of specific indigenous ways of speaking, of seeing the world, of communicating about the land, and the physical and social environment. Amidst the grief and sense of loss experienced in First Nations speech communities, groups of individuals First Nations language communities are in fact ""doing something about it"", having established a range of local initiatives to document the local language, create new speakers, and transfer the language to the next generations. This seven year project is a partnership between Simon Fraser University's recently established First Nations Language Centre and community based First Nations organizations comprising at least 11 languages whose work is dedicated to the maintenance and revitalization of indigenous languages. Grassroots organization based community language practitioners, including elders, community linguists, language learners and educators will engage with a team of indigenous and non-indigenous academic researchers with multi-disciplinary backgrounds to co-produce knowledge and innovative practices that address the challenges of language loss and revitalization. Our goals are to produce local research, and to mobilize knowledge, sharing ""best practices"" insights. Specifically, we will: 1) develop, share and practice innovative ways of language documentation that combine linguistic and indigenous methodologies, and fill gaps in existing data. Themes in documentation include the recording and analysis of natural conversation in archived and recorded speech, stories, conversations, traditional ecological knowledge as well as various specific registers of speech. 2) linguistic, ethnographic and psychological research of ""language-in-use"" in our respective speech communities among current speakers, semi-speakers and second language learners, to gain a better understanding of the changing domains of use of languages, and emerging changes in structure and repertoires which will inform new ways of assessing fluency and proficiency. We will also co-produce and mobilize knowledge about Aboriginal language learning in urban centres connected to ancestral communities, and among youth. 3) develop interactive digital media (apps) for language learning. Innovative digital technology, including 3D holography, will provide interactive exploration of culturally grounded subject matter, providing a powerful collaboration tool between teachers and learners that is accessible 24/7 through a one-on-one interactive instruction environment crucial to language acquisition and comprehension. The impact of these apps on language proficiency, retention and use will be studied and measured. 4) develop protocols and procedures for the digitization, safe storage and access of language materials w to create safe repositories for their data.

68,Hul'q'umi'num' phonetic structures: exploring paths towards fluent pronunciation ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Donna B Gerdts,Simon Fraser University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/115354,"The Indigenous language revitalization movement is growing in Canada in response, in part, to the awareness that well-being depends upon a solid foundation of linguistic and cultural identity. In British Columbia, home to 60% of Canada's Indigenous languages, very few first-language speaking Elders remain, and so this movement is being carried by adult second-language learners. These language champions have taken on the task of transmitting their language to the next generation, as teachers and parents, and as researchers doing crucial language documentation work. Adult Indigenous language learners are very conscious of the fact that they are responsible for their language's survival, and that if they don't 'get it right', the language will be forever changed. For learners of Salish languages though, authentic pronunciation is difficult, Salish languages being among the most complex in the world in terms of their sound systems. The Coast Salish language Hul'q'umi'num' has 37 consonants, 24 of which do not occur in English. Thus, while Hul'q'umi'num' learners have very high standards with respect to pronunciation, they face difficulties due to the complexity of the phonetic structures. Our immediate objective is to support the development of oral fluency among adult Hul'q'umi'num' language learners, using linguistic analysis as a tool for both research and education. Our longer-term goal is to create the foundation for expanding our partnership with other Coast Salish communities currently focused on developing oral fluency in adult second language learners. Our team consists of university-based and community-based partners who collectively have over a century of experience in teaching, learning, and researching Hul'q'umi'num', as well as decades of experience in research spanning four academic fields: linguistics (phonetics and phonology), second language acquisition, applied linguistics (language learning and teaching), and Indigenous education. Our research focuses on the more challenging aspects of Hul'q'umi'num' pronunciation, including consonants, consonant clusters, and rhythm. During our three-year project, we will conduct a detailed phonetic analysis of pronunciation by speakers at various levels of fluency, identify what the pronunciation challenges are for learners, and develop, implement, and assess pedagogical methods and materials for addressing these challenges. Capacity building is an important aspect of our project, and language teachers will improve their own oral fluency while gaining important knowledge and methods for helping learners to acquire Hul'q'umi'num' phonetic structures. Research on second language pronunciation has overwhelmingly focused on English, and therefore Coast Salish languages, with their incredibly rich sound systems, have much to offer in terms of increasing our understanding of the articulatory, perceptual, and cognitive mechanisms that underlie the human capacity for language learning in adulthood.

69,Private and social insurance of long-term care for the elderly ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Tatyana A Koreshkova,Concordia University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113359,"In the U.S. and Canada, about half of retirees will experience an event that requires nursing home care. Nursing home expenses are very high, averaging $85,000 per year. In spite of growing long-term care needs of the aging population, few individuals hold private long-term care insurance; most rely on private savings and public long-term care programs. As a result, governments are concerned with the unsustainable burden of the growing cost of public long-term care. The objective of this research agenda is to understand the distinct roles played by private and social insurance of long-term care risk and to derive policy implications that would achieve both sustainability of the public long-term care finance and an optimal mixture of the private and social insurance. I propose to achieve the objectives in four stages. The first two stages use the best available data -- U.S. Health and Retirement Survey -- and model the U.S. long-term care insurance market in order to understand how it works. Once we have a fully developed framework, at the last two stages, the analysis is extended to study long-term care insurance in the context of the Canadian economy. Stage 1: Why the private long-term care insurance market is so small? We propose a model of private and social insurance for long-term care risk, that reproduces salient features of the long-term care insurance market -- the small market size, high cost, high rejections rates and incomplete risk coverage -- as well as the distribution of recipiency for social insurance. We models both supply and demand sides of the insurance market. Optimal insurance contracts are offered by a profit maximizing monopolist. Adverse selection arises because the monopolist does not observe the true risk exposure of the applicants. On the demand side, private long-term care insurance is crowded out by means-tested social insurance. We find that while social insurance discourages purchase of long-term care insurance for the poor, the supply-side frictions explain the non-purchase by more affluent. Moreover, holders of insurance are less likely to enter a nursing home. Stage 2: Welfare analysis of private and social long-term care insurance for retirees. The project will evaluate distributional effects of long-term care subsidies, means-tests for social insurance, tax credits, partnerships of public and private long-term care insurance, with an objective of finding an optimal mix of social and private insurance. The model builds on the results from the first stage and extends it to a realistic life-cycle with a more comprehensive structure of old-age risks, many of which increase with age. Stage 3: Canadian social and private insurance of long-term care builds on the framework developed in the first two stages. In Canada, long-term care is part of the provincial health care system and it is publicly funded on a cost-shared basis with residents. The project will address the following questions: Why is the market for private long-term care insurance much smaller in Canada? Should Canadian government encourage purchases of private long-term care insurance and what are the best incentives it can provide? Stage 4: Choice of long-term care. This project endogenizes the cost of care by modeling the choice of care: formal and informal home care, assisted living and nursing home. The substitution/complementarity between the types of care and their relative cost have important implications for policies seeking to shift the burden of long-term care to private finance. This research bridges three fundamental literatures: theoretical optimal-contracting literature, empirical literature on adverse selection, and quantitative macro literature on the welfare of the elderly and public policy.",0.1037641025641025,canada half retir experi event requir nurs home care nurs home expens high averag year spite grow long term care need age popul individu hold privat long term care insur reli privat save public long term care program result govern concern unsustain burden grow cost public long term care object research agenda understand distinct role play privat social insur long term care risk deriv polici implic achiev sustain public long term care financ optim mixtur privat social insur propos achiev object stag stag best avail data health retir survey model long term care insur market order understand work fulli develop framework stag analysi extend studi long term care insur context canadian economi stage privat long term care insur market small propos model privat social insur long term care risk reproduc salient featur long term care insur market small market size high cost high reject rat incomplet risk coverag distribut recipi social insur model suppli demand side insur market optim insur contract offer profit maxim monopolist advers select aris monopolist observ true risk exposur applic demand privat long term care insur crowd mean test social insur social insur discourag purchas long term care insur poor suppli friction explain purchas affluent holder insur like enter nurs home stage welfar analysi privat social long term care insur retir project evalu distribut effect long term care subsidi mean test social insur credit partnership public privat long term care insur object find optim social privat insur model build result stage extend realist life cycl comprehens structur risk increas stage canadian social privat insur long term care build framework develop stag canada long term care provinci health care public fund cost share basi resid project address follow question market privat long term care insur smaller canada canadian govern encourag purchas privat long term care insur best incent provid stage choic long term care project endogen cost care model choic care formal inform home care assist live nurs home substitut complementar type care relat cost import implic polici seek shift burden long term care privat financ research bridg fundament literatur theoret optim contract literatur empir literatur advers select quantit macro literatur welfar elder public polici,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"

Older patients are more likely to experience a negative outcome while in hospital, such as a fall or drug reaction. These events can lead to a loss of independence for elderly patients and prevent them from returning home. However, these life-altering consequences can be prevented by changing how our hospitals treat seniors. Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto-now a national leader in elder-friendly care-attempted to address this challenge when it launched its Acute Care for Elders (ACE) Strategy in 2010. Since then, the ACE Strategy, which touches all aspects of the older patient's experience from when they arrive in the emergency department to after they return home, has saved Ontario's health care system over $6 million per year in unnecessary hospitalizations, while improving patient safety and satisfaction. On March 31st, 2016, the Canadian Foundation for Health Improvement (CHFI) and the Canadian Frailty Network (CFN) launched the ACE Collaborative, a partnership with 17 hospitals across Canada who will receive financial support and coaching to implement components of the ACE Strategy over the next twelve months. These hospitals range in size from small rural hospitals to large teaching centres. My project will begin at the close of the ACE Collaborative in March, 2017. Over the course of the next 12 months, I will study the hospitals to identify which factors lead to the continued use of ACE Strategy practices and maintenance of any gains in efficiency, patient satisfaction, or safety once the support of the ACE Collaborative is removed. My research will help fill an important knowledge gap in our understanding of what happens after healthcare innovations are implemented.

72,An integrated knowledge translation approach to examining a model of volunteer navigation (NCARE) to support older adults living with advanced chronic illness in the home. ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Jayna M Holroyd-Leduc,University of Calgary,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/152448,"For older adults living with advanced chronic illness, aging in place is key to quality of life but without adequate support can result in heavy symptom burden and social isolation. Older adults may not be aware of health and social resources available in their communities, so an innovative model was developed to provide navigation services. In this person-centered approach, trained volunteer navigators advocate, facilitate community connections, coordinate access to services/resources, and promote active engagement of older adults with their community (NCARE: Navigation, Connecting, Accessing, Resourcing, and Engaging). Pilot work indicates this model provides important support to older adults while developing meaningful roles for volunteers. The purpose of this project is to enhance the quality of life of older adults living with advanced chronic illness at home by implementing, evaluating, and planning a sustainable volunteer navigation model using an integrated knowledge translation approach. Eight hospice societies from rural, remote, and urban contexts in BC, AB, and NS are project partners. Hospice volunteers and older adults living with advanced chronic illness will be recruited in each community. Volunteers will receive training and then provide navigation services to assigned older adults, visiting in the home every 2-3 weeks for 18 months. They will be supported by a nurse navigator coach, a hospice society volunteer coordinator, and a local healthcare provider. Evaluation data will be gathered from older adults, families, volunteers, and other stakeholders. At project conclusion, a tool-kit will be created to enable hospice societies across Canada to implement volunteer navigation. Anticipated contributions to Canadian healthcare are significant: older adults will have better quality of life, volunteers will have enhanced roles that build hospice capacity, and supportive care will be implemented early for those living with advanced chronic illness.",0.1990476190476191,older adult live advanc chronic ill age place qualiti life adequ support result heavi symptom burden social isol older adult awar health social resourc avail communiti innov model develop provid navig servic person center approach train volunt navig advoc facilit communiti connect coordin access servic resourc promot activ engag older adult communiti ncare navig connect access resourc engag pilot work indic model provid import support older adult develop meaning role volunt purpos project enhanc qualiti life older adult live advanc chronic ill home implement evalu plan sustain volunt navig model integr knowledg translat approach hospic societi rural remot urban context project partner hospic volunt older adult live advanc chronic ill recruit communiti volunt receiv train provid navig servic assign older adult visit home week month support nurs navig coach hospic societi volunt coordin local healthcar provid evalu data gather older adult famili volunt stakehold project conclus tool creat enabl hospic societi canada implement volunt navig anticip contribut canadian healthcar signific older adult better qualiti life volunt enhanc role build hospic capac support care implement earli live advanc chronic ill,-1,"health, environment"

People in nursing homes are very dependent upon their caregivers and this leads to increased staff workload and unfortunately, results in a lower quality of care. Working life for those caregivers is often poor. For a long time there has been, and continues to be, concern about the quality of care in nursing homes. National and international reports have repeatedly highlighted this problem. As Canadians live longer and growing numbers survive into very late life, the need for high quality nursing home care for the elderly will increase dramatically.

74,Changing places: unpaid work in public spaces ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Jacqueline A Choiniere,York University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/110132,"Long-term care debates often assume that moving to residential care relieves residents and families from the intense care work that occurs in many households. Yet, the realities of unpaid care work in residential homes are poorly understood, prompting the need for further investigation of this critical policy area. Meaningful involvement in certain tasks can promote residents' independence, and families often want to provide some forms of support. However, our team's current research suggests that changing conditions in residential care may prevent residents from doing self-care, while pressuring families to do more care work than they are prepared for. Our proposed three-year project is a comparative analysis of changes and continuities in self-care and family care work with the move from home to residential care. We seek to identify conditions that support unpaid work that is rewarding and meaningful for families and residents. Neo-liberal developments in public policy, increasing privatization, and population aging call out for research on how unpaid labour in the private household extends into paid care work and public services. To further develop theories on the relationship between private/unpaid and public/paid labour in aging societies, we will expand on feminist perspectives and conduct rapid ethnographies in nine residential care facilities in Ontario, Sweden, and Norway. Comparative research across three jurisdictions will allow us to capture complexities, differences, and similarities in paid and unpaid labour related to state policies and to ways of organizing work. Residential care provides an excellent research site for identifying forms of unpaid work that are rewarding and appropriate---or burdensome and constraining---for women and men in different social, economic and physical locations. They do so for several reasons. First, the residential care facilities we will study all receive significant public financing and are highly regulated, offering ways to explore how state policies impact unpaid labour. Second, feminist research has long focused on the invisibility of unpaid care work in the private household. This research allows us to look at unpaid labour in locations that are public, yet are intended to be home-like. Finally, women do the majority of unpaid work and make up the majority of residents and paid workers in residential care, making an analysis of gender relations in unpaid work particularly germane. Our new project addresses research questions arising from our SSHRC-funded MCRI Re-imagining Long-term Residential Care: An International Study of Promising Practices (2010-2018). Using analytic mapping and rapid site-switching ethnographies, it focused on four themes: approaches to care, accountability, funding/ownership and work organization. In the process, we identified a number of areas that cry out for further study, including self-care and family care work. We need to know more about what options women and men have when engaging in unpaid work, under what conditions, and what resources are available to support their unpaid labour. This project builds on the innovative methodologies, collaborative relationships, and strong tradition of student mentorship we have been developing. With various disciplinary backgrounds and expertise on gender, diversity, care work, and aging, our co-applicants, collaborators, and community partners are well poised to make scholarly and practical interventions on unpaid care work in diverse contexts. We will work closely with our partners to mobilize knowledge through presentations and publications for academic and policy audiences, and through workshops and plain language documents for a wide range of community organizations.",0.1695711350796097,long term care debat assum move residenti care reliev resid famili intens care work occur household realiti unpaid care work residenti home poor understand prompt need investig critic polici area meaning involv certain task promot resid independ famili want provid form support team current research suggest chang condit residenti care prevent resid self care pressur famili care work prepar propos year project compar analysi chang continu self care famili care work home residenti care seek identifi condit support unpaid work reward meaning famili resid liber develop public polici increas privat popul age research unpaid labour privat household extend pay care work public servic develop theori relationship privat unpaid public pay labour age societi expand feminist perspect conduct rapid ethnographi residenti care facil ontario sweden norway compar research jurisdict allow captur complex differ similar pay unpaid labour relat state polici way organ work residenti care provid excel research site identifi form unpaid work reward appropri burdensom constrain women differ social econom physic locat reason residenti care facil studi receiv signific public financ high regul offer way explor state polici impact unpaid labour second feminist research long focus invis unpaid care work privat household research allow look unpaid labour locat public intend home like final women major unpaid work major resid pay worker residenti care make analysi gender relat unpaid work particular german project address research question aris sshrc fund mcri imagin long term residenti care intern studi promis practic analyt map rapid site switch ethnographi focus theme approach care account fund ownership work organ process identifi number area studi includ self care famili care work need know option women engag unpaid work condit resourc avail support unpaid labour project build innov methodolog collabor relationship strong tradit student mentorship develop disciplinari background expertis gender divers care work age applic collabor communiti partner pois scholar practic intervent unpaid care work divers context work close partner mobil knowledg present public academ polici audienc workshop plain languag document wide rang communiti organ,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
75,Imagining age-friendly communities within communities: international promising practices ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Jacqueline A Choiniere,York University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/115527,"Our partnership will transform fears about an aging population into conversations and practices that address both the complexities and possibilities inherent in a world that welcomes the meaning that old age brings to life. Imagining Age-Friendly ""Communities within Communities"": International Promising Practices, builds on the World Health Organization's (WHO) ""Age-Friendly Communities"" global initiative. Our conceptualization of promising practices in aging assumes that they ""add life to years"", rejecting so-called apocalyptic notions of population aging. To make unique contributions that address these complexities, this partnership includes scholars and partners from many disciplinary and sectoral perspectives. Addressing critical knowledge gaps identified by WHO, we will investigate how culture and gender matter in creating age-friendly cities. Our goal is to enhance the effectiveness of age-friendly practices in light of demographic shifts associated with both population aging and diversity. We ask: how can age-friendliness support conditions in which all senior citizens not only maintain healthy active lives, but can participate and create meaning in later life? The age-friendly strategy operates mostly at the city-community level with a one-size-fits-all approach. Our attention to ""communities within communities"" across 12 cities in Canada and around the world guides us to account for differences. Attention to gender draws us to investigate how inequalities and differences between and among women, men and non-binary people play out in seniors' lives and policy assumptions. Our approach to culture assumes diversities due to global migrations; imperatives for Truth and Reconciliation with indigenous peoples; intra-cultural gender roles; and rich community cultures among people with disabilities and LGBTIQ2S groups, which affect what it means to grow old with dignity and respect. We will investigate what makes age-friendly communities promising places with ""promising practices"" for women, men and non-binary people; those living in poverty; LGBTIQ2S, ethno-racial, indigenous, disability and Dementia communities; families who require specific supports and services; and those who support seniors, especially migrants and domestic carers, who are aging on the job. We recognize that seniors are a mobile population, moving across neighbourhoods and the globe for many reasons, from fleeing persecution to downsizing. Our Canadian and international academic experts, are among the few who have done theoretical, empirical, comparative and policy work on age-friendly communities using interdisciplinary, gender and diversity-informed perspectives. Our research will build on and extend WHO-identified domains in focusing on the following themes: policies and systems; environments, designs and technologies; approaches to aging; and care relationships (conditions and quality). Our international comparative research, which incorporates ethnographic, survey, policy network, social work, cultural studies and arts-based methods, will unfold over a seven-year period in communities in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Norway and Taiwan. Our innovative methods involve international collaborative research in partnership with local community groups. We bring together 18 academic and sectoral partners comprised of university-based Centres for Aging Research, organizations for seniors and their care providers, and representatives of various levels of government.

Treating people with CKD and kidney failure is very expensive, costing the health system nearly $50 billion per year in Canada. Kidney disease is very common in people with diabetes, high blood pressure and heart disease, and kidney disease increases the risk of dying in such patients by two to eight-fold. The Canadians Seeking Solutions and Innovations to Overcome Chronic Kidney Disease (Can-SOLVE CKD) Network is a national partnership centered around patients and involving all key stakeholder groups: patients, caregivers, health practitioners, policy-makers, and researchers. Our Network will create new national core infrastructure that can support research, knowledge translation and training for years to come. Over the last three years, we have worked with patients with CKD and policy-makers to determine their top research priorities. We then developed a research program around these projects, which focus on three themes: Theme 1: Identify Kidney Disease Earlier and Support Those at Highest Risk of Negative Outcomes; Theme 2: Define Best Treatments to Improve Outcomes and Quality of Life; and Theme 3: Define the Optimal Ways to Deliver Patient-centered Care in the 21st Century. Over the next 5 years, our research program will find and test new discoveries. Evidence will be translated into practice and care to benefit patients.

A known complication of epilepsy is cognitive impairment and dementia. Here we propose to study how common these conditions co-exist in older adults and what the needs of these persons living with both of these conditions are. We suspect that dementia will be more likely to occur in individuals who have epilepsy than individuals in the general population, and vice versa. METHODS: Data will be collected from a large database (~12 million records) in the United Kingdom. We will examine how common is epilepsy in persons with dementia, and vice versa. Statistical software will be used to analyze risk factors, comorbidities, and frailty in this population. The frailty indexes of those with epilepsy and dementia will be compared to populations of individuals with only epilepsy, and only dementia to see how this particular population affected by both condition (epilepsy and dementia) is unique. We will then do focus groups to understand the needs and concerns of people affected by these two conditions simultaneously. This is a group that has been overlooked in the past, and whereby resources to support them are limited. EXPECTED OUTCOME: We hope to make public health policy recommendations that could eventually become implemented and allow for better care and prevention strategies for people living with dementia and epilepsy.

78,We Know Who We Are: Intergenerational Understandings of Métis Identity and Well-Being Using Digital Storytelling ( 2018/19-2019/20 ),Chelsea Gabel,McMaster University,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/183759,"The proposed research seeks to gain insight into the ways in which Métis elders, adults and youth living in Manitoba and Saskatchewan understand their identity and to explore the nature of contact and communication between these three generations. Our key goal is to learn how such intergenerational relationships shape Métis identity, how they relate to the overall well-being of Métis peoples and shed some light on where Métis peoples may be headed in the future. Currently, there is a severe underrepresentation of Métis in academic research and a lack of adequate, accurate and accessible data and information on Métis health and well-being that is community-based and participatory. This project uses a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach and the digital storytelling methodology, an arts-based research method in which participants create short stories to document their understandings of the research questions, to address three dimensions of this issue. First, we will gain insight into the ways in which Métis elders, adults and youth describe, understand, and express their identity, identifying the common elements that connect Métis generations through time and space. Second, we will seek to better understand the relational aspects that help or hinder Métis elder-adult-youth interaction and how these relationships relate to their overall well-being. Third, the digital storytelling process will serve as an intervention by bringing three generations together in a safe space to document and share cultural knowledge and traditions and plan future occasions in which they might interact in meaningful ways. Little is known about how different Métis generations perceive one another and their respective roles and identities in a contemporary context. This project will address this gap in knowledge by engaging with elders, adults and youth to discuss their experiences and address barriers and enablers that influence their ability to communicate, understand and engage with each other. This work is timely given the current questions surrounding the nature of Métis identity in Canada including the increase in numbers of individuals claiming Métis status, how Métis see themselves and how their understandings are prescribed by others including the state. Our project is novel because we recognize that the well-being of these three groups is closely linked, and that the process of bringing them together to address the challenges they face using digital storytelling is mutually beneficial. This project will support the development of ongoing, reciprocal relationships among researchers, Métis communities, government and non-governmental organizations. Findings hold promise for Métis organizations and other Indigenous communities who are interested in developing culturally sensitive and/or culturally competent programming that bring different generations together. Results will also substantially advance our scholarly understanding of Métis identity and well-being and evaluate the role of digital technology and whether it could be beneficial for community health and well-being, supporting and strengthening community capacity. This project has the potential to mediate some of the issues that are faced by elders, adults and youth in Métis communities today. For youth, this includes issues with violence, substance abuse problems, and youth suicide. Possible benefits for elders and adults include the reinforcement of meaningful, traditional roles as knowledge keepers and increased social contact. Addressing these issues will improve quality of life for Métis peoples across many generations.",0.1209280303030302,propos research seek gain insight way métis elder adult youth live manitoba saskatchewan understand ident explor natur contact communic generat goal learn relationship shape métis ident relat overal métis peopl shed light métis peopl head futur current sever métis academ research lack adequ accur access data inform métis health communiti base participatori project use communiti base participatori research cbpr approach digit storytel methodolog art base research method particip creat short stori document understand research question address dimens issu gain insight way métis elder adult youth understand express ident identifi common element connect métis generat time space second seek better understand relat aspect help hinder métis elder adult youth interact relationship relat overal digit storytel process serv intervent bring generat safe space document share cultur knowledg tradit plan futur occas interact meaning way littl know differ métis generat perceiv respect role ident contemporari context project address knowledg engag elder adult youth discuss experi address barrier enabl influenc abil communic understand engag work time give current question surround natur métis ident canada includ increas number individu claim métis status métis understand prescrib includ state project novel recogn group close link process bring address challeng face digit storytel mutual benefici project support develop ongo reciproc relationship research métis communiti govern government organ find hold promis métis organ indigen communiti interest develop cultur sensit cultur compet program bring differ generat result substanti advanc scholar understand métis ident evalu role digit technolog benefici communiti health support strengthen communiti capac project potenti mediat issu face elder adult youth métis communiti today youth includ issu violenc substanc abus problem youth suicid possibl benefit elder adult includ reinforc meaning tradit role knowledg keeper increas social contact address issu improv qualiti life métis peopl generat,0,"health, environment"

Unfortunately, the best way to treat shoulder fractures is currently one of the most debated areas of orthopaedics. Existing clinical studies comparing various methods of surgical and non-surgical management have reported conflicting results. These studies have had limited numbers of patients, involved single centres, and used inconsistent treatment methods and inclusion/exclusion criteria. Therefore, there is insufficient evidence supporting any one treatment type, and a poor understanding of what factors influence the outcomes that are important to patients, making decisions regarding treatment difficult. We propose to establish DECIPHER, the first nation-wide, multi-centre observational study with 744 fully characterized patients with the ultimate goal of determining what specific factors influence patient important outcomes. Additionally, we will answer important research questions concerning treatment and rehabilitation strategies. Patients 50 and older with shoulder fractures will be recruited from 17 centres across Canada. Patients will be followed for two years, during which time patient function and quality of life measures will be collected at regular intervals. An economic analysis will be conducted to determine the impact of treatment type on patient and healthcare system costs. The information collected through DECIPHER will not only help improve patient care, but provide critical data for future studies to determine the best strategies for managing these difficult and prevalent injuries.",0.0922398589065255,shoulder fractur increas common older adult result consider limit function qualiti life unfortun best treat shoulder fractur current debat area orthopaed exist clinic studi compar method surgic surgic manag report conflict result studi limit number patient involv singl centr inconsist treatment method inclus exclus criteria insuffici evid support treatment type poor understand factor influenc outcom import patient make decis treatment difficult propos establish deciph nation wide multi centr observ studi fulli character patient ultim goal determin specif factor influenc patient import outcom addit answer import research question concern treatment rehabilit strategi patient older shoulder fractur recruit centr canada patient follow year time patient function qualiti life measur collect regular interv econom analysi conduct determin impact treatment type patient healthcar cost inform collect deciph help improv patient care provid critic data futur studi determin best strategi manag difficult preval injuri,1,"health, house, money, volunteer, abuse"
80,Healing practices and paradigms: a study of Indigenous and biomedical healthcare at Yellowknife's Stanton Territorial Hospital ( 2020/21 ),Sophie I Roher,University of Toronto,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/231603,"To improve the quality of care for Indigenous patients, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has called for greater collaboration between Indigenous and biomedical healing practices. In the Northwest Territories (NWT), where over 50% of residents are First Nations, Inuit and Metis, the need is particularly great. My PhD research builds on a project I conducted with the Stanton Territorial Hospital Elders Council in Yellowknife, NWT. During our work together, the Elders emphasized that Indigenous and biomedical health services may be understood and experienced differently by patients and health providers and that these different understandings can greatly impact the quality of hospital care. Using an Indigenous storytelling methodology that is grounded in two-eyed seeing and postcolonial theory, my research asks: How do Indigenous and non-Indigenous patients, health providers and traditional healers experience and understand Indigenous and biomedical healing practices at Stanton Territorial Hospital? This project will (1) describe participants' stories and experiences of hospital care and the extent to which their stories and experiences are shaped by their understandings of Indigenous and biomedical healing practices; (2) illuminate the extent to which colonial practices and representations shape participant experiences of hospital care; and (3) provide clear recommendations to improve patient care experiences at Stanton Hospital. This project has been created in partnership with Elders, patients, community leaders and health authority officials and will be guided throughout by a Community Advisory Committee to ensure that the project is patient-oriented and abides by ethical practices and community protocols. Ultimately, this research seeks to address the TRC's calls for action and improve health services for Indigenous patients in the NWT by providing clear direction on how to enhance Indigenous and biomedical health service provision at Stanton Hospital.",0.2807692307692308,improv qualiti care indigen patient truth reconcili commiss call greater collabor indigen biomed heal practic northwest territori resid nation inuit meti need particular great research build project conduct stanton territori hospit elder council yellowknif work elder emphas indigen biomed health servic understand experi differ patient health provid differ understand great impact qualiti hospit care indigen storytel methodolog ground eye see postcoloni theori research ask indigen indigen patient health provid tradit healer experi understand indigen biomed heal practic stanton territori hospit project particip stori experi hospit care extent stori experi shape understand indigen biomed heal practic illumin extent coloni practic represent shape particip experi hospit care provid clear recommend improv patient care experi stanton hospit project creat partnership elder patient communiti leader health author offici guid communiti advisori committe ensur project patient orient abid ethic practic communiti protocol ultim research seek address call action improv health servic indigen patient provid clear direct enhanc indigen biomed health servic provis stanton hospit,-1,"health, environment"

Although studies show that the quality of health services offered to and taken up by Indigenous patients is negatively impacted when Western approaches to health and healing are prioritized over Indigenous approaches, Indigenous healing paradigms and practices are excluded from institutionalized healthcare in most parts of Canada. In an attempt to improve the quality of care for Indigenous people, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) has called for greater collaboration between Indigenous and Western healers. Currently, however, there are very few hospitals in Canada that work to bridge Indigenous and Western approaches to healing. In the Northwest Territories (NWT), the need is particularly great. Despite NWT's high proportion of Indigenous residents (51%), there are few initiatives in hospitals that incorporate both Indigenous and Western healing practices. Furthermore, there is a gap in knowledge about how patients and providers currently experience Indigenous and Western healing paradigms in practice. In order to address the TRC's calls for action and improve the quality of health services for Indigenous people and communities in the NWT, it is critical to fill this knowledge gap. My PhD research will use community-based qualitative research methods and the 'two-eyed seeing' approach to (1) examine how healthcare providers and patients in the NWT understand and experience the interaction between Indigenous and Western healing paradigms in hospital settings, and (2) illuminate the assumptions and values underlying these paradigms, which inform the quality of health service provision.

However, there is very limited information on the current health status of IS, as well as factors such as personal health behaviours and available healthcare services contributing to the IS' health, in remote northern communities in Canada. The Government of the Northwest Territories (NT) has asked the Indigenous and Global Health Research Group (IGHRG) to work together with local Indigenous communities to examine health status of and related issues facing seniors in two communities with large Indigenous populations: Inuvik and Yellowknife. One hundred-fifty IS will complete interviewer-administered questionnaires regarding health conditions, smoking, medication use, and access to healthcare services. Moreover, seniors, and stakeholders in senior care and health care will be invited to key informant interviews and formal and familial caregivers to sharing circles to enhance knowledge regarding barriers to and opportunities for improving health and health care services for IS in the NT.

Obesity is an important risk factor for developing NAFLD and T2D which contribute to the development of liver cancer and heart disease. Therefore, designing new ways to treat or prevent T2D and NAFLD are important. Brown adipose tissue (BAT) is an organ which has long been known to exist in rodents and infants but remarkably only in the last 5 years has been discovered in adult humans. BAT has the unique capability, compared to any other organ in the body, to burn large amounts of sugar and fat and effectively dissipate this energy as heat due to the presence of unique protein called uncoupling protein 1. Thus BAT is frequently characterized as the body's furnace. The activation of BAT in rodents has been shown to reverse obesity, T2D and NAFLD. In addition recent studies have shown that by exposing humans to cold you can increase BAT activity and lower blood sugar levels suggesting that increasing BAT activity may represent a viable therapy for treating T2D. Unfortunately, in individuals with obesity or T2D the ability to switch on BAT is compromised. Determining why BAT activity is reduced and identifying new ways to switch it on has generated world-wide scientific and clinical excitement around developing a new therapy for obesity, NAFLD and T2D and is the focus of the current proposal. In this proposal we will conduct studies in cells, mice and humans to examine how agricultural and food processing practices may regulate BAT metabolic activity directly or indirectly by altering the billions of bacteria that reside within our gastrointestinal tract. These studies will help us develop new strategies to enhance BAT activity that may be effective for treating and preventing obesity, NAFLD and T2D.",0.1083896103896103,million canadian chronic interrel diseas obes alcohol fatti liver diseas nafld type diabet incid popul rapid increas obes import risk factor develop nafld contribut develop liver cancer heart diseas design way treat prevent nafld import brown adipos tissu organ long know exist rodent infant remark year discov adult human uniqu capabl compar organ bodi burn larg amount sugar effect dissip energi heat presenc uniqu protein call uncoupl protein frequent character bodi furnac activ rodent show revers obes nafld addit recent studi show expos human cold increas activ lower blood sugar level suggest increas activ repres viabl therapi treat unfortun individu obes abil switch compromis determin activ reduc identifi way switch generat world wide scientif clinic excit develop therapi obes nafld focus current propos propos conduct studi cell mice human examin agricultur food process practic regul metabol activ direct indirect alter billion bacteria resid tract studi help develop strategi enhanc activ effect treat prevent obes nafld,-1,"health, environment"

Elders and community members are concerned that chemicals produced from oil sands activity are contaminating the water supply and harming the health of wildlife and humans. One of the major areas of concern is related to reproductive health. Oil and gas contaminants have the potential to impact fertility of Indigenous men, women and children as well as the unborn generations. In addition, reduced reproductive success in wildlife means population declines which impact the cultural, economic and social well-being of Indigenous communities through the erosion of the trust they have in their natural environment, and as a consequence, impacts on their ability to harvest and consume traditional foods.

88,Introducing the emotional and affective geographies of law: strengthening community through the practice and feeling(s) of Inuit law ( 2013/14-2019/20 ),Sean Robertson,University of Alberta,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/117391,"Colonialism has led to a crisis in the rule of law in Indigenous communities, further exacerbating social problems related to colonialism, such as poverty and substance abuse. In Nunavut, Inuit law is held up as the key to restoring social order, but also to improving socio-economic conditions and encouraging Inuit self-determination. Like all Indigenous law, it is not state edicts that determine and implement normative Inuit behavior, but everyday embodied conduct. The financial challenges of hunting and other on-the-land practices frustrate this legal process. Further, with elders nearing the end of their lives, the impending loss of generational understanding of law adds urgency to this situation. This research will address these crises through a partnership with elders and knowledge keepers in Kugaaruk, a hamlet located at the meeting of the Arctic Ocean and the Kugaaruk River. This partnership has been founded on the local priorities of material support for Inuit law and documenting the cultural importance of sealing and fishing, and associated social and legal norms. Two elder-led camps for youth and the residential schools generation(s) here will provide a case study for a qualitative methodology-based inquiry into Indigenous legal traditions and practices at the core of Kugaarukmiut ('Kugaaruk people') life, as well as into relations with seal and fish. I argue that despite their adherence to pragmatism, socio-legal scholars have not paid enough attention to the spatial context of norm making, which gives rise to this study's innovative theoretical approach. By ignoring how feelings in (emotion) and the feel of space (affect) inform local legal frameworks, they deny the relational paradigm underpinning Inuit ways of being, knowing, and ""doing"" the world and the law. By introducing emotional and affectual geographies---called ""more-than-representational"" since they partly occur in the precognitive register---to the study of everyday law, I recognize them not simply as personal feeling(s) but as cultural regimes which intersect with the law to reinforce the unequal distribution of power in society. Given that the Inuit are known for valorizing self-control and for their embodied connections to place, Kugaaruk provides a unique and rich research setting. I begin by generally inquiring into the culture surrounding sealing and fishing. This will illuminate not only the social norms and laws pertaining to nonhumans and humans, but also the implication of emotions and affect in normative development and implementation. Little socio-legal work has been done in the Arctic, let alone with a conceptual framework that captures the spatiality intrinsic to Inuit law. I extend the legal pragmatic approach by illuminating the importance of the embodied aspects of all law, so as to contribute to legal anthropology, comparative law, legal geography, and Indigenous studies. This work will be useful to scholars of emotions, and the legal profession, which must incorporate Inuit norms in Nunavut. For the Inuit, this research will better describe their legal intellectual resources and inform Inuit public debate on contemporary social challenges. The land camp/participant observation methodology will give the community another practical opportunity to redevelop and enact their laws. By exploring harvesting-related knowledge, norms, and stories via participatory mapping, my inquiry further builds upon Inuit capacity by providing them with tools to better communicate with the resource industry and policy makers. Finally, equipping Inuit with the fullest analysis of and support for their normative systems promotes Canada's interest in strong northern governance.",0.1076992753623188,coloni crisi rule indigen communiti exacerb social problem relat coloni poverti substanc abus nunavut inuit hold restor social order improv socio econom condit encourag inuit self determin like indigen state edict determin implement normat inuit behavior everyday embodi conduct financi challeng hunt land practic frustrat legal process elder near live impend loss generat understand add urgenc situat research address crise partnership elder knowledg keeper kugaaruk hamlet locat meet arctic ocean kugaaruk river partnership found local prioriti materi support inuit document cultur import seal fish associ social legal norm elder camp youth residenti school generat provid case studi qualit methodolog base inquiri indigen legal tradit practic core kugaarukmiut kugaaruk peopl life relat seal fish argu despit adher pragmat socio legal scholar pay attent spatial context norm make give rise studi innov theoret approach ignor feel emot feel space affect inform local legal framework deni relat paradigm underpin inuit way know world introduc emot affectu geographi call part occur precognit regist studi everyday recogn simpli person feel cultur regim intersect reinforc unequ distribut power societi give inuit know valor self control embodi connect place kugaaruk provid uniqu rich research set begin general inquir cultur surround seal fish illumin social norm law pertain nonhuman human implic emot affect normat develop implement littl socio legal work arctic conceptu framework captur spatial intrins inuit extend legal pragmat approach illumin import embodi aspect contribut legal anthropolog compar legal geographi indigen studi work use scholar emot legal profess incorpor inuit norm nunavut inuit research better legal intellectu resourc inform inuit public debat contemporari social challeng land camp particip observ methodolog communiti practic opportun redevelop enact law explor harvest relat knowledg norm stori participatori map inquiri build inuit capac provid tool better communic resourc industri polici maker final equip inuit fullest analysi support normat system promot canada strong northern govern,0,"health, environment"

During the CIHR Component 2 funded young adult suicide research project with this team in Northern BC, First Nation Elders, together with community members noted unmet mental wellness needs among their older adults. Those aged 45+ are exposed to specific risk factors including isolation, addictions, poverty, elder abuse, and a cultural gap between Elders and younger generations. Older adult (45+) segment of the population is valued because it represents the next generation of Elders with a role in sharing their knowledge and skills with younger generations. It is proposed that work with youth and young adults be expanded and adapted to meet the unmet needs older adults. The goals of the study are to adapt and expand the previous suicide intervention to meet the needs of older adults, compile previously developed interventions for youth, young adults, and older adults into a suite of interventions that address mental wellness and suicide prevention across the life course, share the suite of interventions with other First Nation.

90,Elevating the Uses of Storytelling Approaches within Indigenous Health Research: A Patient-engaged Scoping Review Study Involving Indigenous People and Settlers ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),Annette S Schultz,University of Manitoba,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215736,"There are calls to integrate Indigenous knowledges and wellness practices into healthcare systems. However, Western research approaches are often used in an attempt to understand Indigenous perspectives, resulting in findings and policies which fail to address the priorities and health needs of Indigenous peoples. Storytelling, long used by Indigenous communities to share knowledge, is increasingly being used as a research approach by Indigenous people and settlers to privilege Indigenous perspectives. However, this work has not been critically reviewed. Our study purpose is to better understand and elevate the use of storytelling as an approach in Indigenous health research. In this collaborative research project, a team of Indigenous patients, Elders, healthcare providers, and administrators will join Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers to bring multiple perspectives and experiences to the research. Our multidisciplinary team will find and critically review research using storytelling to determine how this approach has been used in Indigenous health research. Team members will co-create the research objectives, and continue to work together throughout the research project to ensure that Indigenous patient voices and perspectives are prioritized. We will also develop a framework to guide the respectful use of storytelling approaches in health research that involves Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. Although we understand some of the reasons behind why the health of Indigenous peoples is worse than the health of other Canadians, there are still many unknowns. Research that prioritizes Indigenous voices and knowledges using storytelling is crucial for filling the gaps in our understanding. This research project will develop a better understanding of respectful approaches to storytelling in health research among Indigenous peoples, and promote storytelling as a meaningful way of gaining new knowledge to address the health needs of Indigenous peoples.",0.0977272727272727,call integr indigen knowledg well practic healthcar system western research approach attempt understand indigen perspect result find polici fail address prioriti health need indigen peopl storytel long indigen communiti share knowledg increas research approach indigen peopl settler privileg indigen perspect work critic review studi purpos better understand elev storytel approach indigen health research collabor research project team indigen patient elder healthcar provid administr join indigen indigen research bring multipl perspect experi research team critic review research storytel determin approach indigen health research team member creat research object continu work research project ensur indigen patient voic perspect priorit develop framework guid respect storytel approach health research involv indigen indigen peopl understand reason health indigen peopl wors health canadian unknown research priorit indigen voic knowledg storytel crucial fill gap understand research project develop better understand respect approach storytel health research indigen peopl promot storytel meaning gain knowledg address health need indigen peopl,-1,"health, environment"
91,Indigenous People and Diabetes - Indigenous Knowledge and Wellness Practices disrupting Biomedical Colonization: Research Governed by Decolonizing and Two-Eyed Seeing Methods ( 2019/20-2020/21 ),Annette S Schultz,University of Manitoba,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/215720,"""Everyone is struggling with this same problem, diabetes, it's a huge problem and we are trying to get people to start the conversation to see how to fix it ... it's not a simple pill or injection ... It involves the cost of food, the housing, the social structures, the traditional teachings, the animals on the land."" Paul Linton, Eeyou Istchee James Bay Cree Community member Before the 1950s, type 2 diabetes (TTD) was unheard of in most Indigenous populations. However, since the number of Indigenous peoples with TTD has increased and age of diagnosis is younger than in the general population. Current treatments for TTD are based on a biomedical worldview, or western science, such as increased physical activity and dietary changes. Health from this worldview focuses on the physical body. Most Indigenous people, however, look at the whole body (emotional, spiritual, physical and mental) in relational to the land. Since Europeans, the colonizers, came to North America or Turtle Island, Indigenous people have lost their relationship to the land, gathering and hunting less traditional foods while rates of TTD continue to rise. To address this, a diverse group of settler and Indigenous peoples developed a 4-year multiple-methods study that will use Indigenous methodologies, such as ceremonies, stories and oral history, which will be guided by 4 Elders. The study aims to value and respect Indigenous, biomedical, and historical perspectives of health and TTD using decolonizing and two-eyed seeing approaches. Research objectives to address are to: 1) Create spaces to elevate Indigenous knowledge relevant to TTD, relation to the land and traditional foods; and 2) Collaboratively build bridges between Indigenous knowledge and places where Indigenous people access TTD healthcare services. The hope is that new pathways to address TTD will be realized through Indigenous peoples' awakening to original teachings of the importance of the sacred relationship to the land.",0.0867153679653679,struggl problem diabet huge problem tri peopl start convers simpl pill inject involv cost food hous social structur tradit teach anim land paul linton eeyou istche jam cree communiti member type diabet unheard indigen popul number indigen peopl increas diagnosi younger general popul current treatment base biomed worldview western scienc increas physic activ dietari chang health worldview focus physic bodi indigen peopl look bodi emot spiritu physic mental relat land european colon come north america turtl island indigen peopl lose relationship land gather hunt tradit food rat continu rise address divers group settler indigen peopl develop year multipl method studi indigen methodolog ceremoni stori oral histori guid elder studi aim valu respect indigen biomed histor perspect health decolon eye see approach research object address creat space elev indigen knowledg relev relat land tradit food collabor build bridg indigen knowledg place indigen peopl access healthcar servic hope pathway address realiz indigen peopl awaken origin teach import sacr relationship land,-1,"health, environment"

The context of colonialism in Canada has serious implications for the well-being of Indigenous people. To address the source of illness, including social determinants of health such as colonization, this study will use a decolonizing, community-based approach in both the implementation of a decolonizing arts-based intervention for Indigenous families and the study of that intervention. An Indigenous approach will be considered throughout the research process to support the centring of Indigenous voices in research. Following a community-based approach, an intervention will be developed in collaboration with community Elders and stakeholders and will focus on the implementation of a culturally-rooted intervention for full-family wellness. The intervention will be facilitated by Indigenous leaders in the community deemed suitable by community Elders. The intervention will incorporate traditional cultural engagement such as artistic expression and the process of creating, as this has shown to be a positive determinant of health that improves wellness for many Indigenous people. In this study, the purpose is to gain an understanding of Indigenous families, Elders, and community artists' experiences and impressions of the intervention as it relates to physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual well-being. For this purpose, an Indigenous storywork method will be used to analyze research conversations and talking circles facilitated with the Elders, artists, and families who take part in the intervention.

93,q'?nq'ot?a??nc ??wi'nagwis (Knowing our land): Documenting Gwa’sala and ’Nakwaxda’xw Cultural Keystone Places in Kwak'wala ( 2017/18-2019/20 ),Daisy Rosenblum,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/112623,"There is growing recognition that the landscapes which surround us, even those which we might consider 'wild', are the product of millennia of interaction with the people who inhabit those landscapes (Anderson 2005; Turner 2014; Baldy 2013 inter alia), and that careful tending by Indigenous inhabitants has benefited the ecosystems receiving such care (cf. Anderson 2005; Trant et al. 2016). In turn, current research with Aboriginal communities points to the crucial importance of cultural and linguistic continuity for individual and collective well-being. (McIvor 2014; Baldwin et al. 2015). Such continuity is inextricably territorial: linked to persistence of relationships between people and place, and mediated through biocultural and sociolinguistic practices. This project seeks to illuminate such interconnections of people, place, and culture. Working collaboratively with Gwa'sala and 'Nakwaxda'xw Elders and community researchers we will document their knowledge of two Cultural Keystone Places (Cuerrier et al. 2015), Ba'as and Takush, the ancestral villages from which they and their families were removed in 1964. Crucially, knowledge will be recorded in the Kwak'wala language in which the Elders knew and continue to know the landscape, allowing for the fullest expression of place-based knowledge expressed in a grammar which foregrounds spatial information (Rosenblum 2015; Wilson p.d.). Expected outcomes of this research include forty hours of new documentation, twenty hours of which will be selected for transcription and translation. Together with legacy documentation from earlier scholars (Boas 1947; Hunt and Boas 1921 inter alia), earlier research by academic and community-based scholars, and building on my dissertation research on the grammar of landscape in Kwak'wala, these materials will elaborate a full picture of the seasonal round of life in the traditional territories of the Gwa'sala and 'Nakwaxda'xw Nations. Through user-centred design planning in community meetings and workshops, we will determine an appropriate format and interface (i.e. website, touchscreen, app) through which residents of Tsulquate can 'visit' their territories with their Elders, via video, audio, and panoramic photographs, thus contributing to a community-based process of recovery from traumatic disruption.Genres of data to be recorded include origin stories and oral histories; place-names; species names of flora and fauna; procedural texts for harvesting and use; recipes for food and medicine; traditional use and occupancy patterns; Map-Biographies (Tobias 2012); conversations prompted by video stimuli created at CKPs (cf. Rosenblum 2015 on methodology); and Elders' memories of life in these places. The Indigenous language of a land holds untranslatable and irreplaceably specific knowledge: the morphology of place names and plant names describes resources, seasonal cycles, species migration, origin stories, and history; narratives of journeys reflect patterns of use and occupancy; memories of traditional practices hold the seeds of cultural revitalization. It is essential to do this documentation now, while the Elders who hold the knowledge of both language and land together are still with us. This project builds on and connects with the work underway by the almagamated Gwa'sala-'Nakwaxda'xw Band at the Tsulqate Reserve, following a settlement agreement with the Government of Canada in 2008 (http://www.gwanak.info/for-members/gn-trust), to restore their communities' connections to their traditional territories. While providing training for undergraduate and graduate students as well as community members, the work will contribute to community goals of renewing and revitalizing Traditional Ecological Knowledge. The materials will be stored in a user-centered archive also making previous documentation accessible to community members, in the service of community-based healing, teaching and learning. Prioritizing documentation of place-based knowledge in the language of the territory will contribute methodological approaches and analytical advancements to a cross-cultural trajectory of research on the mutual engagements of people, place and culture.

94,"Creative later-life in a digital age: mobilizing music and creative technologies for inclusive later-life musical learning and participation, creative expression, digital literacy, and quality of life ( 2017/18-2019/20 )",Audrey-Kristel Barbeau,Université du Québec à Montréal,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/115324,"This cross-sector, interdisciplinary Partnership is focused on developing understandings of how Music and Creative Technologies (MaCT) can be applied in ways that will support inclusive opportunities for creative expression, lifelong learning and participation, and enhanced quality of later life. Our Partnership is founded upon a collaborative, critically reflective framework designed to 1) mobilize knowledge from cross-sector, interdisciplinary, and intergenerational perspectives concerning the ways in which music technology can support a creative later life; 2) expand the opportunities for creative expression through music, amongst older people; 3) deepen the learning and engagement of older people in our digital age in ways they will find meaningful and relevant; and 4) be taken up and used by caregivers and community music leaders in their professional practice. To achieve these objectives our Partnership, guided by a Steering Group and an International Research Advisory Group, brings together multifaceted expertise representing music education, music care, music technology and gerontechnology, intergenerational learning, lifelong learning, and community education. Two key societal challenges underpin our Partnership objectives. First, we are witnessing a longevity revolution whereby the global population aged 65+ is increasing markedly. The aging population represents a triumph of public health policy yet poses substantial challenges with regards to sustained quality of life, with particular issues relating to depression, loneliness, and chronic disease. In response, a growing body of evidence has demonstrated significant social, emotional, and cognitive benefits of music-making amongst senior citizens. Second, the 21st century has been distinguished by accelerated use of digital technology. Increasingly, attention has been directed towards the possibilities offered by technology for enhancing the quality of later life. However, a persistent generational digital divide has been noted. Engagement with technology within the practice of listening, playing, creating, and performing music provides a stark example of the digital divide. Although music technology with younger people is now well-established, there is limited research concerned with the use of music technology to foster positive quality of later-life. However, digital music technologies offer strong potential to: 1) serve as a vehicle whereby older people may overcome barriers to musical engagement and maximize the potential for the wider benefits of music-making to enhance their quality of life, and 2) function as a context where the generational digital divide may be mediated. Thus, recognizing the complex needs of an increasingly aging population and the potential of new creative digital technologies to meet these needs, our partnership will engage in communicative dialogue and participatory action research activities to interrogate the following critical questions: a) how can MaCT be mobilized and adapted in order to maximize equitable access in later life to creative musical expression, engagement in learning, digital literacy and quality of life amongst older citizens? b) what related knowledge and understanding can be developed in the context of intergenerational learning?; c) in what ways might emerging music technologies foster digital literacy and mitigate the generational digital divide in Canada and elsewhere?; and d) what are the risks, opportunities and related ethical questions raised by the adoption of digital music technologies in contexts focused on the care and support of older people?",0.0950605384199134,cross sector partnership focus develop understand music creativ technolog mact appli way support inclus opportun creativ express lifelong learn particip enhanc qualiti later life partnership found collabor critic reflect framework design mobil knowledg cross sector perspect concern way music technolog support creativ later life expand opportun creativ express music older peopl deepen learn engag older peopl digit way meaning relev take caregiv communiti music leader profession practic achiev object partnership guid steer group intern research advisori group bring multifacet expertis repres music educ music care music technolog gerontechnolog learn lifelong learn communiti educ societ challeng underpin partnership object wit longev revolut global popul age increas mark age popul repres triumph public health polici pose substanti challeng regard sustain qualiti life particular issu relat depress loneli chronic diseas respons grow bodi evid demonstr signific social emot cognit benefit music make senior citizen second centuri distinguish acceler digit technolog increas attent direct possibl offer technolog enhanc qualiti later life persist generat digit divid note engag technolog practic listen play creat perform music provid stark exampl digit divid music technolog younger peopl establish limit research concern music technolog foster posit qualiti later life digit music technolog offer strong potenti serv vehicl older peopl overcom barrier music engag maxim potenti wider benefit music make enhanc qualiti life function context generat digit divid mediat recogn complex need increas age popul potenti creativ digit technolog meet need partnership engag communic dialogu participatori action research activ interrog follow critic question mact mobil adapt order maxim equit access later life creativ music express engag learn digit literaci qualiti life older citizen relat knowledg understand develop context learn way emerg music technolog foster digit literaci mitig generat digit divid canada risk opportun relat ethic question rais adopt digit music technolog context focus care support older peopl,0,"health, environment"

In our previous discussions with leaders from Lytton First Nation, there was a strong desire to include more men, boys, and Two-Spirited people and persons who identify as LGBTQ in healthy lifestyle initiatives. To achieve this goal, we will hold eight knowledge sharing circles with community members (including Elders and Sex and Gender leaders) regarding the aspirations for health and wellness with a particular focus on the roles sex and gender play in shaping wholistic health and wellness. This community-based and Indigenous-led project will build upon partnerships that we have created in our past work with Lytton First Nation. We will build upon our community-based health and wellness toolkit, and our healthy lifestyle intervention model ""With Every Step, We Grow Stronger"" that we co-created with Lytton First Nation. Through our proposed work, we will create a new health and wellness toolkit that will provide insight into the roles sex and gender play in shaping healthy lifestyle behaviours at the level of the community. This first-of-its-kind toolkit will be shared through our existing Indigenous knowledge translation portals and accessed worldwide. We will also build new community relationships by working with Stein Valley Nlaka'pamux School to host a community-based conference in Lytton First Nation.

96,"Restor(y)ing place-based Indigenous physical cultural identities: examining the relationships between movement, land, language, and masculinities ( 2017/18-2019/20 )",Moss E Norman,University of British Columbia,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/113521,"This project engages two Swampy Cree (Muskéko Ininiw) nations-Fisher River Cree Nation (Ochekwi-Sipi) and Norway House Cree Nation (Kinosao-Sipi)-in examining the relationship between land-based physical cultural practices (i.e., physical activity broadly defined), the Cree language, and Indigenous masculinities. The over-arching purpose of this project is to build-on existing community expertise in fostering Cree masculine roles and responsibilities defined in relation to family, community, language, and land-based physical cultures (see Phillips & McKegney, 2017). The literature on Indigenous masculinities, gender, and sexuality studies, while using a range of theoretical perspectives, is nonetheless consistent in the understanding that settler colonialism (see Wolfe, 2006) targeted diverse Indigenous gender formations for destruction and that this has had---and continues to have---devastating consequences for Indigenous peoples and their communities (e.g., Barker, 2017; Driskill et al., 2011; Maracle, 1988; Smith, 2005). In response to the historical and ongoing processes of colonization, Indigenous scholars and practitioners have worked towards the revitalization and resurgence of Indigenous gender formations (see Antone, 2015; Tengan, 2008) that are disruptive of dominant Euro-Western heteropatriarchal constructions (Hokowhitu, 2012, 2015). However, the work designed to revitalize the roles and responsibilities of Indigenous girls and women has arguably been more successful than it has been for boys and men (Innes & Anderson, 2015). Acknowledging this disparity is not intended to set up ""competing marginalities"" (Fellows & Razack, 1997-8) between men and women, but rather to recognize that the revitalization of Indigenous gender cosmologies is always about re-balancing relations between men and women, trans and Two-Spirit people, the family, the community, and the complex web of other-than-human relations (McLeod, 2014; Perea, 2017). Methodologically, the project is divided into four phases, with each phase organized into reiterative and ever-expanding circles of: knowledge gathering, collaborative analysis, community knowledge dissemination, and further knowledge gathering. The project is designed to work with community experts (e.g., Elders, land- and language experts) in fostering intergenerational mentoring networks, building relevant community capacities (e.g., Elder-led storytelling workshops; Cree language and digital literacy skills) as a means of restor(y)ing (Bang et al., 2014) Indigenous places (Tuck & McKenzie, 2015) and place-specific masculinities. The project is embedded in an Indigenous research paradigm (see Hart, 2010; Kovach, 2009; Wilson, 2008) and uses culturally relevant methods (i.e., sharing circles, intergenerational interviews, community feasts) as well as novel methods (e.g., digital mapping, and digital storytelling) in engaging approximately 170 participants (i.e., 85 from each nation) in an intra- and inter-community wide conversation about Indigenous physical cultural masculinities. This research will contribute to the scholarly literature on Indigenous land, language, and physical cultural identities, particularly Indigenous masculinities. The research will also contribute to local, provincial, and national level policy, curricula, and programming related to Indigenous physical cultural-, land-centred-, and language-literacies. To this end, a report will be presented to the Manitoba Ministry of Education and Manitoba Physical Education Supervisory Association, with the intention of shaping curricula at the provincial level, and the research will have direct implications for Kinesiology curricula at the Universities of Manitoba and British Columbia.",0.0827020202020202,project engag swampi cree muskéko ininiw nation fisher river cree nation ochekwi sipi norway hous cree nation kinosao sipi examin relationship land base physic cultur practic physic activ broad defin cree languag indigen masculin arch purpos project build exist communiti expertis foster cree masculin role defin relat famili communiti languag land base physic cultur phillip mckegney literatur indigen masculin gender sexual studi rang theoret perspect nonetheless consist understand settler coloni wolf target divers indigen gender format destruct continu devast consequ indigen peopl communiti barker driskil maracl smith respons histor ongo process colon indigen scholar practition work revit resurg indigen gender format anton tengan disrupt domin euro western construct hokowhitu work design revit role indigen girl women arguabl success boy inn anderson acknowledg dispar intend compet margin fellow razack women recogn revit indigen gender cosmolog balanc relat women tran spirit peopl famili communiti complex human relat mcleod perea project divid phase phase organ reiter expand circl knowledg gather collabor analysi communiti knowledg dissemin knowledg gather project design work communiti expert elder land languag expert foster mentor network build relev communiti capac elder storytel workshop cree languag digit literaci skill mean restor bang indigen place tuck mckenzi place specif masculin project emb indigen research paradigm hart kovach wilson use cultur relev method share circl interview communiti feast novel method digit map digit storytel engag approxim particip nation intra inter communiti wide convers indigen physic cultur masculin research contribut scholar literatur indigen land languag physic cultur ident particular indigen masculin research contribut local provinci nation level polici curricula program relat indigen physic cultur land centr languag literaci report present manitoba ministri educ manitoba physic educ supervisori associ intent shape curricula provinci level research direct implic kinesiolog curricula univers manitoba british columbia,0,"health, environment"

98,ATSA-ESI: Assistive Technology Supporting Aging with Emotional and Social Intelligence ( 2016/17-2019/20 ),Jesse Hoey,University of Waterloo,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/9941,"For the past twelve years I have been building sophisticated assistive technology (AT) designed to assist elderly persons with dementia (e.g. Alzheimer's). An increasingly elderly population is placing a significant strain on the healthcare system, and an unsustainable burden on informal caregivers (e.g. spouses/children caring for their spouse/parent at home). I develop technologies that can provide autonomy and independence in aging, thereby releasing informal carers from part of this burden, and decreasing healthcare costs. Much progress has been made, but there is a long way to go before these devices are effective and usable. This proposal is to build a unified operational model of engineering, psychological and sociological perspectives on assistive technology (AT) for elder care. Increasingly, the notions of social, emotional and affective intelligence are playing a key role in the pursuit of effective human-machine interaction, including AT. For AT development, these notions are known to have a major impact on the actions of persons with dementia. For example, as Alzheimer's disease interferes with memory, it can often result in a person enacting a past identity, and treating such a person otherwise creates dissonance leading to conflict, stress, and depression, and certainly to AT non-adoption. To handle this, I develop artificially intelligent systems that integrate social and emotional factors into human-interactive systems including AT. I develop these systems using a foundation of probabilistic and decision theoretic sequential dynamical models. The next five years of my research will focus on the theoretical and practical development of group process models, guided by social-psychological theory, with specific application to AT for aging. I will work along three key avenues: hierarchical modelling of sentiment in groups of individuals and applications to specific assistive technologies, machine learning of user and context models from sensor data of individual and group interactions, and development of models of group processes in general beyond AT, based on social-psychological principles, with application to social networks. My currently supported research looks specifically at socio-emotional issues at the level of individual interactions (e.g. a single individual engaged in a single activity), and with a user-evaluative focus. In this proposal, I tackle the problem of modelling groups of individuals, going beyond the person in need of care to include their informal caregiver, their doctor, professional carer, offspring, siblings, neighbours and community. Based on social-psychological theory, I will develop and test models of social networks of elderly persons to provide more effective and tailored care. This work will dovetail with the other, more individual-oriented work funded by my other grants.",0.112954260651629,past year build sophist assist technolog design assist elder person dementia alzheim increas elder popul place signific strain healthcar unsustain burden inform caregiv spous children care spous parent home develop technolog provid autonomi independ age releas inform carer burden decreas healthcar cost progress long devic effect usabl propos build unifi oper model engin psycholog sociolog perspect assist technolog elder care increas notion social emot affect intellig play role pursuit effect human machin interact includ develop notion know major impact action person dementia exampl alzheim diseas interfer memori result person enact past ident treat person creat disson lead conflict stress depress certain adopt handl develop artifici intellig system integr social emot factor human interact system includ develop system foundat probabilist decis theoret sequenti dynam model year research focus theoret practic develop group process model guid social psycholog theori specif applic age work avenu hierarch model sentiment group individu applic specif assist technolog machin learn user context model sensor data individu group interact develop model group process general base social psycholog principl applic social network current support research look specif socio emot issu level individu interact singl individu engag singl activ user evalu focus propos tackl problem model group individu go person need care includ inform caregiv doctor profession carer offspr sibl neighbour communiti base social psycholog theori develop test model social network elder person provid effect tailor care work dovetail individu orient work fund grant,-1,"health, environment"
99,The Women and HIV Research Program: Impactful Research with Diverse Women Living with and at Risk of HIV in Canada ( 2017/18-2020/21 ),Mona R Loutfy,Women's College Hospital,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147849,"Dr. Mona Loutfy is recognized as a national and international leader in the area of women, reproductive health, and HIV. She founded the Women and HIV Research Program in 2006, which uses community-based research to carry out research that is deemed most essential to women living with and at risk of HIV. This Foundation Grant will move the Research Program to exciting new areas with three goals: 1) finalizing a new model of care (the Women-centred HIV Care Model) aimed at optimizing the health and wellbeing of women with HIV in Canada, particularly those at increased risk of HIV including Indigenous women and trans women; 2) disseminating created knowledge on Reproductive Health and HIV (i.e. the 2018 Canadian HIV Pregnancy Planning Guidelines); and 3) mentoring and training the next generation of researchers, clinicians and community partners that will focus on health equity for women with and at risk of HIV. A novel aspect of this Grant is the building of a Canadian Trans Women and HIV Research Initiative - a timely endeavour given the current climate of trans health and the Prime Minister's submission for the inclusion of gender identify, Bill C-16, in the Canadian Human Rights Act in 2016. Another exciting component of this Grant is the partnering with Indigenous researchers and leaders to further research for the wellbeing of Indigenous women living with and at risk of HIV. This will be done using the principles of Truth and Reconciliation of Canada, Indigenous ethical guidelines including First Nations, Inuit and Metis guidelines and ""Two-eyed Seeing"" research methods. Dr. Loutfy has worked as an ally to Indigenous researchers and leaders for a decade and is committed to continuing this work by contributing to strength-based and culturally-grounded research with Indigenous women. This will include working with Elders and Knowledge Keepers and Indigenous women themselves. She successfully did similar work with racialized Black women for the prior 12 years.",0.1429292929292929,mona loutfi recogn nation intern leader area women reproduct health found women research program use communiti base research carri research deem essenti women live risk foundat grant research program excit area goal final model care women centr care model aim optim health wellb women canada particular increas risk includ indigen women tran women dissemin creat knowledg reproduct health canadian pregnanc plan guidelin mentor train generat research clinician communiti partner focus health equiti women risk novel aspect grant build canadian tran women research initi time endeavour give current climat tran health prime minist submiss inclus gender identifi canadian human right excit compon grant partner indigen research leader research wellb indigen women live risk principl truth reconcili canada indigen ethic guidelin includ nation inuit meti guidelin eye see research method loutfi work alli indigen research leader decad commit continu work contribut strength base cultur ground research indigen women includ work elder knowledg keeper indigen women success similar work racial black women prior year,-1,"health, environment"
100,"Enhancing and Expanding the ""Know Your Status"" Initiative in on-reserve Indigenous Communities in Saskatchewan: A Community-engaged Intervention to Increase Diagnosis, Linkage to Care and Prevention of HIV, HCV and STBBIs ( 2017/18-2020/21 )",Mona R Loutfy,Women's College Hospital,https://cognit.ca/en/research/project/147274,"First Nations people living on-reserve in Saskatchewan have the highest rates of HIV infection in Canada, with an incidence approximately 7.3-times higher than the national average. They also have the least access to care and to life saving antiretroviral therapy. To address this need, a comprehensive on-reserve HIV testing and treatment initiative called ""Know Your Status"" (KYS) was launched in 2011. KYS is a community-designed and community-managed program based on partnerships and collaborations between First Nations communities and care providers. Key components of KYS include: community involvement and leadership, education, prevention, specialized nursing support, support for mental health and addictions, lab testing and accessible and culturally-safe clinical management that meets clients where they are located. Culturally supportive services, such as mentorship from Elders and traditional teachings, are also integrated within the program. Thus far, KYS has been primarily implemented to care for HIV and sexually transmitted infections on a few on-reserve communities. However, there is a need to expand the program to include hepatitis C testing, linkage and treatment, as a result of similarly high on-reserve rates. The research team, in close partnership with First Nation communities, intends to refine, adapt, and expand the KYS intervention to communities with the greatest need. Traditional experimental designs to evaluate the KYS initiative cannot be used for various reasons. Instead, the team will use practical, though rigorous, methods to evaluate the effectiveness, acceptability and sustainability of the expanded KYS program, while ensuring that community needs are met. First Nations leaders and communities, policy makers and other physicians will be engaged throughout the project to build community and provincial capacity to treat on-reserve HIV and hepatitis C, and to ensure program sustainability for years to come.",0.1295833333333333,nation peopl live reserv saskatchewan highest rat infect canada incid approxim time higher nation averag access care life save antiretrovir therapi address need comprehens reserv test treatment initi call know status launch communiti design communiti manag program base partnership collabor nation communiti care provid compon includ communiti involv leadership educ prevent special nurs support support mental health addict test access cultur safe clinic manag meet client locat cultur support servic mentorship elder tradit teach integr program primarili implement care sexual transmit infect reserv communiti need expand program includ hepat test linkag treatment result similar high reserv rat research team close partnership nation communiti intend refin adapt expand intervent communiti greatest need tradit experiment design evalu initi reason instead team practic rigor method evalu effect accept sustain expand program ensur communiti need nation leader communiti polici maker physician engag project build communiti provinci capac treat reserv hepat ensur program sustain year come,-1,"health, environment"
